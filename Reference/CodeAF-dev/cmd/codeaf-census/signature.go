// ── ONE SIGNATURE PER KIND OF FAILURE ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// Four thousand failing rows in ten days are sixty kinds of failure, and the
// difference between the two numbers is entirely ids, addresses, durations and
// machine names. A census that grouped on the raw sentence would report four
// thousand singletons and say nothing; one that groups on a signature reports
// that one bound of this build's own cut nine hundred live streams.
//
// WHAT IS TAKEN OUT IS WHAT VARIES BETWEEN TWO INSTANCES OF THE SAME BUG, and
// what is left in is everything that names the bug: the status a router put in
// its own sentence, the shape of the complaint, and whether it arrived inside
// an opened stream.
