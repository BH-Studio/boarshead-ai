// ── WHAT A RETRY CHAIN IS, AND WHY IT IS RECONSTRUCTED RATHER THAN READ ──────
//
// One `id` is one ATTEMPT: a retry gets a fresh id and an incremented attempt,
// so nothing in the file says "these six rows were one question". The chain has
// to be rebuilt, and the design (§8) says how: rows that share a tag, a node and
// a model, whose attempt number rises, within fifteen minutes of each other.
//
// IT IS THE READING THE WHOLE RECOVERY DESIGN TURNS ON. A chain that never left
// the machine it started on is a retry that meant "again" rather than
// "differently", and the first census found that was true of more than half of
// them — three of which spent sixteen and seventeen consecutive sends on one
// rate-limited queue over eleven minutes and still ended refused.

// chainGap is how far apart two attempts may be and still be one question. A
// person who waited a quarter of an hour and asked again is asking again, not
// being retried.
const chainGap = 15 * time.Minute

// chain is one question's attempts, in the order they went out.

// machines is every machine this chain was served by or asked for, in order and
// without immediate repeats — which is what makes a chain that moved readable
// beside one that did not.
//
// SERVED FIRST AND THE DEMAND SECOND. `lane` is who the preference asked for
// and `served` is who answered, and on a third of this log's rows they
// disagree; a chain read from the demand alone reports a walk that never
// happened (DESIGN.md §1's third reading).
