package main

// engine.go is the far half of `codeaf chat --host devbox`: the process that
// ssh starts on the other machine, holding the real conversation and answering
// frames about it on its own stdin and stdout (internal/remote).
//
// IT IS MACHINERY, NOT A COMMAND. It is deliberately absent from the usage text
// because there is nothing a person accomplishes by typing it — it draws
// nothing, reads no keys, and speaks a protocol. A surface dials it; that is the
// whole of its audience.
//
// STDOUT IS THE PROTOCOL AND NOTHING ELSE. One stray line of chatter there is a
// frame the surface cannot parse, which is the end of the session rather than a
// cosmetic fault, so everything this door has to say to a human goes to stderr
// and only when it is fatal.
//
// ── IT IS ALSO, NOW, A DOOR ONTO SOMETHING ALREADY RUNNING ───────────────────
//
// Version 2 of the wire separated a conversation's life from a connection's, so
// this door has two shapes and tries them in one order:
//
//  1. ATTACH. Dial this workspace's session host (internal/enginehost) and
//     splice the ssh pipes to its socket. The conversation is already there,
//     possibly mid-turn, and closing the lid does not end it. If no host is
//     running, one is started and this connection waits a moment for it.
//  1a. AND THE HOST IS ASKED WHICH BUILD IT IS FIRST. A host outlives the
//     binary that started it, so `rm bin/codeaf && make build` on this machine
//     leaves the NEW codeaf answering `codeaf version` while the OLD one is
//     still holding the socket — and a splice that copied bytes handed the new
//     surface straight to it. What came back was the old host's own refusal
//     about protocol versions, telling the person to update a machine they had
//     just updated. So the socket is asked (internal/remote's whois.go) and a
//     host of another build is retired and replaced rather than attached to.
//  2. THE PIPE. If a host cannot be reached or started for ANY reason — no
//     socket directory, a path too long for a unix socket, a spawn that failed,
//     a machine that refuses all of it — this process serves the conversation
//     itself, exactly as version 1 did, and the welcome says
//     [remote.Welcome.Persistent] is false so no surface promises a lifetime
//     this shape does not have.
//
// THE SECOND IS NOT A DEGRADED MODE, IT IS THE FLOOR. A machine where the host
// cannot work must still take a remote session.

//
// ── THE RULE: THE OLDER ENGINE GIVES UP THE SLOT ─────────────────────────────
//
// On 2026-09-23 a new `codeaf engine --daemon` exited without a word because a
// two-day-old engine, started from a different binary, held the workspace. The
// windows went on talking to it, and conversations it had open refused the new
// build with "open in another window". The file-replaced retirement
// (internal/enginehost's binary.go) never fired, because nothing had replaced
// ITS file: a different file was simply newer.
//
// So an engine from an OLDER build is replaced whenever a newer one arrives,
// busy or not, and the window says so in one line. It is not asked first: an
// older engine is stale by definition, the conversations it holds are closed
// properly on the way out (every journal flushed; a turn it catches stops where
// it is and keeps its partial reply, as ctrl+c does), and the next connection —
// this one — reopens them on the current build. Windows that were attached to it
// see their connection end and redial onto the replacement.
//
// WHAT MAKES TWO BUILDS THE SAME ONE IS THE SOURCE AND THE FILE. A host of this
// source running from this file (or one that does not say which file) is this
// build's engine, whatever minute the two were linked in (#730), and is joined.
//
// WHICH IS OLDER IS THE BUILD MOMENT AND NOTHING ELSE, and a tie is never a
// replacement. That is what makes the rule converge: two windows on two builds
// agree on which one is older, so the newer engine is never replaced by a window
// of the older build, and two copies of one binary cannot take the slot from
// each other forever. A host too old to answer the question at all is older than
// everything.
