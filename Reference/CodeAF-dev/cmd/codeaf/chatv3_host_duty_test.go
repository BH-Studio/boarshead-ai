// hostOptions keeps four readings of the far machine warm on goroutines of its
// own. These pins are the three laws chatv3_host_duty.go states: a duty with no
// connection never starts, a duty that dies lets go of its latch, and the
// surface hears about it once.

// faultLog parks the standard logger in a buffer for one test, so a recovered
// panic can be read back — and so that a test which must NOT produce one can
// prove it. It is what guard.Note writes to.
