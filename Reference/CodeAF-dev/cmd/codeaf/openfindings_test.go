// THE TEXTUAL RUN OF 2026-08-29 (s9), AT THE MOMENT IT STOPPED TELLING ANYBODY.
//
// Its coverage gate measured the same two unexercised behaviours on all three of
// its rounds — 2, then 2, then 2 — and those three rounds briefed fourteen
// nodes. THIRTEEN OF THE FOURTEEN NAME NEITHER BEHAVIOUR; one names one, by luck
// of the planner's wording. The job measured its shortfall three times, spent
// fourteen leaves on it, and never once told a worker what it was.
//
// The findings were structured when they were measured and were flattened into
// prose on the only path that mattered: written into a goal, handed to a
// planner, and restated in whatever words that planner chose. A model
// summarising a page of instructions drops a two-item list most times it is
// asked.
