// ── `codeaf serve`, `codeaf chat --at otter-lamp-42`, `codeaf devices` ───────
//
// The three doors of reaching a machine WITHOUT ssh. One machine holds an
// outbound connection open and shows a pairing code; a device pairs with that
// code once and afterwards just opens; and the machine that owns the work lists
// and stops the devices it has let in.
//
//	big-machine$ codeaf serve
//	  this machine is reachable as  otter-lamp-42
//	  pair a new device with code   715 302   (valid 10 minutes)
//
//	laptop$ codeaf chat --at otter-lamp-42
//	  pairing with otter-lamp-42 — enter the code shown there: ______
//	  paired. this device is now a key to otter-lamp-42.   [chat opens]
//
// THIS IS A SECOND DOOR AND NEVER A REPLACEMENT ONE. `--host` over ssh is the
// floor and stays the floor: zero infrastructure, nothing of ours to trust, and
// a debugging story that cannot be beaten. `--at` is for the machine ssh cannot
// reach — behind a home router, on a work network, on a phone — and everything
// it needs beyond the two commands is a relay service that this build does not
// assume exists. When there is none, `--at` says so in one sentence and names
// the road that does work.
//
// THE PROMPT LAW, INHERITED FROM chatv3_host.go AND FOR THE SAME REASON:
// EVERYTHING THAT MIGHT ASK THE PERSON A QUESTION HAPPENS BEFORE THE SURFACE
// TAKES THE SCREEN. The pairing code is typed on a plain terminal, at a plain
// prompt, while stderr is still the terminal's. A TUI that came up first would
// draw a frame over the top of the one question this door has to ask.
//
// AND THE ENGINE IS THE MACHINE'S OWN `codeaf engine`, started as a child, one
// per connection — the same shape ssh gives it, so the far half of this door is
// code that has been running in production since the ssh door shipped. What is
// new here is the pipe, and only the pipe.
