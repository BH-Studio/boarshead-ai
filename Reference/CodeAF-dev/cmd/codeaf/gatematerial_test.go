//
// A gate read twelve verbatim technical profiles — `**Milvus** — …` through
// `**FAISS** — …`, in the order the person listed them — and returned "the
// deliverable does not contain the 12 profiles together in one final message …
// it contains a series of separate messages, each describing or pointing to
// individual profiles written to files". Not one clause of that verdict
// describes the text it was judging; every clause of it paraphrases a lesson
// distilled from an EARLIER verdict and injected above the material.
//
// The prompt now fences the deliverable so the judge can tell the material from
// the lessons by position. This test pins the half that does not depend on a
// model reading the fence: a deliverable that contains, verbatim, the things the
// review says are missing does not buy a repair round over them.
