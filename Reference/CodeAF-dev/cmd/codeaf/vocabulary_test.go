// in a product where *budget* means dollars everywhere else. Both moved. The
// three tests below are the whole of what "moved" is allowed to mean:
//
//  1. every old spelling still works, is absent from `--help`, and says on
//     STDERR what it is called now;
//  2. that notice never reaches stdout, so `--json` stays parseable;
//  3. one concept is spelled one way on every door, checked against the tree
//     itself rather than against a list somebody keeps by hand.

// captureNotice runs a door with the rename notice pointed at a buffer, and
// hands back what was said AND WHAT THE DOOR RETURNED.

// and then died as an unknown flag, or that was refused its old value, or that
