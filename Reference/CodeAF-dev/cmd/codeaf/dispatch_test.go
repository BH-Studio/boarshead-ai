// Dispatch is the seam between "the work has been decided" and "the work has
// begun", and it is the one place in the product where nothing is happening on
// purpose. A leaf that has been planned, spliced and left pending is a job the
// person is waiting on while the machine is idle.
//
// This is the headless configuration deliberately, because the headless brain is
// where the pathology was caught at its worst: a compiled leaf sitting pending
// with an empty started_at for fifteen minutes, until a 900-second ceiling
// killed the run — while the reconciler beside it ticked happily once a second
// and every other surface reported a healthy resident. Claiming has no
// chat-only nudge behind it and must not acquire one; the guarantee is that the
// dispatch loop, on its own, takes the work the instant it exists.
