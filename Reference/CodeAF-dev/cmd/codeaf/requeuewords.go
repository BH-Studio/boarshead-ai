// requeueWords is the ↻ line for a claim that went back on the queue with a

// banked it.
//
// TWO FACTS, TWO SOURCES, NEITHER OF THEM RE-WORDED HERE. The count is the
// release payload's own — the same number the next claim's resume seed is built
// from — and the why is the release's own reason with its turn-count clause
// taken off by the package that wrote it ([resident.ReleaseWhy]). Composing the
// why here from anything else is how a stream ends up saying one thing on the
// ⏳ line and a different thing one line under it.
