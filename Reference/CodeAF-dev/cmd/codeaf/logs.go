// The model-call log from the command line.
//
// `codeaf logs` is the reading end of internal/calllog: the file every model
// call in the process writes a line to, always, without a proxy in front of
// anything. The file is JSON Lines because a machine reads it too; this command
// exists because a person does not want to.
//
// One line per call. A call that is still in flight shows as one — that is the
// whole reason the log writes a row on the way OUT as well as on the way back:
// a planning call four minutes into a 65,536-token ceiling used to be
// indistinguishable from a process doing nothing at all.
//
// THE READER SHOWS EVERYTHING THE RECORD HOLDS. A field that is on the row and
// not on the line is a field a person has to leave the tool to read, and the
// half of the row that used to be invisible — the lane asked for, the lane that
// answered, what was done about a silence and what it cost — is exactly the
// half somebody opens this command to see. Anything the row does not carry is
// absent rather than zero.
