// (internal/remote's wire_teams.go).

// IT IS BUILT LIKE [hostStanding], for the one call the surface makes on its
// loop. [tui3.TeamsSeam.Load] is asked at an opening and must not block, so it
// answers what is held and nothing else; when nothing is held yet it says so,
// and the surface asks [tui3.TeamsSeam.ReadSince] off its loop, once, which
// fills what is held. Every other door here is called from a command and may
// take a round trip: the Traffic clock's turn, and the write an edit queued.
// There is no clock of its own: the surface's Traffic clock is the only thing
// that asks again, and it runs only while a managed team is held.
//
// NOTHING HERE READS THIS LAPTOP'S PROFILE. The teams a window over --host
// draws are the far machine's, or none: an engine without the doors gets no
// seam at all ([hostTeamsSeam]), and the surface turns teams off rather than
