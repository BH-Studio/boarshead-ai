// wallFlag is a hard wall typed the way every other duration in the product is
// typed: with a unit, `5m` or `2h`. It exists because `codeaf do` took its
// wall as a bare integer of seconds while `CODEAF_PRACTICE_IDLE 20m`,
// `CODEAF_BRIEF_AFTER 4h` and `--max-hours` all take units, so a person who
// had typed `20m` anywhere else typed `5m` here and was refused with a parse
// error (#376).
//
// A BARE NUMBER IS STILL SECONDS, FOR ONE RELEASE. Every script that passes
// `-timeout 900` keeps working exactly as it did; the grace is written on the
// flag's own help line so nobody has to remember it.
