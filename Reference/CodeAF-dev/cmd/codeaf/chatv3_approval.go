// reaches is the whole of what went wrong here — the trio was minted once around
// the boot agent and went on pushing into it after /new had closed it — and
// internal/session keeps the standing gate private, as it should. Narrowing the
// parameter to the method that is actually used lets a test hold the receiving
// end and say which conversation was written to, without any of internal/session
// growing a reader for the sake of a test.

// The consent card's door back to disk: where "always" is written down.

// surface together, because they answer the same question against the two rows
// that can answer it: tools.approval names a tool, tools.bashPatterns names a
// command line, and the card knows which of the two it is looking at.
//
// It lives in its own file beside chatv3.go for chatv2_rail.go's stated reason:
// the seam that lets the v3 surface reach a registry row is a different thing
// from the window's assembly, and keeping them apart means a wave editing one
// does not collide with a wave editing the other.
//
// THE PROFILE IS THE PLACE. A repository's .codeaf/config.json is never written
// from here — it is a file a team commits, and a keystroke on a consent card
// must not commit to somebody's repository. internal/config's approvalmemory.go
// states the honest consequence: while a repository answers one of these rows,
// its answer replaces the person's WHOLE at launch, so what is written here
// takes effect everywhere except inside that repository.

// saveToolApproval remembers one tool's allow in the person's own profile.
//
// The error is returned rather than dropped here, which is the ONE difference
// from saveRail's shape (chatv2_rail.go). The rail's caller has nothing left to
// say once the sidebar has moved; this one's caller is about to print a receipt
// claiming the answer was saved, so it has to be told whether that is true. The
// failure is still dropped — the surface drops it, silently, and keeps the
// session-scoped always it always had.

// person writes in the settings sheet on purpose.

// bankToolApproval and bankBashApproval are the two seams the surface actually

//
// THE SECOND HALF IS WHAT MAKES THE FIRST HALF MEAN ANYTHING TODAY. Without it,
// pressing always saved a preference that the running gate could not see, and
// the only thing stopping the next question was internal/session's
// session-scoped memo — which covers this agent's remaining life and nothing
// beyond it. The rebuild is the same v3Policy the launch ran, over the same
// three rows through the same project layer, so a banked rule reaches the gate
// by exactly the road it would have taken on the next launch, minus the launch.
//
// THE WRITE'S ERROR IS THE ONE THAT TRAVELS. The surface is about to say
// "saved" and it must be told whether that is true (internal/tui3's Options
// says why), and what is true is whether the row reached the disk. A rebuild
// that then fails has not made the write a lie: the rule IS saved and the next
// session will read it, so the error is dropped and the gate already standing
// stays standing. That case needs a settings file to have stopped parsing
// between the write and the read a moment later, which the launch's own read of
// the same rows would already have refused to start on.

// not exist yet, and assembling it is the launch's own job done again.
