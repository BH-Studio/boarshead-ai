package main

// testenv_test.go gives this package's tests a machine of their own, because the
// suite was running on the DEVELOPER'S machine instead.
//
// WHAT IT COST. Several doors here are exercised end to end — `codeaf exec "a
// prompt"`, the rename rows in vocabulary_test.go — under the belief, written
// into those tests, that every one of them "stops at a missing key". That is
// only true of a process with no key: on a laptop with OPENROUTER_API_KEY
// exported the same rows reached a live provider — real calls, real money,
// ninety seconds a row, and a deliverable plus a state directory written into
// the checkout under test. An offline suite that spends tokens is not one
// anybody can run before a landing.
//
// IT IS A FLOOR AND NOT A CEILING: t.Setenv still wins for a test that means
// it, and a variable this process was deliberately started with is left alone
// — except the profile, which is cleared unconditionally, because its
// deliberate set is the hazard rather than a courtesy.
