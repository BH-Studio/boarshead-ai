// THE STANDING GATE ON COMMAND ENTRY POINTS THAT NOTHING DISPATCHES.
//
// `runChat` sat at the top of `cmd/codeaf/chat.go` for weeks with no caller:
// `main` sent `codeaf chat` to `runChatV3` in every arm, and the six thousand
// lines under the dead entry still read as though a chat window ran the
// resident scheduler. Nothing in the compiler notices that — an unexported
// function with no caller is not an error in Go — and a reader has no way to
// tell a live road from a dead one except by tracing the dispatch by hand.
// That trace cost a whole recon pass on #323 before it was filed as #329.
//
// So the shape is held here: EVERY `run<Command>` IN THIS PACKAGE IS REACHABLE
// FROM `main`. A road that loses its dispatch fails this test in the same
// change that orphans it, while the author still knows whether the road was
// meant to die or the switch arm was meant to stay.
//
// The reachability is deliberately GENEROUS — a name mentioned anywhere in a
// reachable body counts as called, receivers are not resolved, shadowing is
// ignored, and one name reaches EVERY declaration that bears it, methods on
// unrelated types included. Every one of those choices errs the same way: a
// generous walk can call a dead road live, and it can never call a live road
// dead. That is the property a gate needs — it fires on nothing but a genuine
// orphan, so it needs no exception ledger beside it. Package-level variable
// initialisers are roots alongside `main`, because a function handed to a table
// is dispatched just as truly as one named in the switch.
//
// The generosity has one edge worth naming: `var _ = runSomething` would count,
// so a road could in principle be kept alive by a reference that dispatches
// nothing. That is a line a reviewer reads in a diff, which is the same bargain
// `SIZE-BUDGET` and `.github/known-red.txt` make.
