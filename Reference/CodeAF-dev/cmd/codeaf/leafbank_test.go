// THE INK RUN OF 2026-08-29, AT THE MOMENT ITS MONEY DISAPPEARED.
//
// `bench/deepswe/results/ink-grid-box-layout-…-s8` made a hundred and nine
// billed calls against `task-2` over seventeen minutes, wrote a twenty-six
// kilobyte patch, was given up on by its node watchdog, and left a store whose
// usage table held exactly one row — the planner's — because a leaf's spend
// reached the journal only through the outcome it hands back on the way out,
// and a leaf that is given up on hands back nothing. cost.json read $0.000228.
//
// The law this pins: EVERY BILLED RESPONSE WRITES ITS ROW WHEN THE RESPONSE
// ARRIVES. Two calls billed and then an ending that never lands still leaves
// two rows, and the landing roll-up that used to be the only record must not
// write a third over the top of them.
