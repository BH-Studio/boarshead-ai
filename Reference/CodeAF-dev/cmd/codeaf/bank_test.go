// A craft job's root leaf ran a benchmark campaign for the better part of an
// hour: four algorithms implemented, three datasets benchmarked, a progress row
// at every step, and at the finish line "The comparison writeup for all four
// algorithms is now pulled together into one document". Then its first attempt
// hit its time ceiling. The node watchdog returns no outcome at all in that
// case, so everything the attempt reached lived in exactly two places — the
// journal and the job directory — and the retry read neither. It started cold.
//
// It does not any more. The bank is what those two places say, composed under
// the same headers a re-decomposed leaf already gets.
