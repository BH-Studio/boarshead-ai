// The claim-time half of decomposition, wired.
//
// The mechanism lives in the resident package; what lives here is the one thing
// this process owns and that package must not: which plan document a claimed
// node belongs to, and which lock guards it. The registry is the same one every
// leaf resolves itself through, so a division edits the document a revision
// sentinel is also editing rather than a second copy of it read back out of the
// journal.

// jitExpander builds the runner's claim-time division.
//
// The planning client is this process's, not the job's. A job's retained client
// is the one its leaves run on — the work model — and a division is a planning
// question asked of the planning model, the same one the build asked it of.
//
// planContextTokens is that model's window, read from the catalog by the caller
// — the surface owns the catalog and hands facts down, the same doctrine the
// leaf's own context length travels by. Zero is the honest answer for a model
// jitExpander builds the runner's claim-time division.

// divisionTarget resolves a claimed store node to the plan node it was minted

// Not ok is the ordinary answer and covers three cases that all mean the same
// thing: the node's id carries no plan node (a craft node, a bare splice), the
// job is not retained and could not be rehydrated, or the document holds no node
// by that id any more. All three run the node whole, which is what every node
// did before this existed.
//
// The one-leaf job used to be a fourth, and it was the only one that was an
// accident. A task-scale ask is spliced as a single node carrying the bare
// prefix, which is the same spelling a planned job's deliverable sink wears — so
// the id alone could not tell "this is the whole job's answer, never divide it"
// from "this IS the work". Refusing both meant a task-scale coding errand could
// never divide at claim, structurally, whatever the reading of it said, which is
// the commonest job there is left out of the one mechanism that decides shape
// against what is really there. The document draws the distinction the id
// cannot (resident.SoleWorkNode), and the judgment is the free predicate's, as
