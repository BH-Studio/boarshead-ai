// chatv3_layout.go is where a v3 conversation lives, and which one a launch
// opens (docs/CHAT-V3.md, Decision 26).
//
// A session is a FOLDER: ~/.codeaf/v3/projects/<encoded-workspace>/<id>/, with
// the transcript, the sidecars, the node journals and — for an owned session —
// the workspace itself inside it. internal/session's place.go is the arithmetic
// on that folder; this file is the three decisions a launch makes before the
// arithmetic can start:
//
//   - WHICH PROJECT. The workspace is the git root of the directory the person
//     stood in, so `codeaf` typed in repo/cmd and in repo/ is the same project.
//     The encoded directory name is a bucket and not an identity — meta.json
//     carries the real path — which is what lets the encoding stay dumb.
//   - BORROWED OR OWNED. A conversation opened inside a project borrows it and
//     litters nothing; one opened nowhere at all owns a workspace of its own.
//   - WHICH CONVERSATION. The newest one the PERSON spoke in, an empty one
//     reused rather than duplicated, or a new one — and the other empties are
//     reaped on the way past.
//
// EVERY PATH GOES THROUGH internal/home, so CODEAF_HOME moves all of it.

// say what it is, stays, because the rule reaps what is PROVABLY litter and
// leaves everything else alone forever — applied here to a much bigger file. A
// journal torn by a lid closing mid-write, one line past the scanner's buffer,
// or a schema this build has never seen all look like silence to a reader, and
// none of them is silence. Hiding somebody's conversation on the strength of a
// failed parse is the more expensive mistake by far, and [v3ReapEmpty] is the
// only rm -rf on the launch path.
//
// That is why the question is put to [session.SpokeIn] and not to
// [session.Peek]: Peek folds "read it all, nobody spoke" and "could not read
// it" into one false, which is right for a picker row and fatal for a delete.
