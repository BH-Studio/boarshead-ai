// person's disk — where their deliverables are indexed, and what an owned
// workspace is when it is first made — and a launch function that also held
// them would be a function nobody could read the launch out of.

// SESSION writes rows for the pictures it paints and the SURFACE writes rows
// for the conversations it exports, and two spellings of one path would be two
// indexes with half a person's work in each.

// prepareOwnedWorkspace makes an owned session's work/ directory and, silently,
// a git repository out of it.
//
// WHY A REPOSITORY NOBODY ASKED FOR. An owned session is one opened nowhere in
// particular — $HOME, a temp directory, a launcher — and until now that was the
// one kind of session that ran with none of the machinery a repository buys:
// task nodes got no worktrees, so they ran in place with no isolation, no
// auditor and no merge (Decision 19), and every document the agent touched was
// edited with no way back. The repository is what turns those on, and the
// person never has to know it is there: they did not choose a project, so there
// is nothing here that was theirs to be surprised by.
//
// THE INITIAL COMMIT IS THE POINT, not a formality. A repository with no HEAD
// has no commit to branch from, and `git worktree add` against it fails — so a
// session that had been init-ed but never committed would look isolated and
// behave exactly like one that was not. The commit is empty because there is
// nothing in the directory yet, which is precisely the state worth recording:
// "this is where the session started".
//
// FAILING IS NOT FATAL, and that is the whole of the error handling. git may be
// missing, a sandbox may refuse the write, a hook may be broken — and none of
// those is a reason to refuse somebody a conversation. What the session loses
// is isolation, which it never had in this mode anyway; what it must not do is
// PRETEND to have it, so the loss is one line on stderr and the caller carries
// on (Decision 26 — pretending to isolate is worse than not isolating).
//
// The one error it does return is the directory: a workspace that could not be
// created is not a workspace, and a session pointed at a path that is not there
// fails at its first tool call instead of at its launch.
