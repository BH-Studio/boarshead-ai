// that matters, and nothing at all about what to do next. Every message a
// person reads must carry THE CAUSE and WHAT TO DO, and may not leak a Go type,
// a wrapped chain, a package name or a path from inside the binary.

// machineryVerbs are the wrapping verbs the packages inside this binary put in
// front of a cause.
//
// They are NAMED ONE BY ONE and matched WHOLE, deliberately not guessed at by
// shape: a rule that dropped every short lower-case segment would also drop

// ── THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S WORDS ARE NOT codeaf'S ────────────────────────────
//
// A filesystem failure arrives as an [os.PathError] wrapped on every floor it
// passed on the way up:
//
//	open notebook: stat /home/x/.codeaf/graph.db: no such file or directory
//	create chat workspace: mkdir /nope: permission denied
//
// `stat`, `mkdir` and `open` are the names of system calls — a library's words
// written for another library — the path is the only fact in the whole line,
// and nothing anywhere says what to do about it.
//
// THE RULE IS STRUCTURAL AND NOT A LIST OF SITES. A chain that ENDS in a
// syscall fault is a chain whose front is the binary saying what it was doing
// when the disk said no; the tail names the path itself, so the front carries
// nothing a person can act on and is dropped whole. That is why this needs no
// per-door decision and no per-door edit: every command in this binary reports
// through one line (main.go), so the doors that spelled `open notebook`, `open
// receipts`, `open store` and `create chat workspace` are all answered here
// without any of them being touched.
//
// What is deliberately NOT claimed is which flag named the path. Six doors take
// a path under four different flags, and a sentence that guessed `--dir` at a
// door whose flag is `--db` would send somebody to the wrong knob with
// confidence — the same reason [remedies] is short.

// syscallVerbs are the operating-system operations Go puts in front of a path.
// They are named one by one, like [machineryVerbs] and for the same reason: a
// rule that took any lower-case word before a path would swallow `splice parent
// "task-1"` and half the sentences a person can actually act on.
