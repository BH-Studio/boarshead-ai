// ── THE PROCESS'S LANE-SHEET BEAT ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The router publishes, per model, one row per machine serving it, and that is
// a free prior for every lane a request might be sent to (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md,
// Decision 10). Fetching it was a SESSION'S errand, and three doors of this
// binary build no session at all — `do`, `run`, and a subharness — so a
// headless install wrote sightings forever and never once read a sheet: no
// cache under `v3/lanes/`, no facts in the belief, and a chooser ranking the
// one machine the last run happened to be served by (issue #318).
//
// SO THE BEAT IS THE PROCESS'S, seated at [installMeasuredRulers] — the one
// function every surface that records anything already calls before it reads or
// writes a profile. A beat started per door would be the same fetch loop
// written four times, and the fourth would drift.
//
// A SESSION STILL STARTS ITS OWN and nothing about it changed. Whichever asks
// first runs the loop and the other hands its models to it, because [lanes.Beat]
// admits ONE BEAT PER SHEET and joins the rest through the queue it already had.

// laneBeatCtx is the lifetime of every beat this process starts. It is the
// process's own, cancelled at the one exit every command shares ([execute]),
// beside the belief writer that runs for exactly as long.
//
// It is a variable rather than an argument because the seam it is read at —
// [installMeasuredRulers] — is called from six surfaces that have no context
// worth threading: the beat outlives every one of their requests and belongs to
// the process instead. Background is what a test gets until it says otherwise.
var laneBeatCtx = context.Background()

// startLaneBeat begins this process's lane-sheet beat, or does nothing at all.
//
// THE TWO REFUSALS ARE THE SESSION'S, WORD FOR WORD (internal/session's
// agent.go). Routing off is a person saying they do not want their endpoints
// chosen for them, and a background fetch would be work nobody asked for on
// somebody who asked for the opposite. A door with no model slot filled has
// nothing to fetch a sheet about.
//
// THE BASE URL IS NOT A THIRD. This seam used to run no beat unless the base's
// hostname said `openrouter.ai`, which left every headless run pointed at a
// proxy, a mirror or a router reached by its IP with no sheet at all (issue
// #373). Whether a base publishes an endpoints page is the base's own to say,
// once, on the first refresh; a base that says there is none is left alone
// until that answer is stale, so on such a base the beat is one quiet request
// every five minutes rather than a feature that is absent.
//
// AND THE SHEET IS WIRED HERE, from the settings, before the beat starts. On
// `run` and on a saved program the beat is seated before any client is built,
// and a beat over an unwired sheet fetches nothing on its first pass and then
// waits a whole interval — so the base and the bearer the settings already
// name are handed over at the seam that needs them. The client built a moment
// later wires the same base again, which the sheet treats as the same fact
// told twice ([provider.WireLaneSheet]). Nothing here blocks: wiring is a
// field write, and the fetch is the goroutine's.
//
// The interval is [lanes.Beat]'s own and is not restated here: a second
// spelling of that number is a number that would drift.

// laneBeatModels is the models this process actually sends to, deduplicated and
// without the empties.
//
// IT IS THE SLOTS AND NOT THE CATALOG, for the reason the session's own list
// gives: these are models a run will really open a connection to, while the
// fallback list is what a turn reaches for only when no endpoint would take the
// request at all — and a sheet for every one of those would be paying, on every
// run, for a refusal that usually never comes. The model this seam was called
// with leads, because it is the one the caller resolved and the one the work
// will ride; the two config slots follow for the door that has not resolved one
// yet.
//
// IT IS THE LEDGER'S NAME FOR EACH SLOT AND NOT THE OPERATOR'S. A slot may hold
// a floating alias — the shipped default is one — and the router publishes an
// endpoints page under the concrete model it points at, never under the alias
// ([lanes.LedgerModel]).
