// ── EVERY PAGE OF HELP FITS THE TERMINAL IT IS READ IN ─────────────────────
//
// `codeaf --help` was a hundred and eight lines that drew a hundred and
// sixty-seven ROWS on an eighty-column terminal, because its longest line was a
// hundred and sixty-four cells. Every second line was therefore folded by the
// terminal, at a break nobody chose, INSIDE A WORD — `resuming you|r last
// conversation` — and the twenty-five-column hanging indent stopped aligning
// the moment it happened. The one page that has to be readable was the least
// readable thing this binary printed, and `codeaf help env` was worse: a
// reference table whose widest row was a hundred and sixteen cells.
//
// IT IS MEASURED IN DISPLAY CELLS AND NOT IN BYTES. That is the whole reason
// [wrapAt] exists and the whole reason [ansi.StringWidth] is what measures a
// row everywhere else in this binary: the em dashes and the `·` these pages are
// full of weigh three bytes each and draw one cell, so `len` would call a
// perfectly good line over-wide and — on a combining accent — a bad one fine.
//
// AND IT READS THE DOORS, NOT THE VARIABLES. `usageText` is a concatenation:
// the exit ladder is folded into it from envelope.go, the cache word from
// cache.go, the dollar figures from internal/config. A test that measured the
// literal would measure a page nobody sees. So every page here is captured from
// the door that prints it, exactly as a person gets it.
