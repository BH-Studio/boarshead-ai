// The cache from the command line: what it holds, and the one destructive verb
// that empties it.
//
// `codeaf cache` answers the question and changes nothing. `codeaf cache clean`
// deletes ~/.codeaf/cache — the shared toolchain caches every task worker fills
// (internal/cachedir says what lives there and what never does) — and because a
// deletion cannot be undone it is guarded the way destructive command lines are
// guarded everywhere a person has already learned: the blast radius is printed
// first, sizes and path included, and then the confirmation is a TYPED WORD
// rather than a y. `rebuild` asks [y/N] because the journal survives it; this
// one actually destroys bytes, so the answer that proceeds is a word written
// out, and any other line — including an empty one, including EOF on a pipe —
// keeps everything. --yes is the scripted door and skips the question, which is
// rebuild's own arrangement.
//
// AND THE WORD IS THE SAME WORD THE CHAT WANTS. In the chat the deletion is
// `/cache clean now`, because the chat cannot pass a flag; here it used to be
// the word "clean", so the one prompt in the product that deletes gigabytes
// asked for a different word depending on which surface a person had learned
// first. One word, [cacheCleanWord], in both. `--yes` stays as the script's
// spelling and is not a word anybody types at a prompt.
