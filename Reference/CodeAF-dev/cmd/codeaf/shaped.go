// repairJournal is where the structured-answer seam's repairs are written down.
//
// internal/shaped knows how to get an answer out of a model that was cut off or
// answered in prose; it deliberately knows nothing about a graph, so it announces
// what it did to whatever journal the door installed on the context. This is that
// journal for both doors that have a store: the run's own, keyed to the node the
// repair belongs to.
//
// FAILSAFE.md clauses 3 and 4 are the whole of why it exists. A repair costs
// money and time and changes what somebody watching should expect; a run that
// repaired itself twice must not be indistinguishable, afterwards or at the
// time, from one that never had to.

// written is not a reason to stop a run that is otherwise recovering.
