// chatv3_exchange.go is the door's half of `ask here` — home's second action
// row, which answers an errand ("remind me at 6", "tell me when CI goes red")
// without opening a conversation the list would then have to hold forever
// (tui3's homeexchange.go, docs/AMBIENT.md Part 5).

// ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// MERGE NOTE (lane errand). Everything in this file is new, and the only line
// this lane added outside it is the `Errand:` / `StandingRoot:` pair in
// chatv3.go's tui3.Options literal. If that literal has moved under another
// lane, the pair is the whole of what has to be carried across.

// IT IS THE /new DOOR WITH THE FOLDER TAKEN OFF IT. [v3NextSession] mints a
// session folder in THIS project's bucket and hands back where it put it, which
// is exactly the thing an errand must not have: a folder under v3/projects is a
// row on home, and asking from home exists so that an errand is not one. So the
// surface names the folder — under the standing root, where nothing scans — and
// this points the same config at it. The model, the roles, the rail and the
// gate are all properties of the LAUNCH and are inherited unchanged; the gate is
// re-read AS IT STANDS NOW for the reason chatv3_approval.go gives.

// differs from Fresh. An errand asked with the cursor on another project is
// about THAT project — a CI watch belongs to the repository it watches — and the

// Nothing else about the session moves with it: the approval gate is still this
// launch's, re-read now, because a window's rules are the person's rules
// wherever the sentence points.
