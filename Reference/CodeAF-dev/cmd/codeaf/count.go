// countFlag is a whole number typed at a flag, refused with a sentence about
// the flag rather than with the number package's own word for it.
//
// `codeaf logs --tail notanumber` answered
//
//	invalid value "notanumber" for flag -tail: parse error
//
// `parse error` is [strconv]'s message reaching a person through two layers,
// neither of which wrote it for anybody to read: it says nothing about what the
// flag takes and nothing to do next. The same binary already answers
// `--timeout hello` with `a duration such as 15m or 2h, or a number of seconds`
// ([wallFlag]), which is the standard this is held to.
//
// IT CARRIES THE FLAG'S OWN NOUN AND NOT A SHARED ONE. What a number means
// differs per flag — how many calls to show, how many turns to allow — so each
// door hands its own noun in and the refusal says it. The flag package already
// prints `invalid value "x" for flag -tail: ` in front of whatever [Set]
// returns, so the value typed and the flag it was typed at are there and are
// not repeated here.
