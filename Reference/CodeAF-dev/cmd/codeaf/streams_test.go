// THE RULE THIS READS THE TREE FOR: stdout is the answer — the deliverable, the
// JSON, the rows, the table, the thing a script captures — and everything a
// person reads ABOUT the run is an aside and goes to stderr (streams.go).
//
// It is structural rather than a grep because the doors that broke it were not
// spelled alike: `plan run` printed a `goal:` preamble, `logs` printed a path
// header, and `cache clean` printed its QUESTION into the stream a script was
// capturing — which is the worst of the three, because a `tee` of it hands the
// person a blank terminal waiting for a word they cannot see, and puts the
// question in the data file. So the test looks at the SHAPE of what is written
// and not at its words, and it reads string literals out of the syntax tree,
// never the source text: a sentence quoted in a comment about the old defect
// must not be able to satisfy or fail it.
//
// Two shapes, and each is commentary by construction:
//
//  1. A PROMPT — a literal that ends on a colon, a question mark, or a
//     bracketed choice like `[y/N] `, with no newline after it. Nothing that is
//     an answer stops mid-line waiting.
//  2. A LABEL COLUMN — a line of a literal that opens with a lower-case word, a
//     colon, and two or more spaces of padding to align a value after it. That
//     is the preamble style every headless door writes its `goal:`,
//     `workspace:`, `models:` and `panel:` lines in, and a table of results is
//     not written that way.
//
// THE BRACKETED CHOICE WAS THE HOLE ROW 28 FELL THROUGH, and it is worth saying
// exactly how, because the report guessed a different mechanism. `codeaf
// rebuild` asked its question through a writer that arrives as a PARAMETER —
// and that was never the problem: the parameter is named `output`, which is one
// of [answerWriters], so the call WAS scanned. What the scan could not see was
// the SHAPE. The question mark ended its own line, and the half that actually
// waits for a keystroke ends `[y/N] ` — no colon, no question mark, nothing the
// two rules above recognise. So a prompt written the way every yes/no prompt in
// the world is written was invisible, and the rule now names it.
