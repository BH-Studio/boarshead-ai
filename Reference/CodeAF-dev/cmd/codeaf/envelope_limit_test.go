// ── `error` MEANS ONE THING, AND A LIMIT IS NOT IT ──────────────────────────
//
// envelope.go states the contract in the field's own doc comment: `error` is
// "why the run did not produce an answer", and is "empty on every run that
// produced one". `--json` is a contract a script is written against, so that
// sentence is the law and the code moves to match it.
//
// `codeaf exec` did not. It copied EVERY executor error into `error`, while
// [execStop] deliberately keeps `budget`, `turn-cap` and `deadline` when the
// executor hands back an outcome and an error together — so a run cut off by
// its own token budget, holding half an answer, published the answer AND an
// error at once. A script following the written contract either threw the
// partial answer away or reported a startup failure that never happened.

// envelopeFields is the object a caller actually parses: the envelope through
// its own marshaller, so the extra fields a verb carries are read the same way
// a script reads them.
