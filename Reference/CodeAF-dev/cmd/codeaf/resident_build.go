// newResidentReconciler assembles the store-driven resident role shared by an
// interactive chat owner and a bounded wake pass. Surface concerns are added
// by chat after this returns; wake deliberately has no session-open or arrival
// brief side effects.
// The three clients divide by the kind of call: chatClient talks (compiling,
// distilling, titling, narrating — the resident's own small verdicts),
// planClient structures (the task graph, replans, contracts, the delivery
// gate), and taskClient executes leaves. By default plan follows work, so the
// split is dormant until a plan model is chosen.
// oneShotErrand says this reconciler serves `codeaf do`: one errand, run once,
// with nobody who could answer a question about it. It is a fact about the
// surface, not a judgement about the work, and it travels to both halves that
// would otherwise have to guess it — the compiler's temporal classification and
// the reconciler's charter draft.
//
// It is the only signal the verbatim law needs, and it is the right one: the
// compile stage is unchanged for everybody, and the reconciler that applies the
// result is the one thing that already knows which surface asked. On this
// surface the submitted sentence survives the compile as the goal
// (resident.keepTheAskVerbatim); on every other one the compiler's reading and
// its declared assumptions are the point, and nothing here moves.

// compileIntent turns one user instruction into a compiled goal.
//
// The cache key is "compile" rather than the instruction, and that is the whole
// reason this is a named function. A cache key is an affinity handle: it asks
// the endpoint to send every call in one lineage back to the instance already
// holding that prefix. Compilation has no lineage — it is a single call — so
// keying it on the user's words minted a fresh key for every message and
// scattered compiles across providers, and the 5.5 KB compiler prompt was
// written cold every single time. One constant key keeps it warm from compile
// to compile, exactly as "distill", "gate", "narrate" and the rest already do.
// The standing-charter compiler runs on this same context and inherits it.
//
// plans is here for one reason and it is not planning: the compiler's structural
// reading of the ask — the thing scale is reconciled from — has no seat on
// resident.Compiled, because nothing between the compile and the splice acts on
// it. The journal wants it anyway, so it is left as a memo keyed on the goal
// both halves share. A nil registry simply drops it.
//
// planClient is here for the acceptance checklist and nothing else. THIS IS THE
// ONE PASS IN THE SYSTEM THAT HOLDS THE REQUEST VERBATIM: everything downstream
// holds the compiled goal, which is this program's reading of the ask. A
// checklist of what the person asked for has to be read off the person's own
// words or it is a standard we wrote for ourselves, and the gate may not hold
// anybody to one of those (docs/design/gate/ACCEPTANCE.md, and the grounding
// invariant in internal/revision/grounding.go that says the same thing about a
