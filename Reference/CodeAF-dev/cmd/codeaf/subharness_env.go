// THE HEADLESS ENV: the six host doors with nobody standing behind them.
//
// This is the whole capability surface a subharness gets from `codeaf run
// subharness` (docs/SUBHARNESS-PRD.md §9, the "Headless" bullet). It implements
// [exec.Env] and NOTHING IN THIS FILE MAY REACH THE TASK SYSTEM — the PRD says
// it in one sentence, "the headless path must not import the task system", and
// the reason is structural rather than tidy: a run's roster row, its room and
// its ✕ are a PRESENTATION of a run, so a headless door that reached for them
// would make the presentation part of the definition and there would no longer
// be a way to run a program without a conversation around it.
//
// What is different here is not that the doors are weaker. It is that there is
// NOBODY TO ASK, and every door that would have asked somebody says so out loud
// rather than deciding on their behalf:
//
//   - [headlessEnv.Ask] takes the answer the gate declared in advance, or stops
//     the run. It never invents one. That is the anti-pattern this whole command
//     exists to not repeat — internal/subharness/exec_model.go's gate
//     AUTO-APPROVES when no Ask was wired and writes "nobody was there to ask,
//     so it carried on" into the trail afterwards, which is an apology rather
//     than a decision.
//   - [headlessEnv.Tool] refuses anything the approval policy would have put in
//     front of a person, on exactly internal/session/consent.go's reasoning:
//     blocking would hang a run forever on a question with no reader, and
//     allowing would make "prompt" mean "allow" wherever the surface is not a
//     terminal.
//
// EVERY CALL IS JOURNALED BEFORE ITS ANSWER RETURNS (internal/exec/journal.go).
// The journal is the only account a headless run leaves of itself, and summing
// its entries is how the run's ledger is computed — which is why no door here
// may return without writing its row first, including the doors that refuse.
