// THE INK RUN OF 2026-08-29, AT THE MOMENT IT LOST ITS MEMORY.
//
// `bench/deepswe/results/ink-grid-box-layout-…-s6` spent $0.850 and its whole
// ninety-minute wall on one leaf that started five times, each time from turn
// one, each time by exploring a repository it had already been editing for
// twenty-two minutes. testdata/ink-s6-task-2-transcript.json is that node's
// record as the store held it at the first release: attempt one's seventy-two
// turns (ending on a recorded fault, "context deadline exceeded") followed by
// attempt two's first forty-five.
//
// The three things a resumption owes its successor are asserted against it: that
// the seed is ONE attempt, that it carries what was DECIDED across the whole of
// that attempt rather than only its last twelve turns, and that the run says out
// loud how much it resumed from.
