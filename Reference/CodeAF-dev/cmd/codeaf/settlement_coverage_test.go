// The measured run: a delivery gate's coverage finding named the one behaviour
// that was dead in the delivered tree; the repair round it asked for was refused
// `goal-already-covered` by a model reading the plan's own Done and the workers'
// own summaries; and the refusal came back as `Overturned: true` with the
// sentence "the job's own reading of what it is judged on found nothing left
// uncovered, so the review's finding is what was wrong" on the deliverable. The
// person was also told "1 behaviour the request states has no check" over two of
// them, because the finding grouped its points by the line of the request they
// were read from and the request was one line.
//
// Three things are pinned here at once, because one run produced all three and
// any of them alone still ships a dead feature: the count is the point count,
// the gap is left standing, and no governor writes the acquittal sentence.
