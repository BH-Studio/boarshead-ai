// ── THE ONE WAY THE v3 SURFACE IS RUN ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// Four doors open the same surface: the in-process door (chatv3.go), the ssh
// door (chatv3_host.go), the relay door (chatv3_at.go), and the unix-socket
// door a plain `codeaf chat` takes when a session host already holds this
// workspace (chatv3_local.go). Everything that is true BECAUSE THE SURFACE OWNS
// THE TERMINAL belongs here rather than at any of them, because a rule stated
// four times is a rule three doors will eventually be missing: the logger
// redirect was written once, at the in-process door, and for as long as it lived
// there the other three left the standard logger on stderr and any line written
// to it tore straight through the alt screen (#404).

// runSurface is the ONLY path in this command to [tui3.Run], and every door
// takes it. It arms the byte meter the surface paints through, parks the
// standard logger in the profile's chat.log for the surface's whole lifetime,
// and hands the terminal back with both undone.
//
// A door that called tui3.Run itself would compile and would look right; what
// it would lack is everything below, which is why [TestOnlyTheSurfaceHelperRunsTheV3Surface]
// reads this package's sources rather than trusting the next door to remember.

// stack (internal/guard), a checkpoint warning, a media fallback — spliced into
// whatever the person is typing, and gone with the next repaint. So the logger
// goes to a file beside the profile for the surface's whole lifetime and comes
// back on the way out. It is the SAME file a fault appends its stack to
// (fault.go's [chatLogPath]), so "what happened" has one answer; an empty
// profile is the state root there and never the working directory.
//
// A PROFILE THAT CANNOT TAKE THE FILE KEEPS STDERR — a lost frame is better
// than a lost warning. The surface still runs, and the line lands somewhere a
