//
// It is assembled here for the reason every other registry on this path is
// (chatv3_harness.go): where the bundles live is the SURFACE'S decision, and a
// package that opened ~/.codeaf/subharnesses itself would open it from a test and
// from a task node's own agent too. internal/session is handed the four seams and
// nothing about a directory.
//
// THE WHOLE OF IT IS SILENT ON FAILURE, which is [v3HarnessEntries]'s posture
// carried over word for word: a store that cannot be read, a client that cannot
// be built and a workspace that cannot be resolved all mean SUBHARNESSES OFF —
// the doors in internal/session answer nothing, calmly, and the surface draws
// nothing. A registry is not worth failing a launch over.

// v3Subharness is what one conversation is handed. THE ZERO VALUE IS
// SUBHARNESSES OFF: every field is the nil [session.Config] already treats as
// "this build has none", so a caller assigns all four without asking whether the
// wiring worked.

// subharnessLastRun is the DIM NOTE UNDER A ROW: when this program last ran, how

//
// ── TWO STORES, ONE ANSWER, AND WHY IT IS READ RATHER THAN WRITTEN ──
//
// A subharness has two doors, and until this reading merged them the two doors
// disagreed about the same program:
//
//   - Every run started through `/subharness` — the only road a bundle or a
//     compiled-in worker has — leaves a one-line note in the HOME STORE, written
//     by internal/session the moment the run lands (its subharness_run.go).
//   - Every run of a PAGE — whichever list started it — leaves a whole trace in
//     the PAGE STORE, written by the one run door this surface builds
//     ([v3RunHarness]), because that door is what `/harness` and `/subharness`
//     both end up calling.
//
// So a page run from `/harness` was invisible to `/subharness`: the note was
// never written, and the row went on saying nothing about a program that had run
// four times that afternoon.
//
// THE FIX IS ON THE READ SIDE AND DELIBERATELY SO. The obvious alternative — the
// `/harness` road also writing a home-store note — would give ONE fact TWO
// writers, and the second of them would be writing into a store it has no other
// business in. Neither store can see the other's runs (a bundle has no trace to
// save; a page's own trace is what its history IS), so each stays the authority
// for what it can actually observe and this reader asks both and answers with
// WHICHEVER IS NEWER. A run that wrote to both — a page started from
// `/subharness` — describes the same run twice and either answer is true; the
// note is the later stamp of the two and so it wins, which keeps the cost the
// trace never carried.
//
// The words are neither store's ([subharness.LastRunLine]): `/harness` draws
// this same sentence about this same program from its own trace, and one
// vocabulary is what makes the two lists one surface.
