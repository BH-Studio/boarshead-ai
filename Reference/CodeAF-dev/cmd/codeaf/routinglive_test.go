// ── THE ROUTING ROW IS INSTALLED, NEVER HANDED DOWN ─────────────────────────
//
// THE MEASURED FAILURE (issue #1022). This door read the routing row and wrote
// it onto the session's config, which the session handed to every client it
// built as an answer OF ITS OWN — and an answer handed down beats the row this
// process installs, which is what a caller holding a row this process did not
// install needs it to do. So the conversation's clients were pinned to the word
// that was on disk at launch: somebody cycled `routing` in the settings panel,
// watched the row change, and went on being routed by the old word until they
// relaunched.
//
// The fix is an absence, and an absence is the one thing a reader cannot see, so
// it is asserted here: the door installs the row and hands down nothing.
