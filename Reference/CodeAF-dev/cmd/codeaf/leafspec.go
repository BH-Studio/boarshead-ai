//
// There is exactly one because there used to be two authors, chosen by scale
// rather than by worker: a task-scale job's spec was the compiler's goal plus
// the method it wrote in the same breath, and a project-scale job's was a plan
// brief plus a plan contract. Two authors and no object is how a retry could
// silently produce a third spec — a title and a summary — with none of the
// specificity the first two had.
//
// The order below is the order of authority, and the last answer is the empty
// spec, which renders to the empty string and leaves every caller on the path
// it took before specs existed. That is what makes the wave a read swap to roll
// back rather than a migration.

// nowhere to hang a spec: the working method was carried in a memory map that a
// restart emptied, and the criterion had nowhere to live at all. One node is a
// plan. Journaling it costs one event and buys the task-scale job everything
// the project-scale job already had — a durable spec, a criterion that survives
// a retry, and a structure the revision pass can read.
//
// The graph is minted, not planned: no call is made here, and the two strings
// are the ones the compile call already produced.
