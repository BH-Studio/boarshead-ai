// before it builds a brain, and the brain reads these three fields rather than
// resolving any of them a second time.
//
// IT CARRIES ONE PATH, NOT TWO. It used to keep the store's resolved path
// beside the spelling a `--db` flag was given in, because the v2 chat door
// parsed that flag and `~/store.db` and `/home/…/store.db` are different
// strings for one file. That door is gone (#329), the only caller left resolves
// the path before it opens anything, and a second field that always held the
// same value was one more thing to keep in step.
