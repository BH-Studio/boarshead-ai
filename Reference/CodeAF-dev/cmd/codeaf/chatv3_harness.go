// THE OTHER HALF OF THE HARNESS OFFER.
//
// internal/session decides WHETHER a sub-harness takes a turn: it matches what
// somebody typed against the registry, raises one card, and waits for the
// answer (its harness.go). It deliberately knows nothing about what running one
// means — Config.RunHarness is the seam, and until this file existed the seam
// was nil, which is detection off. So the card could never appear, and a
// registry a person had saved harnesses into was a registry nothing could run.
//
// This is the surface's side: the registry the card is matched against, and the
// runner a yes reaches. Both are wired at launch, from things this process
// already has — the state root's store, this session's provider settings, the
// workspace — and neither performs a network request to be built.
//
// WHAT A YES ACTUALLY GETS. The program is walked by internal/subharness's own
// runner over the model bridge (its exec_model.go): an agent.loop with tools is
// the provider's bounded tool loop and one without them is one completion; each
// tool.call is one of the seven bare tools below; each verify and each free-text
// condition is one small judgement; and the walk — the branch law, the loop's
// rounds, the dynamism budget — is the package's, unchanged. The run's trace is
// saved beside the harness and the trail comes back as the turn's answer.
//
// TWO THINGS ARE NOT WIRED, and they are absences rather than gaps:
//
//   - THE GATE HAS NOBODY TO ASK. A human.gate auto-approves and says so in the
//     trail. This surface's questions are all about a call the model just made
//     (the consent card) or an account it reached for (the connect card); there
//     is no free-text ask to bridge to, and inventing one on the way past would
//     be a second question lane nobody designed. A harness with a real gate
//     wants the session's own loop, which is the next wave's work.
//   - THE MODEL IS THE ONE THE SESSION LAUNCHED ON. /model moves the
//     conversation, not this client, because the client is built once here and
//     the session exposes no hook to follow. A node that names its own model
//     overrides it either way, which is the field that exists for exactly this
//     — and so does a TURN that named one: "research the pricing tiers with
//     opus" reaches this file as the run's model, resolved to an id the session
//     checked against the same catalog the picker draws (its harness.go), and
//     is handed to the bridge as the default every agent.loop node rides.

// harnessTimeout bounds one node's completion. It matches internal/session's
// own provider timeout: a harness node is a non-streamed call like the title
// call is, and the backstop is against a wedged endpoint rather than a limit on
// how long a run may take.
const harnessTimeout = 10 * time.Minute

// v3HarnessEntries is the registry as DETECTION reads it: one entry per saved
// harness, at its head version.
//
// The entries carry no cue list, because a harness page has none to carry — the
// store holds programs, and [subharness.Entry.Cues] is a designer's trigger
// vocabulary that nothing yet writes down. That is not a hole to paper over: a
// harness with no cues is found by NAMING it ("run the research harness", which
// is the naming signal at 0.9) and by nothing else, so the card appears when
// somebody asked for it by name and stays quiet otherwise. When cues land on
// the page, they land here.
//
// A store that cannot be read answers with nothing, which is detection off. A
// registry is not worth failing a launch over.

// the ordinary turn, not a reason to refuse to open a conversation. The session
// checks this seam for nil before it matches anything (its harness.go).
// THE SEAMS ARE THE CONVERSATION'S OWN, handed down whole rather than
// reassembled here, so that a run's belt carries the same generation verbs the
// conversation's does, the same absences, and — the half that was missing — the
// same answer about where what it makes lands and how the person finds it again.
// Every one of them may be zero, which is a machine with no media models writing
// to the legacy rung, and a harness belt of seven wire tools, exactly as before.
