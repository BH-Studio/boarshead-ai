// ── `codeaf chat` through this machine's own session host ───────────────────
//
// This is the third dialer and the first one with no machine in it: the surface
// runs here, the session runs in this workspace's session host
// (internal/enginehost), and between them is a unix socket rather than an ssh
// child or a relay tunnel.
//
// It is the ordinary road now, which is the whole point — the work a person
// starts goes on when the terminal closes, and the next `codeaf chat` here sits
// back down in the same conversation. [v3HostRoad] is the rule, and it says
// which launches keep the in-process door instead: onboarding, --once, --debug
// and --no-host.
//
// Everything below the dial is the ssh door's own code. The client, the welcome,
// the surface's options and the headless run are [openChatV3Host]'s, called with
// an empty machine name — the seam this build spells as "linked, local".
