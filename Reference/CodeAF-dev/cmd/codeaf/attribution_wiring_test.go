// Both entry points build their own executor, and a setting honoured at one of
// them is a setting the user cannot trust. The construction sites sit deep
// inside the resident dispatch and the headless run, past a live provider and a
// real store, so this reads the wiring instead: every place that builds a leaf
// loop has to pass the model-name row into its signature.
//
// The resident's site is the constructor table now rather than chat.go — a
// worker is chosen per node, so the choice and the construction moved together —
// and chat.go builds no loop of its own at all. That last part is the invariant
// worth keeping: a second construction site growing back inside the dispatch
// path is exactly how one of these settings gets honoured in one place and not
// the other.
