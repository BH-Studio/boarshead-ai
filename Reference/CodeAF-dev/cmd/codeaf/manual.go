// The manual from the command line: every page this build carries, one page as
// it is written, or the sections that answer a question.
//
// It exists because the manual had exactly one reader and it was not the person.
// Everything codeaf knows about itself was reachable only through the belt's
// `manual` tool — which is a model call, so it needs an API key, costs money on
// every lookup, and hands back a RETELLING that nobody can tell from an invented
// one. That is the exact failure internal/manual was written to prevent, and the
// questions people ask most are the ones they ask BEFORE any of that is set up:
// what is this, what does it cost, what can it do, who can see my files.
//
// So this command needs no key, makes no model call, opens no store, spends
// nothing, and prints the pages VERBATIM. A person reading the manual here is
// reading the manual.
//
// AND NOTHING HERE IS CUT SHORT. internal/manual's caps exist because a model
// pays for its context by the token; a terminal does not, and a page truncated
// on the one surface where the whole of it is free would be a budget wearing a
// reason it does not have. Paging is the terminal's job, not this command's.
