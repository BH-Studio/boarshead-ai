// host over a socket, that is every question the engine raises. It was measured:
// three minutes on an `ask`, no block, no chip, the turn still running. This is
// the assertion the compiler cannot make for us — internal/remote cannot import
// internal/tui3 — so it is made here, where the door already holds both halves.
