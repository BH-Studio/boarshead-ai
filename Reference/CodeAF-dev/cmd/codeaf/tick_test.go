// THERE ARE EXACTLY THREE PLACES A KEY CAN COME FROM and all three are shut
// here, because the alternative is a test that quietly buys a real judgment on
// somebody's account. [config.LoadKeyless] resolves the key through
// [config.APIKeyAt], which reads OPENROUTER_API_KEY, then OPENAI_API_KEY, then
// the `api_key` field of `config.json` in the profile — and nothing else: there
// is no keychain seam and no second file. Empty reads as unset for the two
// variables. The profile is the one that hides: it is [config.ProfileDirEnv],
// taken straight from the environment rather than from the state root this test
// already moved, so a developer with CODEAF_PROFILE_DIR exported would have
// reached their own persisted key past every temporary directory here. It is
// pointed at an empty one, which has no config.json and therefore no key.

// do nothing is not allowed to demand credentials before it finds out
// (chatv3_standing.go's v3StandingTicker builds keyless).
//
// THE MACHINE IS KEYLESS ON PURPOSE AND THE TEST DOES NOT SKIP. Both variables
// are emptied rather than merely left alone, so this is the same walk on a
// developer's shell as on the CI runner — and so a key that IS exported can
// never turn the last step below into a real model call somebody pays for.
//
// The probe is a command every machine has rather than the `gh run list` this
// was written with, so that what the walk reports is this build's own doing and
// not whether the box has the GitHub CLI installed.
