// ── NO MACHINERY VOCABULARY IN THE TERMINAL READER ─────────────────────────
//
// `codeaf why <id>` and `codeaf rebuild` are the two commands whose whole job is
// to hand a person a record, and both handed them a word out of the code
// instead. The record's own notes were signed `the harness` — which names
// neither who wrote the line nor what happened, and spends on the machinery a
// word this product already uses for the saved shapes of work a person builds
// by name. The rebuild receipt counted `nodes`, which are `steps` in the `--json`
// envelope, on the task page, and everywhere else a person is shown a count of
// the same things.

// A NOTE IN THE RECORD IS SIGNED `codeaf`, THROUGH THE REAL DOOR.
//
// The store is written and then read back by runWhyTo, rather than the headline
// function being called directly, because the defect is what a person sees after
// typing the command and every layer between here and there is part of that.
