// chatv3_media.go is Decision 5 of docs/MULTIMODAL.md's v3 revision: ONE KNOB
// PER MODALITY, resolved AT USE TIME.
//
// The double-knob era is what this closes. The settings sheet carried a row for
// the drawing model that nothing read, beside a role pin that the engine obeyed
// and no surface showed; the looking row and roles.vision were two names for
// one question and disagreed on a fresh profile. So there is one resolver, it
// is asked at the moment something draws rather than at boot, and it walks one
// documented ladder:
//
//	1. THE SETTINGS SLOT — the row a person actually opened and chose, read
//	   from the profile at the moment of the call (config.MediaSlotModelAt, and
//	   config.VisionModelAt for looking). A choice made in the sheet is live in
//	   the running session, not on the next launch.
//	2. THE ROLE PIN — roles.<name>, the operator's free-text second rung.
//	3. THE CATALOG — the best model the catalog advertises publishing the
//	   capability (config.CandidateMediaModel).
//	4. THE CURATED NAME — what this build remembers (config.FallbackMediaModel),
//	   which is what makes a machine that has never opened settings still draw,
//	   speak and film out of the box.
//
// EVERY RUNG IS CAPABILITY-CHECKED against the catalog's published modalities.
// A slot or a pin naming a model that cannot do the job is passed over with one
// log line and the ladder carries on, so a renamed slug degrades to the best
// available model instead of arriving at a provider as a 404. This is the
// promise Decision 3 made and the first wiring never kept.
//
// THE EIGHT WORDS the resolver answers to, and what each one asks the catalog:
//
//	image       output image     — the model that draws
//	speech      output speech    — the model that speaks (the catalog aliases
//	                               the provider's broad "audio" onto this)
//	music       output music     — the model that composes. It is its own word
//	                               and not a reading of speech: the two ride one
//	                               endpoint and are two different models, and a
//	                               TTS row that publishes only "speech" is
//	                               correctly refused here
//	video       output video     — the model that films
//	vision      input image      — the model that looks at a picture and
//	                               answers in words
//	transcribe  input audio      — the ear: sound in, words back, on the
//	                               dedicated transcription endpoint
//	listen      input audio      — a CHAT model that can be handed a sound and
//	                               talk about it
//	watch       input video      — a CHAT model that can be handed a film
//
// The first five are session.Config.MediaModel's own contract; the last three
// are the perception belt's (the media/hear lane). The four INPUT words all
// demand text back as well, because a model that takes sound and answers in
// sound is a speaker rather than a listener.

// can: its curated fallback names are its own ids and its catalog carries the
// rows. A DIRECT service can only if its own catalog says so — the fallbacks
// are OpenRouter's ids (config.FallbackMediaModel) and a direct vendor has
// never heard of them, so arming the pair on a listing alone puts four verbs on
// the belt that cannot succeed and re-opens the hole the empty catalog closed.
