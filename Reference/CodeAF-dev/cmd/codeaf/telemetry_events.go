// ── counting a hosted session from the events it receives ───────────────────
//
// The session counters tick where the session loop runs (internal/session's
// sealTurn and executeTool, internal/provider's calllog). Over a host link the
// loop runs in the session host — a separate process, or a separate machine —
// while session_started and session_ended are spooled by the chat process,
// whose own tally has seen none of it: a hosted chat's end event carried zeros
// for every count. The events the chat process receives already say what
// happened, so the agent it hands the surface counts them on the way through.
//
// A session this process runs itself — --no-host, --once with no host
// answering, onboarding, --debug (chatv3_local.go's [v3TakeHostRoad]) — is
// already counted at the source, and counting its events again would double
// every number. The tell is the agent's own type: a *remote.Agent fronts a
// session another process is running, a *session.Agent is this process's own.

// answered. Only the four doors that hand back a stream are overridden; the
// wrapper asserts to *remote.Agent no better than the agent it wraps does, so
// a door that could not reach that type before still cannot. Steer is left as
// it was on purpose: its tail is the running turn's own stream, of which the
