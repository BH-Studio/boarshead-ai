// `codeaf exec` mapped `exec.StopError` onto `stopError`, and `stopError` is
// the rung whose published meaning is "it could not be run at all — no key, bad
// arguments, the store would not open". But `exec.StopError` IS AN OUTCOME: the
// executor writes it from inside the turn loop when a model call fails and
// cannot be absorbed (internal/exec/linear.go). So a run that reached turn
// nine, spent real money and was holding half an answer left with the number
// that says it never began — and a script branching on the ladder either
// retried it as a startup failure or threw the evidence away.

// A run that got as far as turn nine and then broke.
