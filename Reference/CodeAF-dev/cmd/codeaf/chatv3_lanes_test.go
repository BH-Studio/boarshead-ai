// THE THREE ROAD-DEPENDENT CAPABILITIES, DECIDED ONCE.
//
// A harness design, a subharness intake card and an adaptive run's fuel gate
// each reach a person on a standing subscription, so each is a question about
// the ROAD between the session and the screen rather than about the machine.
// chatv3.go used to answer them one way and engine.go another, in prose, which
// is how a lane comes to be lit on one door and dark on the other with nothing
// saying so. These pin that there is one answer and that both doors take it.

// builderName says which of the two session builders a shape chose. Comparing
// the closures by their code pointer is the only way to ask the question from
// outside, and the question is worth asking: "runs are on" and "build through
// v3OpenSession" are one fact, and a shape that set the lane and picked the
// plain builder would turn the verb on with nothing behind it.
