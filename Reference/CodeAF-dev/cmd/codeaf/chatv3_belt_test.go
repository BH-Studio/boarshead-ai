// THE SEAMS THE BIG MACHINES ARE BUILT FROM.
//
// build_harness, list_harnesses and propose_task are absent from the belt rather
// than broken when their machinery is missing (internal/session's tools.go),
// which is the right posture and a silent one: a door that forgot to fill a seam
// ships a model that simply never has the verb, and nothing anywhere says so.
// internal/session's belt_wiring_test.go pins what filling the seams buys; this
// pins that THIS DOOR fills them.
//
// THE ADAPTIVE SEAM IS HERE WITHOUT A HAND ABOVE IT. `run_adaptive` was the
// fourth of these and is off the belt outright now (internal/session's
// tools.go), so OrchestrateRunner no longer buys the model a verb — it buys the
// engine a caller, for the one door left onto a planned run: a person naming one
// in so many words (internal/session's orchestrate.go). An unfilled seam there
// is a cue that answers nothing, which is exactly as silent a failure.
//
// The gates, and what fills each here:
//
//	build_harness, list_harnesses   HarnessStore + RunHarness + AskConsent
//	propose_task                    a conversation rather than a task node
//	the anchored adaptive cue       OrchestrateRunner + AskConsent
