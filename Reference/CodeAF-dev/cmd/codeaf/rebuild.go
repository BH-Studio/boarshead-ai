// The whole architecture rests on one claim: every table in this database is a
// projection of the journal, and can be thrown away and rebuilt from it. Store.
// Rebuild is the routine that makes the claim good — and it had no caller
// outside the test suite, which meant the claim was only ever exercised where
// it was already believed. A guarantee nobody can invoke is an aspiration.
//
// So there is a command. It is the operator's recovery path from a corrupted
// view, and it is also the only way a future event kind whose view write was
// forgotten will ever be noticed: replay writes what the live path wrote, and
// the difference shows up here or nowhere.
