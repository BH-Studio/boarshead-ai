// hostFar is the far machine as the background duties are given it: the
// connection, and the one place a sentence about a duty goes.
//
// IT IS THE ONE SEAM A DUTY IS ARMED THROUGH. The four readings hostOptions keeps
// warm behind the surface — the places, spending, memory, the standing items —
// each hold their wire door as a closure ([hostStanding] says why), and a closure
// made from a nil client is a perfectly good function right up until it is
// called, on a goroutine, where the nil dereference is a panic the guard swallows
// and nobody sees. So the fact "there is a connection behind this" is established
// here, once, and every duty asks it before it starts rather than finding out on
// the wire.

// hostDuty is one background reading of the far machine: the latch that keeps
// one round trip in flight at a time, the clock that says when the last one came
// back, and the door it leaves through. Three laws, and the type exists so that
// they are written once rather than four times:
//
// A DUTY WITHOUT A CONNECTION DOES NOT START. [hostFar.arm] says whether there
// is a client; a duty armed with none refuses every trip, so the surface reads
// what it holds — nothing — and no goroutine is ever sent down a nil.
//
// A DUTY THAT DIES LETS GO OF ITS LATCH. The latch is taken before the trip and
// used to be released inside it, after the answer came back — so a trip that
// panicked never released it, the next reading saw a fetch still out, and the
// page froze on whatever it held for the life of the process, with nothing said.
// The release is deferred here, so a beat later the question is asked again
// exactly as it would be after an ordinary error.
//
// AND THE SURFACE HEARS ABOUT IT ONCE. The fault is recorded where every fault
// is (guard.Note), and one sentence goes to the notice line the first time a
// duty falls over — once, because a duty that fails on every beat would
// otherwise be a notice on every beat, and the log already holds each of them.

// hands a reader its own closure gets without arming anything.
