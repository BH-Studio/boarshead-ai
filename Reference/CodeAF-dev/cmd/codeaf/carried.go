package main

// `codeaf <name> …` for a program this build carries (internal/delegate): the
// verb every one of them answers, from a person's shell and from the chat's
// own run alike.
//
// TWO CALLERS, ONE LINE. The chat's run starts `codeaf senior-dev run --json
// --dir … -- <brief>` as its child, with the model API's address and token in
// the child's environment; a person types the same verb at a shell with
// neither. The environment is how the two are told apart: a child of a host
// runs the program's body here and writes its records on stdout; a shell run
// becomes the host itself — it serves the model API and starts the same child.
//
// ── A SHELL RUN IS THE SAME TWO PROCESSES A CHAT'S RUN IS ───────────────────
//
// The host reaches models the way every headless verb does — the person's own
// profile, its services and its keys (config.Load) — and serves them to the
// program through a model API of its own (internal/provider/modelapi), exactly
// as the chat's run does: the program is started as a child of this very
// executable with the API's address and token and no key, every call it makes
// is metered, held to the ceiling the person set, written to this machine's
// spending ledger, and kept as one turn of a conversation log in the run's own
// record folder. What the chat draws on a task page, the host prints as lines.
