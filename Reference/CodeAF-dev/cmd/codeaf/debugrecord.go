// openDebugRecord is what every door calls the moment it has read the switch:
// it mints this invocation's run id and, when the record is on, writes the run's
// own header into a folder named after it (internal/trace's [trace.OpenRun]).
//
// IT IS ONE FUNCTION AND NOT THREE COPIES because the three doors differ only in
// the word they call themselves and where they were pointed. Everything else —
// what "the workspace" means when nobody named one, which build this is, when
// the run started — is the same answer at every door, and three copies of it is
// three places for it to drift.
//
// The context it returns is the run's, and the caller threads it into whatever
// it opens. A door that cannot thread one loses nothing: the run is also this
// process's own (see [trace.Begin]).

// THE RECORD PROMISES A PERSON THEIR KEY IS NOT IN IT, and a promise kept by
// shape alone is a promise kept for the shapes somebody thought of. Scrubbing
// by shape catches `Bearer …`, an `sk-…` token and a field named
// `authorization`; it does not catch a Google `AIza…`, a Groq `gsk_…` or the
// plain token a self-hosted endpoint was given, any of which a provider can
// echo back inside an error body. The literal values catch all of them, and
// this is the door — the one place that has both the profile and the record.
//
// It is called at EVERY door and before anything can make a call, because a
// value registered after the body that carried it is a redaction that arrived
// too late. It costs one read of the profile's config file on a run that is not
// recording, which is the same file the door is about to read anyway.
