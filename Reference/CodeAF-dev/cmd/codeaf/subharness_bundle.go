// THE ONE PLACE A BUNDLE ON DISK BECOMES SOMETHING THAT RUNS.
//
// internal/substore is the layout — the directories, the version records, the
// memory and the run notes — and it says of itself that it does not know what
// JavaScript is. internal/jsrun is the engine, and it says of itself that it has
// no filesystem. The two are deliberately unacquainted, and [substore.Build] is
// the signature where they meet: a store hands over a [substore.Bundle], and
// what comes back is an [exec.Runner] the registry cannot tell from a compiled-in
// Go one. This file is that function and nothing else, so a change to either
// side's shape is a change to one adapter rather than to every surface.

// subharnessBuild is the builder both surfaces hand to [substore.Store.Source].
//
// The look is the surface's, because it is the only half of a bundle that is a
// fact about WHERE THE PROGRAM IS RUNNING rather than about the program: which
// directory a file guard is asking about, and which belt a tool guard is asking
// about. Everything else comes off the disk.

// NAME — `summarise` — and its own resolver strips a `prompts/` prefix and a
// `.md` suffix off a ref before it looks. Handing the file names straight over
// would put every asset one suffix away from every lookup, and a program would be
