// ONE BOOT PASS, ONE-WAY, NEVER FATAL. A person who upgrades in the middle of a
// week of work must find their conversations where the new build looks for
// them, and must not be able to lose one to this pass. So every failure here is
// a file LEFT WHERE IT IS plus one line on the log: a corrupt old session must
// not cost anybody their new one, and a session another window is holding open
// is not touched at all.
//
// What moves, per flat transcript under ~/.codeaf/v3/sessions/<workspace>/:
//
//	<stamp>_<rand>.jsonl        → projects/<workspace>/<id>/transcript.jsonl
//	<stamp>_<rand>.state.json   → projects/<workspace>/<id>/state.json
//	<stamp>_<rand>.tasks.json   → projects/<workspace>/<id>/tasks.json
//	~/.codeaf/v3/tasks/<id>/    → projects/<workspace>/<id>/tasks/
//	<workspace>/tasks.jsonl     → projects/<workspace>/tasks.jsonl
//
// The id is the transcript header's own, which is what makes the folder's name
// the session's name from the first day of the new layout. A file whose header
// cannot be read has no name to be given and stays put.
