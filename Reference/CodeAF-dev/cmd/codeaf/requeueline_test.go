// ✗ IS THE FAULT REGISTER, AND A REQUEUE IS NOT A FAULT — AND THE LINE SAYS WHY.
//
// The headless stream said `✗ … picked up again — …` for every release that
// carried a reason, and once exhaustion started requeueing (exec.Requeued) the
// commonest of those became the ordinary end of a leaf that ran out of its
// room — announced one line under the ⏳ that had just said, correctly, that
// nothing had failed. Two marks, three lines apart, disagreeing about the same
// event.
//
// The register is chosen from the fact and not from the words: the release
// carries how many recorded turns it hands on, which is the same count the next
// claim's resume seed is built from.
//
// AND THE ↻ LINE STOOD ON THE LINE ABOVE IT FOR ITS WHY. It printed the count
// and threw the release reason away, so the bound that fired was legible only
// from the ⏳ the leaf happened to write just before — true of every release
// today, and an ordering assumption rather than a guarantee. The line now names
// the bound itself, and it must name it ONCE: the reason's own clause about how
// many turns survived is the count this line has already said in its own words.
