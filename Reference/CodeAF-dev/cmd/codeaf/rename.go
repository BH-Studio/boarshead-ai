// EVERY OLD SPELLING SURVIVES FOR ONE RELEASE, WORKS EXACTLY AS IT DID, IS
// ABSENT FROM `--help`, AND SAYS ONCE WHAT IT IS CALLED NOW.
//
// This file is the whole of that promise: the writer the notice goes to, the
// one sentence it is spelled with, and the two kinds of hidden flag a door can
// carry. It exists because the alternative — a rename that simply refuses the
// old word — breaks every script somebody has in production on the day they
// upgrade, and tells them nothing about what to type instead.
//
// THE NOTICE GOES TO STDERR AND NOWHERE ELSE. stdout carries the answer: the
// deliverable, the rows, the `--json` object. A deprecation sentence printed
// there would be one line of prose in front of an object a harness is piping
// into `jq`, so the rename would break the very callers it exists to protect.
// That is the reason [renameNotice] is a variable rather than os.Stderr spelled
// inline at each call: a test can read back what was on which stream, which is
// the only way to check a claim about printed text.
var renameNotice io.Writer = os.Stderr

// sayRenamed is the one sentence, said once, for a whole command that moved.
//
// ONE LINE, NOT A PARAGRAPH. A person who typed the old spelling wants to keep
// working; what they are owed is the new word and the fact that this grace ends.
// Everything else about the rename is in `codeaf --help` and in the manual.

// ── HIDDEN FLAGS, AND THE TWO KINDS THERE ARE ──────────────────────────────
//
// A hidden flag is one a door still answers to and `--help` does not print.
// There are exactly two reasons to have one and they have different lifetimes,
// so they are different functions and a reader can tell them apart at the call
// site:
//
//   - [renamedFlag] is an OLD SPELLING. It works for one release, it says what
//     it is called now the first time it is used, and then it goes.
//   - [shorthandFlag] is a SINGLE LETTER. `-w`, `-o`, `-j` are what fingers
//     already know; they keep working forever and say nothing, because there is
//     nothing to say — they are not deprecated, they are just not the printed
//     name.
//
// Both are registered as real flags writing through to the printed flag's own
// value, so `--budget 9000` and `--token-budget 9000` are the same assignment
// and [reorder] can ask the flag set whether either takes a value.
//
// THE MARK IS CARRIED IN THE FLAG'S OWN USAGE STRING rather than in a map on
// the side, because a map keyed by *flag.FlagSet is state that outlives the
// door it describes and has to be cleaned up by somebody. A hidden flag's usage
// sentence is never printed — that is what hidden means — so the field is free,
// and a NUL byte cannot collide with anything a person would write.
