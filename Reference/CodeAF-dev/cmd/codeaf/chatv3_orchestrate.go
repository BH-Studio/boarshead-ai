// THE OTHER HALF OF THE ADAPTIVE RUN — and it is a shorter half than the
// harness's, because the engine is already in the session.
//
// internal/session ships the whole run: the planner on this conversation's own
// client, the executor that makes each node a child agent, the fuel tank and the
// gate ([session.Agent.RunOrchestrate]). What it does NOT ship is a way for a
// turn to reach it. Config.OrchestrateRunner is the seam, the session checks it
// for nil before it offers anything, and until this file existed nothing filled
// it — so the engine had no caller outside its own tests, and the doors onto it
// were switched off in every build that ships.
//
// AND THERE IS NO DOOR LEFT ABOVE THIS SEAM AT ALL. The model's `run_adaptive`
// hand went first; the anchored cue a turn was read for ("orchestrate the
// migration") followed it, because a conversation may not open a planned graph
// (internal/session's loop.go carries the whole statement). So filling this seam
// arms nothing today: it is kept wired because the session's own run seams — the
// gate, the steering, the roster family and the room that draws them — are built
// against a bound agent, and a surface that could start a run the room cannot
// then find is the defect this arrangement exists to prevent.
//
// WHY A SEAM AT ALL, when the thing it reaches is a method on the very agent
// being built: because the config is what BUILDS the agent, so nothing here has
// an agent to close over at the moment the closure has to exist. That is the
// whole of [v3Runs] below — the config is handed a closure, the agent is built
// from it, and the closure is told which agent it belongs to before anybody can
// call it. It is deliberately not a package-level pointer: /new and /resume each
// build a conversation of their own, and a run started in one must be registered
// in the one the person is looking at, or the room that draws its graph would
// ask the wrong session for a snapshot.

// v3MachineLanes is THE ACCOUNT OF THIS MACHINE'S RUNNING TASK LANES, and there
// is one for the life of the process because there is one machine under it.
// /new and /resume each build a conversation of their own, and the memory half
// of the reading each one's admission governor takes is of this whole process
// and everything it started — /proc cannot say which conversation started which
// compiler. So what that reading is divided by has to be every conversation's
// lanes and never one conversation's, or a neighbour's build becomes this
// conversation's per-node weight for the rest of the session (internal/session's
// task_pressure.go, issue #907).
var v3MachineLanes = session.NewTaskLanes()

// v3OpenSession builds one v3 conversation with its adaptive runner wired to
// itself.
//
// EVERY DOOR THAT BUILDS A CONVERSATION COMES THROUGH HERE — the launch, the
// relaunch onto a fresh file when the first is locked, /new and /resume — for
// the reason the harness registry is opened once and handed to both halves: a
// session that could start a run the surface cannot then find is worse than a
// session that cannot start one.

// goroutine, and the binding is written on the goroutine that opened the

// practice — nothing can call a tool on an agent that has not been returned yet
// — and a data race that cannot happen is still a data race the detector is
