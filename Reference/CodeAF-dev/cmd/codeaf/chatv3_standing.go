package main

// The door's half of the ambient side: where the standing store lives, who
// ticks it, and what a firing is allowed to do.
//
// internal/standing owns the files and the pass; internal/session owns what a
// firing DOES (standing_run.go). This file is the seam between them and the
// person's own machine — the one place that says which directory, which daily
// rail, and which posture a firing runs under.
//
// ── WHO TICKS ──
//
// Any window that is open takes the store's lock and runs a pass every
// [standing.Interval]; the OS timer running `codeaf tick` is the backup for
// "no terminal open". Both build the ticker through [v3StandingTicker], so
// there is exactly one answer to "what does a pass do" and it cannot drift
// between the two callers.
//
// ── WHAT A FIRING MAY DO ──
//
// A firing runs under the person's PROFILE rules and not under a repository's.
// The gate a conversation runs behind is resolved per project (chatv3.go), and
// a checked-in file that could widen what runs while nobody is watching would
// be a repository granting itself permissions its author never met. So the
// posture below is resolved against the person's home directory: their own
// banked rules, and nothing a clone can add to them. Anything those rules would
// have asked about refuses, the run stops, and the item says it needs them.
