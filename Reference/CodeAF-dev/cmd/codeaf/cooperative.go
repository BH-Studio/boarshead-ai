// The cooperative split, wired.
//
// The mechanism is resident's; what lives here is the same thing jit.go's
// wiring owns and that package must not — which plan document a node belongs
// to, which lock guards it, and which registry the division's own document has
// to be put back into so the leaves it just minted can be looked up when they
// are claimed.
//
// It resolves through divisionTarget, the same function claim-time division
// resolves through, because it is asking the same question of the same node.
// A node that cannot be resolved there cannot be divided here either, and the
// caller's answer to that is the answer it already had: deliver the partial.

// splitAsAsked routes a leaf's own division request into the governed growth
// path, and reports how many nodes it added.
//
// Zero is the ordinary refusal and is not an error: the request was malformed,
// the node has no plan document, a governor said no, or the expansion came back
// as a division not worth keeping. Every one of those ends the same way — the
// leaf's partial is what the node delivers — which is exactly what a
// governor-refused overrun does, and the caller reads the count rather than
// learning four ways to be told no.
