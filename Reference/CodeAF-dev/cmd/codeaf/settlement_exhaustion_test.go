// A LEAF THAT RAN OUT HAS NO ACCOUNT.
//
// The measured run: a leaf hit its token grant mid-`sh` with a red build, took
// its four landing turns, printed `⏳ ran out of tokens — 33 turns` — and two
// seconds later the node was ✓ done, its summary its own last sentence, "All 722
// tests pass. Let me verify the dry-run tests specifically:". One 10k-token judge
// call, shown the brief and that sentence and nothing else, had said the leaf was
// finished, and `remainder.Done` overwrote the verdict. The two sibling tasks
// then briefed on truncated work. The turn the ✓ bought away — running the
// binary — is where the run's fatal defect would have surfaced.
//
// Here the judge is scripted to give exactly that answer, over a leaf that
// really does run out. Doneness is a claim; running out is measured; a measured
// fact is never overturned by an unmeasured claim.
//
// WHAT CHANGED IN #386, AND WHAT DID NOT. The delivery gate is not that judge
// and never was: it is shown the request, the record and the files, and a pass
// from it is a reading of the WORK rather than a claim about the worker's last
// sentence — so a cut leaf whose delivery was read and passed is now settled on
// it, and this run therefore ends on a verdict rather than on the queue. What is
// still refused, and what this test is named after, is the remainder judge's
// say-so: it says done here on every round, and not one node settles on it. The
// ⏳ is still answered by a ↻ and never by a bare ✓, and every completed node
// that ran out still has to name the thing that took its work on — a splice, a
// release, or a gate that passed.
