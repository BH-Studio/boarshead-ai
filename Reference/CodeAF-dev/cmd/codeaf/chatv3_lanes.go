// chatv3_lanes.go is the one statement of which standing capabilities a
// conversation's surface can hold, and the assembly that applies it.
//
// Three capabilities depend on the road between the session and the screen
// rather than on the machine. A design card, a subharness intake card and an
// adaptive run's fuel gate are raised on subscriptions that outlive their turn
// ([session.Agent.WatchHarnessDesigns], [session.Agent.WatchOrchestrations]), so
// a question raised on a road that cannot carry it is work nobody will be shown.
// In this process every road carries; over a connection the wire says which do
// ([remote.StandingLanes]).
//
// It is one file because it used to be two places: chatv3.go set HarnessCards and
// built through [v3OpenSession], engine.go nilled HarnessStore and built through
// session.New. Two doors answering the same question apart is how a capability
// gets fixed on one road and stays dark on the other.

// internal/session already reads each of these as absent rather than broken
// (nil HarnessStore is building off, nil OrchestrateRunner is orchestration
// off, and false HarnessCards is simply not offering the verb).
