// The plan-only non-answer, end to end. A blind UX rubric ran the same research
// journey five times against the same model: three runs came back with the right
// figures and a citation, and two came back with "I will look up the filings and
// compare" — a plan, handed over where the answer belonged, from a worker that
// had called no tools at all.
//
// That shape used to ship. The gate read a final message, saw text that promised
// nothing false, and had been told in its own instructions that silence in the
// run records never acquits nor convicts — so an empty record read as "the
// evidence is simply not available here" and it passed. The fix is structural
// where it can be: a run that was watched from end to end and called nothing now
// says so in words, which is the one record in that block that is complete
// rather than a tail, and the judge decides what to do about it.
//
// Everything below the script is the product's own: the compiler, the working
// method, the executor, the gate, the revision pass, the citation invariant, and
// the replan that splices the work a cited gap buys.
