// ── WHICH OF `codeaf run`'s TWO ROADS AN ARGUMENT TAKES ─────────────────────
//
// `codeaf run` answers to one new spelling and one old one: `codeaf run
// <program>` runs a saved program out of the registry, and `codeaf run
// <plan.json>` is the retired spelling of `codeaf plan run` and executes a
// static plan file. Something has to tell them apart, and what it used to be
// was os.Stat — a first positional that EXISTED took the plan road.
//
// That made the meaning of a command a property of the caller's shell. A saved
// program called `formatter` ran `./formatter` as a static plan in any
// directory where a file of that name happened to be sitting, and ran the saved
// program one directory up. The reading is the shape of the word now, and this
// file is that law: the same spellings, read from two directories, mean the
// same two things.

// runRoad is which door a `codeaf run` invocation went through.

// roadTaken runs `codeaf run` and says which road it took, read off TWO signals
// that no single mistake can forge: the rename notice, which only the plan road
// prints, and the sentence each door says at its own first wall — the program
// runner asks for the input it was not given, and the plan runner tries to read
// the file. Both walls are reached before a provider key is wanted, so nothing
// here spends anything.
//
// An invocation that shows one signal and not the other is not classified as
// either road; it fails, because a road told only by its notice is the shape of
// test this file exists to not be.

// every directory but the one where the file was.
//
// The law it pins: a bare word is a saved program's name, whatever is on disk
// beside it, and only an argument a person SPELLED as a path — a separator in
// it, a `./`, `../` or `~` in front, or an extension on the end — is a file.
