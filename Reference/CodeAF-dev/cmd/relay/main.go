// Command relay is the codeaf relay: a blind pipe between a machine that runs
// codeaf and a machine somebody is sitting at.
//
// IT IS A SEPARATE BINARY BECAUSE IT IS A SEPARATE THING. Nothing in it imports
// the session, the surface, or the wire they speak; it cannot open a frame and
// has nothing to open one with. Building it apart from `codeaf` is how that
// stays true — a relay that linked the session package would be one careless
// import away from being able to read what it forwards.
//
// It is also what internal/pair's own tests drive, which is the other reason it
// exists: the end-to-end story — a machine registering, a device pairing, a
// conversation crossing — is tested against this exact service and not against
// a stub of it.
//
//	relay --listen :8787
//
// In front of it in production goes whatever already terminates TLS. The relay
// reads X-Forwarded-For when it is there, so its rate limits count the caller
// and not the load balancer.
