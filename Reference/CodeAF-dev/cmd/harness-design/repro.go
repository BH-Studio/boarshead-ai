// THE REPRODUCTION RIG: the same design stage, run N times, with the refusals
// counted instead of the architecture read.
//
// It exists because of a failure this binary could not see. A person's chat kept
// failing to build a harness on a slow reasoning model, and the rig above was
// green — because the rig was measuring nothing. The shared guide had grown a
// `derivation` key, this file's envelope had not, and `strict` refuses unknown
// fields: every reply the guide asked for was thrown out here as "not the
// envelope". A rig that agrees with the guide by accident is not an instrument.
//
// TWO THINGS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE STAGES ABOVE, and both are about measuring
// the surface that actually ships:
//
//   - THE BELT. `-belt chat` renders the guide against internal/exec/bare's
//     tools — read, bash, edit, write, grep, find, ls — which is what a
//     conversation hands a harness (internal/session's harnessMachinery). The
//     rig's own belt is three tools that cannot fail, which is right for
//     measuring architecture and wrong for reproducing a chat.
//   - THE SAMPLE. One design says nothing: the refusals here are stochastic, and
//     the same goal on the same model lands first try and then burns all three
//     attempts. `-repro N` runs the design stage N times and prints how many
//     attempts each one cost and what refused it, so a change to the guide can be
//     argued from a rate rather than from an anecdote.
//
// Usage:
//
//	OPENROUTER_API_KEY=… go run ./cmd/harness-design -repro 5 -belt chat \
//	  -model deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro \
//	  -goal "research helper: given a topic, fetch 3 sources and summarize with citations"
