// The two duties of PART FOUR are prompt work, and prompt work is only proved by
// a real model reading it. This file is that proof, held as a test so the next
// person changing the reviewer brief can re-run the evidence instead of trusting
// a paragraph in a commit message.
//
// It is OPT-IN — `CODEAF_LIVE_REVIEW=1 go test ./cmd/harness-design -run Live -v`
// — because it spends money and takes a minute, and a suite that reaches the
// network by default is a suite people stop running.
//
// The draft it hands the critic is the one the rig really produced, with both
// defects in it at once: three approach-evaluations collapsed into ONE
// agent.loop, and a verify with nowhere to fail to. Neither is visible to
// Validate and neither is visible to the derivation check — a table drawn over
// these four nodes is true, which is exactly why the duties had to be written.
