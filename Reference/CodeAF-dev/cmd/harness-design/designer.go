// STAGE 1 AND STAGE 1.5: the designer's brief, the critic that reads what it
// wrote, and the loop that holds both to the law.
//
// The whole question this rig asks is whether a model handed a plain goal can
// ARCHITECT a sub-harness — pick a topology, pick a verification rung it can
// actually keep, pick a dynamism budget it actually needs — rather than fill in a
// template somebody else already shaped. The brief that asks that question is no
// longer in this file. It is a document, internal/subharness/prompts/designer.md,
// because it is a META-GUIDE: it teaches a derivation procedure in paragraphs, and
// a paragraph held in a Fprintf loses the shape of its own argument to quoting.
//
// The parts that are DERIVED are still derived — every cap, both ladders and the
// tool belt are read out of internal/subharness and filled into the guide's
// placeholders, and a placeholder nobody filled is a load-time error rather than a
// stray brace in a prompt. A guide that has drifted from the package it describes
// still cannot reach a model.
//
// STAGE 1.5 is the second pass. A first draft is written by a model that has just
// finished reading three thousand words of law and is, predictably, still in the
// mood that produced them: it over-builds, it leaves conditions as sentences that
// cost a model call each, and it draws independent work in a line. So the draft is
// handed back to the same guide wearing PART FOUR — a critic with the guide's own
// steps turned into checklists for SPEED, COST and QUALITY.
//
// THE CRITIC DOES NOT HAND BACK A PAGE. It hands back a PATCH — the ops in
// internal/subharness/ops.go — which is applied to the original parsed harness.
// The reason is measured rather than aesthetic: a critic asked to re-emit four
// thousand bytes retypes them, and a retyped page comes back with "whishpeR.cpp"
// where the draft said whisper.cpp. That is a page made worse by the pass that was
// supposed to improve it, in the one place nobody reviewed. A patch cannot make
// that mistake, because text the critic did not name is never in its reply at all.
//
// The delta printed afterwards is the ops list itself. Nothing is diffed and
// nothing is inferred: with a patch, what the critic did and what it says it did
// are the same object.
//
// The other half of holding a model to JSON is [jsonReply]: the reply climbs
// subharness.Salvage's ladder, and a reply that still will not parse buys ONE
// repair turn — its own text and the parser's exact complaint — before a full
// retry is counted. A design refused for typographic quotes is a good design lost
// to punctuation, and the whole guide is re-read to fix a delimiter.
