// STAGE 3'S HALF: what a node MEANS when the thing behind it is a model.
//
// internal/subharness owns the shape of a run and hands each node to an Env
// (exec.go): Loop, Tool, Gate, Check, Cond. This file is one Env, over one
// OpenRouter model and three toy tools, and it exists so a designed harness can
// be RUN rather than only read — a topology nobody executed is a drawing.
//
// TODO-consolidate: internal/subharness/exec_model.go with a ModelExec is where
// this belongs the moment a second caller wants it. It is here, unexported, for
// exactly the reason a dev rig is a dev rig: the prompts below are being tuned
// by the run they are being judged by, and a package is the wrong place to tune
// anything.
