// THE ADAPTIVE RUN, on this rig — `-orchestrate`.
//
// THE QUESTION IT ASKS: a sub-harness is a graph a model DESIGNED, once, before
// any of the work existed. An adaptive run never designs a graph: a planner
// amends a live frontier on every completion, and the graph is whatever that
// leaves behind. So — does planning against results already in hand find
// parallelism the static design could not see, and does it pay for the extra
// planner calls it costs?
//
// The two halves are the contract's own (internal/orchestrate):
//
//	PLANNER   internal/orchestrate/prompt.md + this rig's chat client. Called
//	          once at the start and once per node completion; answers with an
//	          Amendment, salvaged and strictly decoded exactly as the designer's
//	          envelope is.
//	EXECUTOR  one agent turn per node: the run's goal, the node's own goal, the
//	          digests of the ids it needs. It writes its artifact and then its
//	          own DIGEST, which is the only part anything else in the run sees.
//
// THE DRIVER IS LOCAL AND SAYS SO. internal/orchestrate is a contract skeleton
// at this commit — Orchestrator has a Snapshot and no Run — so the scheduler
// below is written to the contract's stated semantics rather than imported:
// no wave barriers, a node launches the instant its needs are all Done, the
// planner is called on every completion and execution NEVER waits for it,
// amendments touch pending nodes only, one fuel tank meters every model call
// including the planner's. When Run lands, this file is what should be deleted
// rather than the thing that taught it something.
//
// Two things this rig does not exercise, said here rather than left to be
// noticed: STEERING is always empty (nobody is at the keyboard, so law 8 is
// untested), and `worktree: true` is recorded and reported and
// nothing isolates anything — the worktree path comes from the session
// (Config.WorktreePath) and this rig has no session; the goals it is validated
// against write no code, so the gap costs nothing here and would cost
// everything in the room.
