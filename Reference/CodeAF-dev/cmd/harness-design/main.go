// Command harness-design is a development rig, not a shipped surface.
//
// THE QUESTION IT ASKS: handed a plain goal and nothing else, can a MODEL
// architect a good sub-harness — and does the harness it wrote produce a good
// answer when it is actually run?
//
// That question is why nothing here is hand-written. A fixture somebody typed
// proves the runner works, which internal/subharness already proves in its own
// tests; what it cannot prove is that the DESIGN half is reachable by a model
// from words a person would say. So the rig has four stages and no shortcuts
// between them:
//
//	STAGE 1    DESIGN  the meta-guide (internal/subharness/prompts/designer.md,
//	                   rendered by designer.go) + the goal → a harness page, its
//	                   cues and its justification. Salvaged, decoded and validated
//	                   by internal/subharness, repaired once, then retried with
//	                   the error fed back.
//	STAGE 1.5  REVIEW  the same guide wearing PART FOUR reads the draft as a
//	                   critic — SPEED, COST, QUALITY — and hands back a PATCH.
//	                   The ops are applied to the draft this rig already parsed,
//	                   so the critic never retypes what it is not changing, and
//	                   the delta printed is the patch itself.
//	STAGE 2    PRINT   the page, the justification, and the CARD — the rendering
//	                   a person actually approves.
//	STAGE 3    RUN     the page executed against a model-backed Env
//	                   (execmodel.go), with the full trace and every step's whole
//	                   output printed, and the trace saved under
//	                   harnesses/<name>/run/<ts>.json.
//
// AND A SECOND RIG BEHIND THE SAME BINARY. `-orchestrate` runs none of the
// above: it asks the opposite question — what if nobody designs a graph at all,
// and a planner amends a live frontier on every completion? That is
// internal/orchestrate, and orchestrate.go is the whole of it. The two share
// this file's transport, salvage ladder and printing, and nothing else.
//
// Usage:
//
//	OPENROUTER_API_KEY=… go run ./cmd/harness-design -goal all
//	OPENROUTER_API_KEY=… go run ./cmd/harness-design -goal hard
//	OPENROUTER_API_KEY=… go run ./cmd/harness-design -goal "your own sentence"
//	                     -model deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash -design-only -review=false
//	OPENROUTER_API_KEY=… go run ./cmd/harness-design -orchestrate -goal all -fuel 1.50
//	OPENROUTER_API_KEY=… go run ./cmd/harness-design -repro 5 -belt chat
//	                     -model deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro -goal "…"
//
// AND A THIRD, WHICH IS AN INSTRUMENT RATHER THAN A QUESTION. `-repro N` runs
// stage 1 N times and tallies what refused it — see repro.go, and the reason it
// had to exist.
