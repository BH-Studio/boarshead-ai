// codeaf-replay judges a chooser by REGRET ON TEN DAYS OF LOG rather than by a
// screenshot.
//
// IT EXISTS BECAUSE WE WERE TUNING A BANDIT BY ANECDOTE. Every change to the
// machine chooser in the week to 2026-09-11 — #850, #853, #873 and two lanes
// still in flight — was argued from one person's screenshot and a ten-row grep,
// and every one of them moved a number nobody then measured. The model-call log
// already holds about a thousand finished requests a day: which machine was
// asked for, which one answered, how long its first token took, how fast it
// wrote, whether it refused, and what the call was for. That is a bandit replay
// dataset, and this is the instrument that reads it as one.
//
// WHAT IT DOES, in one paragraph. It walks the log in time order. Every finished
// request becomes a question — "on this model, at this moment, for this role,
// which machine would you have demanded?" — put to each candidate policy, whose
// beliefs have been fed exactly the sightings and refusals that had arrived by
// then and not one that had not. The answer is priced against what that machine
// measurably did around that moment (world.go), the best machine available is
// priced the same way, and the difference is the regret. The table it prints is
// per role class, because a second of a watched answer and a second of an
// unattended errand are not the same second.
//
// IT IS A DEVELOPER'S BINARY AND NEVER A VERB ON codeaf, for the reason
// cmd/codeaf-census and cmd/codeaf-changes are: the shipped binary is on a
// checked-in byte budget (SIZE-BUDGET) and a measuring tool must not spend the
// product's weight.
//
// Usage:
//
//	codeaf-replay [flags]
//
//	  -log PATH         the model-call log (default: this machine's own)
//	  -sightings PATH   the lane observation journal (default: beside the belief file)
//	  -since DATE       ignore rows before this RFC3339 prefix
//	  -window D         how far either side of a request a machine's own answers
//	                    are read for what it was doing then (default 15m)
//	  -min N            the fewest machines a model needs before its requests are
//	                    scored at all (default 2 — nothing to choose between)
//	  -incidents N      how many of the worst moments to show every candidate at
//	  -out PATH         write the report to a file instead of stdout
