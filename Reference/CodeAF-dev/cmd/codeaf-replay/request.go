//
// THE ROW DOES NOT CARRY ONE, AND THAT IS THE SEAM THIS FUNCTION STANDS IN FOR.
// internal/calllog records a `tag` — the call site's own word for the errand —
// and internal/lane's chooser is steered by a [lane.Role], and the two
// vocabularies are joined nowhere a reader of the file can reach. So the join is
// made here, by one rule and one small table, and it is the first thing to
// delete when the role reaches the row (#928, which carries the acceptance).
//
// THE RULE IS THAT AN ERRAND'S TAG IS ALREADY ITS ROLE. Every side call of a
// turn is tagged with its own role word — internal/session's auxiliary.go hands
// `callPurpose(role)` to the one door, which spells it onto the request
// (clientdoor.go), so three records of one call agree about what to call it —
// which resolves `judge`, `memory`, `design`, `auxiliary`, `recall`, `tool`,
// `probe` and `standing` with no table at all. What is left is the handful of
// tags that name a CALL SITE
// rather than a role, and each of those is one row of data below with the file
// that sets it.
//
// A TAG NOBODY HAS WRITTEN DOWN IS [lane.RoleUnknown], which is the conservative
// reading and not a gap: a call that claims to have a person waiting when it
// does not buys speed with somebody's money, so an unrecognised errand is priced
// as the background errand it almost certainly is.

	// nobody can enumerate, and reading only up to the colon is what keeps it

// `callPurpose(role)` — every [roles.Role] constant there is. A word missing
