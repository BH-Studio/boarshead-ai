// ── THE TWO NUMBERS THIS PROGRAM IS NOT ALLOWED TO CHOOSE ───────────────────
//
// Two candidates need a constant each — how fast a picture should forget, and
// how sure a filter may become — and a constant chosen here would be exactly the
// band-aid this instrument exists to stop other people shipping. So both are
// MEASURED FROM THE SAME LOG being replayed, by the two paragraphs below, and
// both are printed in the report beside the table they produced.

// changeHalfLife is how long one measurement of a machine keeps half of what it
// says.
//
// IT IS THE LOG'S OWN CHANGE-POINT RATE, read as a variogram. Two answers from
// one machine a few seconds apart write at nearly the same rate; two a day apart
// are unrelated, and the difference between them is the whole spread of that
// machine's behaviour. So the mean gap between two answers rises with the lag
// between them and then flattens, and the lag at which it has risen HALF the way
// to flat is the moment a measurement has told you half of what it will ever
// tell you. That is a half-life in the only sense this program needs one, and it
// is measured rather than picked.
//
// It is read on the WRITING RATE and not on the first token, deliberately: a
// first-token wait carries the length of the prompt behind it, so two of them
// differ for a reason that is not the machine changing, and the quantity whose
// regime shifts is the one the 2026-09-11 ninefold collapse moved.

// measurement lands on.
//
// BOTH ENDS ARE TIED TO SOMETHING RATHER THAN CHOSEN. The bottom rung is half a
// minute because a shorter one reads the same answer twice — a model call takes
// tens of seconds, so two draws closer together than that are usually one hedge
// or one retry, and their agreement is a fact about our own fan-out and not
// about how fast a machine drifts. The top is the horizon past which this
// instrument stops believing evidence at all — `stopBelieving`, which is
// `forgotten × lane.HalfLife` and the tree's own hundred minutes — with one
// doubling of headroom, so the ladder can see the variogram flatten rather than
