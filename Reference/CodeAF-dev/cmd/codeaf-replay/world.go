// ── WHAT A MACHINE WAS DOING AT A MOMENT ────────────────────────────────────
//
// A replay's whole difficulty is the counterfactual: the log says what the
// machine we ASKED did, and a candidate policy wants to be scored on a machine
// we did not ask. There is exactly one honest source for that, and it is the
// same file — the other requests, on the same model, to that machine, around
// that moment. Ten days of this log carry between two and twenty-six machines
// per model and about a thousand finished requests a day, so for most requests
// there really is an answer from most of the alternatives within a quarter of an
// hour either side.
//
// THE WINDOW IS THE ESTIMATOR AND IT IS REPORTED. Nothing here pretends the
// counterfactual is observed. What is claimed is narrower and checkable: a
// machine's answers a few minutes either side of a moment are the best available
// account of what it would have done AT that moment, and the report says how
// good that account is by scoring the machine we DID ask both ways — from its
// own row, and from the window — and printing the disagreement (report.go's
// calibration line).

// draw is one measured answer from one machine: what it did, and whether it did
// it at all.
type draw struct {
	at time.Time
	// id is the attempt this draw came from, and it is here for ONE reason: a
	// machine must never be priced using the very answer being scored. The row
	// that served a request sits inside that request's own window, so leaving it
	// in prices the machine that answered on its own worst moment while every
	// alternative is priced on moments that have nothing to do with it — a bias
	// against whatever actually happened, which is exactly the finding this
	// instrument would then be manufacturing.
	id string
	// ttft is the wait before the first token in milliseconds and rate the
	// output tokens a second over the writing window. Both are zero on a draw
	// that measured neither — a refusal, or an answer too short to rate.

	// refused is a machine that did not answer: a paced pool, an account 404, an
	// upstream refusal inside an opened 200. It is the AVAILABILITY axis, kept
	// apart from speed for the reason internal/lane keeps it apart — a pool that
	// is full now is usually fine in five minutes, and a machine that writes at
	// two tokens a second is not.

	// censored is an answer this build cut off rather than one the machine
	// finished: a hedge's losing arm, a stream the guard ended, a caller that

	// as evidence of how fast the machine was writing and as no evidence at all
