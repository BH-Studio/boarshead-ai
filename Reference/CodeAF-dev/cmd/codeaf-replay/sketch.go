// ── A PICTURE THAT FORGETS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The quantile candidate needs the SHAPE of what a machine has been doing and
// needs it to forget at the rate the world changes. Two small types do the whole
// of that: a decayed sample, and a decayed count.

// forgotten is how many half-lives a measurement is kept for. It is not a
// capacity anybody chose: after ten half-lives an observation carries about one
// thousandth of the weight of a fresh one (2⁻¹⁰ ≈ 1/1024), which cannot move any
// quantile that has a hundred fresher observations beside it. Keeping it longer
// is memory spent on arithmetic that rounds away.
const forgotten = 10

// sketch is an exponentially decayed picture of one quantity.
//
// IT KEEPS THE OBSERVATIONS AND NOT A HISTOGRAM, which is the cheaper choice
// here and the more honest one: a histogram needs a bin width, a bin width is a
// resolution at which two different measurements are declared the same, and
// nothing in this log says what that resolution should be. Ten half-lives of
// observations is a few hundred numbers per machine, and a weighted quantile
// over them is exact.

//
// The weight is 2^(−age/halfLife) — the same exponential forgetting
// internal/lane's own beliefs age by — so an observation from one half-life ago
// counts half, and one from an hour ago on a ten-minute half-life counts about a
// sixty-fourth. It answers zero when nothing is left, which the caller reads as
