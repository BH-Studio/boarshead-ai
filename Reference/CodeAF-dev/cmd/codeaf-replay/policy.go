// ── THE FOUR CANDIDATES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A policy is a thing that is TAUGHT in time order and then ASKED. That is the
// whole interface, and it is the whole interface on purpose: a candidate that
// needed a sixth method would be a candidate this instrument could not compare
// with the one that is shipped, which is the only comparison anybody wants.
//
// The three teaching methods are internal/lane's own three — a timed answer, an
// answer's usability, a published row — so the chooser that IS shipped is a
// candidate here with no adapter at all, and a candidate written next week is
// taught exactly what the live ledger is taught and not a fact more.

// Policy is one candidate chooser, judged offline.

	// Name is what it is called in the table.
	Name() string
	// Saw folds in one timed answer, as the ledger's [lane.Ledger.Note] does,
	// and says which class of call measured it.
	//
	// THE CLASS IS OFFERED TO EVERY CANDIDATE AND THE SHIPPED ONE THROWS IT
	// AWAY, which is itself one of the questions being asked here:
	// internal/lane's ledger keys a belief on (model, machine) and on nothing
	// else, so a first token measured behind a two-hundred-message turn and one
	// measured behind a two-message errand are folded into the same posterior.
	Saw(lane.Sighting, string)
	// Judged folds in whether an answer could be used, or whether the machine
	// answered at all ([lane.Ledger.NoteOutcome]).

	// [lane.Ledger.Prime] does.

	// when nothing has been measured.

// here would be a second chooser to keep in step with the first, and the first
// time they drifted this instrument would be measuring the wrong one.
//
// ONE REGISTRY MEANS ONE PASS AT A TIME. [lane.Default] is the process's own set
// and there is no exported way to build a second, so each candidate is
// constructed immediately before its own walk of the log and the walks are
// sequential. That is not a limitation worth an export: the log is replayed

// answers from one machine the filter is very sure where that machine's median
// is. The world is not that stable: a machine that has written at ninety tokens
// a second all afternoon can collapse to two, and a filter with no process noise
// needs many surprising answers to be talked out of a median it has spent an
// hour becoming certain of. Process noise is the statement that the SUBJECT
// moves between observations as well as the measurement being noisy, and the
// smallest honest form of it is a floor: however much has been seen, never claim
// to know this machine's median better than the machine's own day-to-day
// movement (halflife.go's measured figure).
//
// IT IS A WRAPPER AND NOT A PATCH TO internal/lane, deliberately. The floor is a
// question this instrument is asking, not an answer it is shipping; the wrapper
// lets the question be asked of the real chooser with nothing in the product
// changed, and the report says what it would take to ship the answer.
//
// It embeds both seams the chooser reads a ledger through — [lane.Ledger] and
// [lane.Hierarchy] — because choose.go asks for the second by type assertion,
// and a wrapper that satisfied only the first would quietly take the change
// points away from the very candidate that is about to be judged on them.

// a spread in what this build was asking rather than in what the machine was
// doing, and a floor derived from it would be a floor on our own prompts. Both
// posteriors live in the log domain, so the figure is in the right units for
// both; what it is NOT is separately derived for the first-token axis, and the
// consequence belongs beside the finding — `current+Q`'s result is a result

// of a mean; this holds the DISTRIBUTION. The difference is the whole of what a
// tail policy is: a machine that answers in a second half the time and in a
// minute the other half has a median nothing is unsure about, and a person who
// waited the minute did not experience the second. internal/lane already knows
// this and carries [lane.Belief.Spread] beside its posterior for it; the
// question this candidate asks is whether keeping the shape outright, and
// reading it where the role actually pays, beats a median widened by a measured
// dispersion.
//
// IT IS KEYED ON THE ROLE CLASS because the two classes ask different questions

// under one is not evidence about the other.
