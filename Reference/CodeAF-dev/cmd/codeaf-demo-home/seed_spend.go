// seed_spend.go is the usage ledger: what this machine spent, by day, by model,

//
// Every line goes through [session.RecordUsage], which is the same door the
// engine writes through, and the ids on it JOIN — a line about a conversation
// names a conversation on the disk, a line about a piece of work names a row in
// that project's index, a line about a standing order names an item in the
// standing store. That is what the spend page's `what it was for` column reads,
// and a ledger of orphan ids would draw rows a person cannot follow anywhere.
//
// A LINE THAT SPENT NOTHING IS NOT WRITTEN — the ledger's own law, kept by its
// writer — so nothing here is priced at zero.

// five-figure call counts, token volumes that need more than one unit, money in
// the thousands. Those are the readings a heavy user meets on their FIRST look
// at this page, and `make demo-home` exists so that somebody can see a page full
// before they ship it.
//
// THE THREE ARE CLOSE ON PURPOSE. The swarm split its work across them, so their

// has to be read digit by digit, and therefore the one that proves the figures
// are lined up to be read that way.
