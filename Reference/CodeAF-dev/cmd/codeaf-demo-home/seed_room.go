package main

// seed_room.go is the WORK ONE CONVERSATION HAS OUT: the task graph it
// checkpointed, the journal each node wrote, and the background jobs it started.
//
// WHY IT IS HERE AT ALL. Three of v3's surfaces had no frame in the polish
// audit, because nothing in this fixture put anything on them: the jobs section
// in the home column, a job's own page, and a task ROOM. Each of them is drawn
// from a conversation's own record rather than from the project index the rest
// of this program writes, so a demo home with twelve conversations and ten
// pieces of landed work still opened every one of them empty.
//
// ── WHAT THE PRODUCT CAN AND CANNOT KEEP ────────────────────────────────────
//
// EXECUTION DOES NOT SURVIVE THE PROCESS, AND THAT IS A LAW RATHER THAN A GAP.
// A background job is a child of the codeaf that forked it and dies with it
// (internal/session's jobrow.go); a task node names a worker in a working copy,
// and the moment the process ends there is nobody in it. So the two files that
// keep this work — the session folder's tasks.json — are read back with that
// applied: a node the checkpoint calls RUNNING comes back queued and paused
// (task_store.go's [interrupt]), and a job's row comes back STOPPED
// ([runRowNotice]).
//
// THEREFORE THIS SEEDS NO RUNNING JOB AND NO RUNNING NODE, because there is no
// such record to write. A file claiming either would be a fixture faking a shape
// the product does not produce, and every frame captured on it would be a frame
// of something that cannot happen. What it seeds instead is every state that IS
// keepable, including the two the audit most wanted and the fixture had none of:
// work parked on a person ([session.TaskUnverified] — "needs your look") and
// work waiting behind it.
//
// AND NOTHING HERE MAY RE-ENTER THE FRONTIER. A resumed session runs its queued
// work (task_store.go's [Agent.recoverTasks] turns the frontier at the end of
// recovery), so a fixture that seeded a bare queued node would spend real money
// on invented work the first time somebody opened the demo. Every queued node
// below waits on the unverified one, directly or through another queued node,
// and an unverified prerequisite parks its dependants until a PERSON resolves it
// (task_run.go's [TaskGraph.readinessLocked]). That is what makes this fixture
// safe to open, and it is checked by the test beside this program.
//
// ── THE ONE SHAPE THIS FILE SPELLS FOR ITSELF ───────────────────────────────
//
// The checkpoint's records are internal/session's `taskRecord`, `runRecord` and
// `taskDocument`, and all three are unexported: there is no seam for "write me a
// graph that already happened", exactly as there is none for a conversation that
// already happened (seed_talk.go's [journalLine] states the same bargain). So
// the fields are spelled here with their own json tags — and every ENUM in them
// is asked for by name from internal/session, so a renamed state or kind breaks
// this build rather than this fixture. The test beside this program builds a
// real [session.Agent] on the seeded folder and reads the whole graph back off
// its own roster lane, which is the reader the surface uses.
