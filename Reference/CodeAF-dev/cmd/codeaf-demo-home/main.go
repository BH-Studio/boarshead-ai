package main

// codeaf-demo-home builds a DEMO HOME: a throwaway state directory with
// something on every one of v3's places, so the surface can be looked at full
// rather than empty.
//
// WHY IT IS NOT A FIXTURE FOR TESTS AND NOT A SEED FOR A REAL MACHINE. The
// owner opened the standing page, the memory page and the spend page on their
// own machine and saw nothing, because on their machine those stores are new
// and empty — which is the emptiness law working exactly as designed. The
// answer is not to write invented standing orders, invented memories and
// invented spending into ~/.codeaf, which would make a person's own record a
// lie; it is a SECOND home, somewhere else, that the surface can be pointed at.
// So this program never touches the real state root: it writes one directory,
// the one it was given, and the launcher hands that directory to the binary as
// HOME.
//
// WHY IT IS A SEPARATE BINARY. cmd/codeaf has a clean place for a hidden verb —
// `engine` and `tick` both live there — but the seeding below is several hundred
// lines and the shipped binary is on a checked-in byte budget (SIZE-BUDGET,
// PERF.md). A developer target must not spend the product's weight, so this is
// its own main package and `bin/codeaf` does not change by a byte.
//
// EVERYTHING IS WRITTEN THROUGH THE ENGINE'S OWN WRITERS — session.SaveMeta,
// session.RecordUsage, session.RecordArtifact, standing.Store, store.Store — so
// what the surface reads back is what the product itself produces. The one
// exception is stated where it is made ([writeTranscript]).

  codeaf-demo-home [--into dir] [--keep] [--launch path/to/codeaf]

  --into    where to build it; a fresh temporary directory when not given
  --keep    reuse a directory that already holds a demo home rather than refusing
            to write over it, so a second launch sees what the first one left
  --launch  run that binary against the demo home, with HOME pointed at it and a
            presence heartbeat running beside it, and return when it exits

It writes inside --into and nowhere else. The real state root (~/.codeaf) is
never opened.
`

// demoDir resolves where to build, and reports whether it needs building.
//
// A DIRECTORY THAT ALREADY HOLDS ONE IS REFUSED WITHOUT --keep. The whole point
// of this program is that it is safe to run, and the way it could stop being
// safe is somebody typing --into over a directory that is not a demo home at
// all. So an existing directory is only accepted when it is empty, or when the
// caller says --keep and the directory looks like something this program wrote.
// THE DIRECTORY IS RESOLVED THROUGH ITS SYMLINKS BEFORE ANYTHING IS WRITTEN IN
// IT, and on a Mac that is not a nicety: `/tmp` is a symlink to `/private/tmp`,
// os.MkdirTemp hands back the `/tmp` spelling, and a codeaf launched in the
// fixture resolves its own working directory to the `/private/tmp` one. The two
// spellings are two PROJECT BUCKETS for one folder — the fixture's conversations
// under `-tmp-…-codeaf` and the window's own under `-private-tmp-…-codeaf` — so
// home drew the demo project twice, and `enter` on a standing order refused
// because the conversation that asked for it was "elsewhere"
// ([app.homeItemEnter]'s bucket guard). Every path this fixture writes is the
// resolved one, so the fixture and the binary agree about what the folder is
