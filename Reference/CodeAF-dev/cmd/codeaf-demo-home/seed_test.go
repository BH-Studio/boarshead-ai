// The demo home exists to be looked at, which is exactly the kind of thing that
// rots without anybody noticing: a field renamed in internal/session, a schema
// number moved, a reader that stopped believing a shape — and the next person to
// run `make demo-home` sees the empty screens the owner was complaining about in
// the first place, with nothing on the surface saying why.
//
// So this seeds into a temporary directory and reads every place back through
// the SAME readers the surface uses, and insists that each of them has rows. It
// asserts counts and joins rather than words: what the pages say is their own
// tests' business, and a fixture test that pinned prose would fail every time
// somebody improved a sentence.
