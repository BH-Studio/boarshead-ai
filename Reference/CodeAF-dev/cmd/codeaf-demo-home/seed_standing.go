// on disk is the one the ticker and the surface both read: [standing.Store.Create]
// validates it, stamps it and works out when it is next due, and
// [standing.Store.Save] is how the quiet half — what the last check said, how
// many firings in a row came back clean — is written afterwards. The daily
// ledger beside them is [standing.Store.Append], one line per firing and per
// check that cost money, which is where the cost-per-firing on the page is
// summed from.
