// RecordMemoryOutcome — and never through SQL, so the rows land with the real
// schema, the event journal behind them is whole, and a Rebuild would reproduce
// exactly what the page draws. The three shelves are a closed enum (`user`,
// `project`, `env`) and all three are filled, because a shelf with nothing on
// it is not drawn at all.
