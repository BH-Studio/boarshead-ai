// job's own page, and a task room — are the ones the polish audit could not
// capture, because nothing in the fixture put anything on them. So the whole
// point of these tests is that they read the seeding back THROUGH THE ENGINE:
// a real [session.Agent] is built on the seeded conversation's folder and its
// roster lane is subscribed, which is exactly the door internal/tui3 opens and
// exactly what it draws from. A fixture that only its own reader can read is a
// fixture that proves nothing.
