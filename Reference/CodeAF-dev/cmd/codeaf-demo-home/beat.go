// A live conversation says so in a presence.json it rewrites every few seconds,
// and every reader believes that file for three heartbeats and no longer
// (internal/session's taskpresence.go). That rule is what stops a window
// somebody killed from sitting on home forever claiming to be running, and it
// is also why a seeded presence file is worth nothing fifteen seconds after it
// was written. So while the surface is open this restamps the same rows on the
// same cadence a real session does — the rows the seeding wrote, read back off
// the disk and given a fresh instant, never invented here.
