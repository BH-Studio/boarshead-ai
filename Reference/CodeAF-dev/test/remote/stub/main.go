// Command modelstub is a scripted, deterministic stand-in for the model
// endpoint, so that the two-machine harness in internal/e2e/remote_test.go can
// drive a REAL turn without an API key and without a network.
//
// WHY A STUB AND NOT A REAL MODEL. The thing under test is the wire between two
// filesystems, not the model's judgment. A real model would make every scenario
// probabilistic — a path assertion that fails because the model chose to
// paraphrase instead of quoting is a false red — and it would put a bill and a
// credential in front of a test whose whole point is that anybody can run it.
// So this speaks OpenRouter's OpenAI-compatible dialect exactly as
// internal/provider writes and reads it (client.go's `<base>/chat/completions`,
// sse.go's chunk shape, catalog.go's `<base>/models?output_modalities=all`) and
// answers from a script.
//
// THE SCRIPT IS KEYED OFF THE PERSON'S OWN WORDS. Every scenario submits a
// message carrying one of the markers below, and this server answers the way
// that scenario needs — including calling a tool, so the engine machine does
// real work on its own disk and the reply can be checked against it.
//
//	PROBE-ECHO         one reply, no tools: the handshake and one turn
//	PROBE-PWD          calls `bash` with `pwd`, then quotes the answer back
//	PROBE-READ <path>  calls `read` on the path, then quotes the answer back
//	PROBE-SLOW         a reply spread over seconds, for the link that dies
//	PROBE-NOCHANGE <path> replays the completion-check rejection from #1065
//
// QUOTING THE TOOL OUTPUT BACK IS THE WHOLE TRICK. `--once` prints the model's
// reply on stdout and the tool's own output nowhere at all, so a scenario that
// wants to assert on what a tool SAW has to have the reply carry it. A real
// model would summarize; this one echoes verbatim, which is what makes an
// assertion about an absolute path possible at all.
//
// STDERR IS THE LOG. Every request is one line, so `docker logs` on the model
// container answers "did the turn ever reach the model, and what did it ask".
