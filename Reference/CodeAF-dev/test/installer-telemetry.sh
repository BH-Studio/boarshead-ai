# The installer writes the local install marker and prints no telemetry notice:
# the binary shows the notice, quoted byte for byte in docs/TELEMETRY.md and the
# README, before the first session's events are sent. The installer's main body
# downloads a release, so this test never sources it whole: it lifts out the
# marker and PATH functions and runs them against a temporary state root.
# Nothing here opens a socket.
