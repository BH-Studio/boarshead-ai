// Package consent is the price before the purchase.
//
// Every number in this system used to be retrospective. Cost was computed after
// spending, the rail fired after crossing, and the first quantity a user ever
// saw about a fifty-leaf job was a step count emitted well after the planning
// that produced it had been paid for. There was no moment at which a person
// could look at what they had asked for and decline it.
//
// This is that moment, and it is deliberately small: one question, quoting a
// count and a price, with two options, on the last tick at which not starting
// is free — the claim. Below the threshold nothing is asked at all, because a
// resident that asks permission for two dollars of work is not a resident.
//
// It is a package rather than a corner of the chat window because the desk has
// to be reachable from wherever work is admitted. A window-side desk answers
// only for the process holding the terminal; a resident-side orchestrator —
// the August 2026 chat-rebuild audit's 4.6 v2 (no longer in the tree) — admits
// work with no window attached at all,
// and until this moved it had no way to price anything (Part 9.10).
