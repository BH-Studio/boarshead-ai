// Package filedoor is the loopback door: a 127.0.0.1 HTTP listener, owned by
// one chat surface, that turns files on the FAR machine into things this
// machine's own programs can open — a browser tab, cmd+click on an OSC 8 link,
// the platform opener.
//
// ── CAPABILITIES, NOT PATHS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A byte URL is /f/<id> and an interactive-open URL is /o/<id>; their shared id
// maps to a path in a table nobody else can write. The door cannot be asked for an arbitrary path:
// a local process that guesses URLs can reach only what the surface itself
// chose to link, and each id dies with the door. The browse page's token is
// the same idea for the listing side: /browse/ and /api/... require the one
// token minted at Open, so another local user's curl gets 404, never a listing.
//
// A WRONG TOKEN AND AN UNKNOWN ID BOTH ANSWER 404, ALWAYS THE SAME 404. A
// distinct status for "the id is real but your token is wrong" would confirm
// existence to somebody who is guessing, and a door whose refusals are
// informative is a door with a side channel in it.
//
// ── THE TOKEN IS NEVER IN AN ARGV ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// [Door.BrowseURL] is handed to the platform opener, and the platform opener is
// exec: whatever is in that address is in /proc/<pid>/cmdline, which under the
// default hidepid every other account on this machine can read, and after that
// it is in the browser's history and in a Referer header. So the address the
// door hands out CARRIES NO TOKEN AT ALL. It is /enter/<nonce>: a single-use
// name, good once and briefly, that is spent the moment a browser walks it. In
// exchange the door sets the real token as an HttpOnly SameSite=Strict cookie
// and redirects to /browse/, with nothing secret left in the address bar. After
// that the secret lives in exactly two places — this process's memory and one
// browser's cookie jar — and no other account on the machine can read either.
//
// The path lane (/browse/<token>, /api/<token>/ls) still authorises, because a
// person holding the token and curl is the oldest way through this door and the
// simplest way to test it. Where both are offered the cookie wins.
//
// ── THE DOOR SERVES, THE SOURCE DECIDES ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every byte and every listing comes through [Source], which is the engine's
// law speaking (internal/remote's handOver two-roots rule). The door adds no
// judgement of its own about what may be shown: a path the source refuses is a
// sentence passed through verbatim, exactly as the surface passes the engine's
// refusals through today. That is why a refusal leaves here as 502 with the
// sentence as its whole body — the door has nothing to add to it, and rewriting
// somebody else's refusal is how a message stops being true.
//
// ── AND EVERY BYTE LEAVES SANDBOXED ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE FILES ARE NOT OURS. They came off somebody else's disk, quite possibly
// written by a model, and they are served on the same 127.0.0.1 port that holds
// the capability to list that disk and to write to it. A far machine's .html or
// .svg rendered on this origin would be a document executing next to the keys:
// it could read the token out of a referrer, call /api/ls, GET every file it
// found and POST the lot anywhere. So /f/<id> answers under
// `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox`, which drops the response into an opaque
// origin where it is same-origin with nothing, and the kinds a browser actually
// executes are additionally sent as an attachment rather than rendered. What a
// person came to look at — a picture, a log, a PDF — stays inline, because
// viewing is the product.
//
// ── UPLOADS LAND IN attachments/ AND NOWHERE ELSE ───────────────────────────
//
// Dragging a file onto the browse page sends it up the same lane /attach uses,
// and it lands where an attachment lands: the far session's attachments/
// folder. The door never writes an arbitrary remote path — moving a file INTO
// the workspace proper is the conversation's job ("put attachments/x.csv next
// to the others"), because that is a write on somebody's machine and writes
// belong to the lane that already owns consent for them.
