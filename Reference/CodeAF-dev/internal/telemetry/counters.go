// The session counters are the three chokepoints a run passes through — a
// turn sealed, a model call answered, a tool call answered — and the dollar
// figure those model calls spent. They are the numbers [SessionEnded] needs,
// arrived at WITHOUT the binary having to carry its own tally: the wiring
// calls CountTurn, CountModelCall and CountToolCall on the paths the events
// describe, and Snapshot hands the constructor exactly the [SessionStats]
// fields it takes, so nothing between the two adapts anything.
//
// THE COUNTERS COUNT WHETHER OR NOT TELEMETRY IS ENABLED, and they do it by
// never asking. There is no ladder read here, no enabledFor(), no branch on
// the opt-out at all: counting three integers costs a few nanoseconds and
// nothing else, so the decision about whether to SEND them is taken once,
// later, by the event path — where it belongs. A counter that went quiet
// when telemetry was off would make Snapshot lie about a run that DID
// happen, and a counter that asked the ladder on every model call would put
// the opt-out check on the hot path the latency law guards.

// counters is the process's one tally, package-level because the chokepoints
// calling it sit in internal/session and internal/provider, which reach the
// package as a whole rather than through an object a run would have to carry.
// Every field is an atomic int64, which is the whole allocation story: each
// CountX is one Add and one conditional Add, on memory that exists before the
// first session and never grows.

	// every cost a provider reports at six places, and the one rounding —
	// in costToMicro, at the boundary — is the only one there is.

// It builds ONE struct and reads each atomic once; the six numbers are
// therefore not from a single instant, which is fine — a run's last model
// call can land after its last turn sealed, and a snapshot that could not be
// taken mid-run would be a snapshot that could not be taken at all.
//
// The fields SessionEnded fills and Snapshot does not return — Duration,
// StopReason, ExitCode — belong to the run's END, which is the caller's fact:
// elapsed time and exit status live where the process does, and Snapshot
// carries only what the chokepoints counted.
