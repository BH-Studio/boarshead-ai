// Package reflex is the per-turn tier's client: the small structured calls a
// conversation makes AROUND an exchange rather than in it.
//
// Three calls live here. [Route] runs before the turn — it reads the message
// just typed and the index of what is already remembered, and answers which
// remembered lines this turn actually needs. [Extract] runs after it — it reads
// the exchange and answers whether anything in it is worth keeping. [Decide]
// settles what to do with something worth keeping when the store already holds
// something near it.
//
// They share one shape and one law:
//
//   - THE MODEL IS A REFLEX, NOT A THINKER, AND THE PROMPT IS WHERE THAT IS
//     SAID. Every call goes out with a small prompt on [roles.RoleReflex] — its
//     own tier ([roles.TierReflex]) precisely because a call made twice per turn
//     is a different economy from one made once a session. Nothing here asks the
//     model to reason; it sorts, it names, and it answers in a few words of
//     JSON. It used to say so on the WIRE as well, with a 200-token ceiling and
//     a required reasoning disable; neither travels now, because how deeply
//     somebody else's model thinks is not this package's to decide. An effort
//     already carried by the caller or the configured model remains intact;
//     this helper adds none.
//
//   - REFLEX NEVER BREAKS A TURN. A model that answers with prose, with a code
//     fence, or with an enum this package has never heard of costs ONE repair
//     retry. A model that spends its ceiling and answers nothing gets ONE larger
//     retry, then the session's low-tier fallback. After that every failure is a
//     zero result and [ErrReflexFailed]. Every caller treats that as a no-op:
//     the turn happens exactly as it would have if this package did not exist.
//     That is why the failure is a typed error rather than a returned
//     half-answer — there is no such thing as a partly-routed turn.
//
// The package is the client only. It makes no decision about WHEN a call
// happens, holds no store, and is wired into no loop; the chat integration and
// the memory store are separate slices that build against the types below.
