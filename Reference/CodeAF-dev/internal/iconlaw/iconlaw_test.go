// Package iconlaw is THE ICON LAW, and it is a package of nothing but the law.
//
// One vocabulary draws every mark a person sees in this product — the task
// states, the action families in a step gutter, the file kinds on a chip, the
// chrome — and it lives in internal/tui2/tokens with three spellings per slot:
// the Font Awesome 4 icon a patched font draws, the geometric floor every
// terminal draws, and the one ASCII character a screen reader can name.
// docs/design/icons/DESIGN.md is the law's own page; what follows is the part a
// build can fail on.
//
// IT LIVES IN ITS OWN PACKAGE BECAUSE IT IS NOT ONE SURFACE'S LAW. It landed as
// internal/tui3's own test and covered internal/tui3 only, which left the older
// window and the resident free to spell marks for themselves — and they did:
// v1 drew its own dotted circle for work waiting on a sibling, its own cross
// for failure, and its own flag for work waiting on a person, which is the
// character the vocabulary keeps for the OTHER kind of waiting. One list of
// packages here is how a fourth surface joins the law by being added to it,
// rather than by somebody remembering to copy a test.

//
// internal/tui2 is deliberately NOT here. It holds the vocabulary itself, where
// the private-use codepoints are the table rather than a spelling of it, and its
// remaining component packages are swept by tokens' own
// TestConsumersDrawFromTheTable, whose list grows the same way this one does.
//
// internal/head and internal/resident are here even though the sweep found
// almost nothing in them, which is the point of a gate rather than an audit:
// the resident writes the lines a person reads on the board and in a brief, and
// nothing but this test stands between it and its own private spelling of the

// would be a gate people learn to ignore.
