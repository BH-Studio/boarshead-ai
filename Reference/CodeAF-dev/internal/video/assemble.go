// assemble.go is the three operations that change files: a frame saved out of a
// clip, several clips joined into one, and a score laid under a cut.
//
// Every one of them is built in two halves — a PLAN, which is a pure function
// from measured facts to an argument list, and a run of that plan. The split is
// not tidiness. An ffmpeg filter graph is the part that is easy to get subtly
// wrong and impossible to eyeball in a passing test, so the graph is data that a
// test reads directly: `TestAJoinMapsEveryClipsAudio` asserts on the plan for
// twelve clips without encoding a single frame, and the encode tests then prove
// the plan is one ffmpeg accepts.

// past the end and decodes nothing, and seeking to length-minus-a-bit needs the
// frame rate to know what "a bit" is. ffmpeg can seek relative to the end, so
// this is the fact and not the estimate.
