// Package video is the LOCAL half of codeaf's video work: the things done to
// files that already exist, on this machine, with ffmpeg — as against the
// renders bought from a provider a clip at a time
// (internal/session/tools_video.go).
//
// It exists because the two halves are not the same kind of work and were being
// treated as one. A render is minutes of somebody else's GPU, costs real money,
// and produces exactly one short clip because that is what the endpoints do. But
// a *film* is several of those clips joined, with a frame carried from each one
// into the next so the shots connect, and a score laid underneath — and every
// one of those four operations is a local, free, deterministic thing that ffmpeg
// has done for twenty years.
//
// Until this package, codeaf did them by writing ffmpeg command lines into the
// shell, and the manual said so in as many words. That has two costs and the
// second one is the expensive one:
//
//   - It asks a language model to write a filter graph, which is a dialect it
//     knows unevenly and cannot test before running.
//   - IT DROPS THE SOUND. The natural way to write a join — `concat` on the
//     video streams, or an `xfade` between them — carries the first input's
//     audio and silently discards every other input's. The result plays, looks
//     right, and goes quiet after the first clip. Nothing errors, nothing warns,
//     and it is not visible in anything but the ear. The manual grew a whole
//     section about the defect ("Why is a stitched video incoherent, or silent
//     after the first clip?") because it kept happening.
//
// So the audio is carried BY CONSTRUCTION here, not by remembering: [Join]
// probes every clip, gives the silent ones a generated silence track of their
// own measured length, and concatenates N video streams with N audio streams. A
// join cannot come out silent, because there is no code path in which the audio
// is not mapped.
//
// The library is deliberately free of the session: it takes paths and returns
// facts and errors, so the belt verb (internal/session/tools_editvideo.go) is a
// thin wire over it and the same operations are available to anything else that
// grows a need for them.
