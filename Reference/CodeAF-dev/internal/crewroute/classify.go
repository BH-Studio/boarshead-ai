// WHAT KIND OF WORK A TASK IS, READ OFF ITS OWN WORDS.
//
// The router routes on a task's CLASS and on nothing finer, by design
// (docs/design/model-pool/pareto-crewing.pdf): the class decides the crew. A
// narrow fix goes to the cheapest qualified crew, and open-ended work (a
// feature, a refactor, docs, a design) gets a strong checker behind it. So the
// question this file answers is the only one the router asks of the text:
// which of the two is this?
//
// ── THE SIGNALS ──
//
// It is rules, not a model, and every rule is written down here so a person
// asking "why did it call my task a bugfix" is answered by reading them:
//
//   - LABELS weigh most. An issue labelled `bug` or `enhancement` is a person
//     telling us the answer.
//   - THE TITLE weighs more than the body. A conventional-commit prefix
//     (`fix:`, `feat:`, `refactor:`), a `[bug]` tag or a leading verb
//     (`add`, `support`, `document`) is the author classifying their own work.
//   - THE BODY adds the rest: a stack trace, an exception's name, "crashes",
//     "regression", "steps to reproduce" lean narrow; "feature request",
//     "would be great", "consider adding", "refactor" lean open-ended.
//
// A harness's own wrapper around an issue — "Implement issue #12: …" and the
// standing instruction to keep the test suite green that follows every task
// it hands out — is read past, because it is the same sentence on every task
// and a signal that fires on everything tells the router nothing.
//
// ── UNCERTAIN IS OPEN-ENDED ──
//
// When the signals do not clearly favour one class, the answer is
// [OpenEnded], and that is the safe side on purpose: calling a narrow fix
// open-ended costs a strong checker it did not need — cents — while calling
// open-ended work a narrow fix sends it to a crew without the checker that
// work needs. The two mistakes are not the same size, so the tie does not go
// to the cheaper one.

// Class is the kind of work a task is. It is a string because it is written
// into the router's event log and onto a task's card, and a script reading
// either reads the word.
