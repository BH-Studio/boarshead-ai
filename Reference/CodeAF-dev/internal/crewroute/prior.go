// WHAT A SEAT IS WORTH, BEFORE THIS INSTALL HAS RUN ANYTHING.
//
// The router needs, for every class of work, every seat and every model it
// might sit there, two numbers: how much that model in that seat adds to the
// work's quality, and what it costs. Both are read off the model's own
// catalog row through fitted weights (prior.json, embedded). No model has a
// row of its own there: every model, whoever makes it, is scored the same way.
//
//  1. ABILITY FROM METADATA. A model's ability is a latent number predicted
//     from the fields its catalog row carries. The weights are a joint
//     Gaussian over the ability and those fields ([weights.Mean],
//     [weights.Cov]); a row is scored by conditioning on the fields it HAS,
//     and a field it lacks is integrated out, which widens the variance.
//     A row that publishes any index — the intelligence, coding or agentic
//     index, or the design-arena Elo ([weights.IndexFeatures]) — is scored
//     from those indexes alone: nothing else on the row raises or lowers it,
//     so a model at least as good on every index and no dearer is never
//     scored below another. A row that publishes none is scored from its
//     context length, release date and licence ([weights.BaseFeatures]), and
//     its product family ([familyOf]) moves the mean by the family's fitted
//     offset. Price is never read as ability: it is the cost.
//
//  2. ABILITY TO A SEAT. The ability is mapped to an expected solve rate u in
//     (0, 1) ([weights.Ability]), and each (class, seat) reads u through its
//     own linear link: quality = level + slope·(u − u_ref), on the 0–10 crew
//     scale ([seatLink]). The slope is what the seat pays for ability in that
//     class of work; its standard deviation is how sure the fit is of it.
//     A seat is weighed at the ability's mean less [riskKappa] of its
//     standard deviation, so a row the weights know less about is weighed
//     below one they know well at the same mean.
//
//  3. THIS INSTALL'S OUTCOMES. What a person kept or redid, per class, seat
//     and model, moves the quality by a bounded amount ([Request.Learned]).
//
// A model the weights cannot say enough about — its variance barely below the
// prior's, because its row carries almost nothing ([weights.EvidenceMaxRatio])
// — sits no seat unless a person pins it. Nor does a model whose ability's
// upper bound falls under the weakest ability the weights credit with doing
// the work ([weights.UFloor]).
//
// The cost of a seat is the seat's token shape — how much it reads fresh, how
// much it reads back from a warm cache, how much it writes on an ordinary task
// — priced at the route's published per-token prices and scaled per class and
// seat ([weights.CostScale]).
