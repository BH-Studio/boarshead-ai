// Package crewroute picks the crew for one task: which model sits the worker,
// the planner and the checker seat, on which provider's route, for this piece
// of work and nothing longer.
//
// ── THE ONE SENTENCE IT IMPLEMENTS ──
//
// The /crew panel says what is allowed (it persists); the words in the ask say
// how hard to try this one task. Nothing else sticks. So there is no preset
// here and no mode: a caller hands over the task, the models the person allows
// on the providers they have connected, the seats they pinned, and at most one
// word of effort, and gets back one crew for this task.
//
// ── WHY IT ROUTES ON THE CLASS OF WORK ──
//
// The design is in docs/design/model-pool/pareto-crewing.pdf. The rule it
// follows: narrow fixes use the cheapest qualified crew, and open-ended work
// gets a stronger checker, the one seat worth paying for there. The policy is
// read off a table ([prior]) rather than written into branches: classify the
// task ([Classify]), then pick each seat to maximise quality minus λ times
// cost.
//
// ── WHAT IT DOES NOT DO ──
//
// It does not escalate on its own. A done-verdict that misses real solves and
// passes failures would make an escalation loop spend on the wrong tasks, so
// [AutoEscalate] is off, and a stronger crew is something a person asks for
// (`redo stronger`).
//
// It is PURE: no disk, no network, no clock. The same request gives the same
// crew, in the same order, every time — which is what lets a decision be
// logged, replayed and argued with. A decision costs well under a millisecond.
