// This machine's own long-term key, and where it is kept.
//
// ONE KEY PER MACHINE, USED FOR THREE THINGS: the name the relay knows this
// machine by is derived from its public half; the Noise handshake that carries
// a conversation is between it and the other end's; and the relay's
// registration challenge is answered with it. Each of the three derives from it
// under its own label, which is what makes one key safe to spend three ways.
//
// A DEVICE IS NOT A PERSON AND NOT AN ACCOUNT. There is no sign-in here, no
// server that knows who anybody is, and nothing to recover if the file is lost —
// a lost key means a device that is no longer paired, which is un-paired from
// the engine machine and paired again. That is a smaller blast radius than an
// account, and it is why there is no account.
