// The two books, and they are deliberately two.
//
// THE ENGINE MACHINE'S BOOK IS THE ONE THAT DECIDES. It lists the devices that
// may open a conversation here, and a device that is not in it is refused no
// matter what it believes about itself. REVOCATION IS ALWAYS THIS MACHINE'S
// DECISION — a surface cannot un-pair itself from here, cannot add itself here,
// and cannot ask this machine to forget somebody else. That is the same law the
// rest of codeaf already keeps about remote surfaces: trust roots on the machine
// that runs the tools.
//
// THE SURFACE'S BOOK IS A MEMORY, NOT A PERMISSION. It records which key each
// machine name belongs to, so that a later connection can be pinned to the key
// this device actually paired with rather than to whatever answers to a name.
// Deleting it costs a person nothing except having to pair again.
