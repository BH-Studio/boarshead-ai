// Which relay this machine uses.
//
// THERE IS NO BUILT-IN DEFAULT, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. The relay service is
// not deployed; a default pointing at an address that does not answer would
// turn "nothing is set up" — which has a next step — into "the network is
// broken", which does not. So an unset relay is its own state with its own
// sentence ([NoRelay]), and the day the service goes live is the day a default
// belongs in this file and not before.
//
// A MACHINE REMEMBERS THE RELAY IT WAS PAIRED THROUGH, so a device that has
// used two of them reaches each machine through the right one without anybody
// having to say which. The environment variable still wins over that, because
// an override that could not override would not be one.
