//
// THE FIRST TIME IT PAIRS AND EVERY TIME AFTER THAT IT JUST OPENS. That is the
// whole shape of the door, and the reason the pairing prompt lives here rather
// than in a separate `codeaf pair` command: a person types the command they
// want to use, and pairing is a question that comes up on the way, once.
//
// EVERYTHING THAT MIGHT ASK A QUESTION HAPPENS BEFORE THE SURFACE TAKES THE
// SCREEN. That is the ssh door's own law (cmd/codeaf's chatv3_host.go) and it
// applies here for the same reason: a code typed into a full-screen surface
// would be a code typed at a frame drawn over the top of it.
