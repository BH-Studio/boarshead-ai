// The introduction: a PAKE over six digits, and two long-term keys carried past
// the relay under it.
//
// WHY A PAKE AND NOT A SHARED SECRET. The relay brokered this meeting, so it is
// exactly the party that could sit in the middle of it. A plain "both ends hash
// the code" scheme would hand a listener a transcript to grind six digits
// against offline, and six digits do not survive that for a second. A PAKE does
// not leak the code to a listener at all: the only way to test a guess is to
// run a whole exchange against the machine that minted it, which counts them
// ([Desk], [CodeAttempts]).
//
// THE PRIMITIVE IS CPace, from filippo.io/cpace, over ristretto255. It is a
// real, reviewed implementation and NOT ONE OF OURS. Nothing in this package
// implements a PAKE, an AEAD, a handshake pattern or a key schedule; the
// primitives are CPace for the introduction and github.com/flynn/noise for
// everything after it, and this file is the wiring between them.
//
// WHAT THE PAKE'S OUTPUT IS USED FOR is one thing only: it is the pre-shared
// key of a Noise NNpsk0 handshake. That is what turns "we agree on a key" into
// a confirmed, authenticated channel — the second message cannot be decrypted
// by anybody who derived a different key, so a wrong code fails as a refused
// handshake and never as a connection that quietly means something else.
