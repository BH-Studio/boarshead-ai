// ONE SENTENCE, NAMING THE THING THAT IS WRONG. Never a stack trace, never a
// hang, and never a sentence that covers two different causes.
//
// This matters more here than almost anywhere else in codeaf, because `--at`
// has four completely different ways to not work and a person cannot tell them
// apart by looking: there is no relay set up; the relay is not answering; the
// machine is not connected to it; this device was never let in. Each one has a
// different next step, and a shrug that covered all four would send somebody
// to check their wifi when the answer was `codeaf serve`.
//
// THE RELAY SERVICE IS NOT DEPLOYED YET, and the first of these is therefore
// the sentence most people will meet. It says what to do about it rather than
// apologising: `--host` over ssh works today and is not going anywhere.
