// `codeaf serve`: the machine that owns the work, holding one outbound
// connection open and answering the devices that arrive on it.
//
// IT LISTENS FOR NOTHING. There is no port, no inbound rule, no certificate and
// no address to tell anybody. The machine walks out to the relay and stays
// there, which is why this works from behind a home router, a corporate
// firewall or a café network with no configuration at all.
//
// EVERY DECISION IS MADE HERE AND NOT AT THE RELAY: whether a pairing code is
// live, whether a device is let in, whether a device is stopped. The relay's
// part is to put two byte streams next to each other.
