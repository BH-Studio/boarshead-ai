// THE MANUAL LAW, ENFORCED FOR THIS PACKAGE'S OWN SENTENCES.
//
// The chat answers questions about codeaf out of the pages in
// internal/manual/chat, and its training data contains nothing about this
// program — so a sentence a person can be shown that is not in a page is a
// sentence the chat will improvise around or deny. Every line below is
// something somebody can read on their screen, quoted here against the corpus
// so that changing one without changing the page fails the build.
//
// The bar is the same one the other gates set: the page must SAY the sentence,
// word for word, not describe it well.
