// `codeaf devices`: what this machine has let in, and how to stop one.
//
// THE LIST IS THE ENGINE MACHINE'S OWN, and so is the stopping. A device cannot
// list itself out of somebody's machine and cannot stop another device; the
// command answers about the machine it is typed on. That is the same law the
// rest of codeaf keeps about remote surfaces — the machine that runs the tools
// is the machine that decides who may run them.
//
// THE EMPTINESS LAW APPLIES: a machine with no devices paired prints one
// sentence saying so, not a heading over an empty table.
