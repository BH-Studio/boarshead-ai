// The pairing code: six digits, shown on the machine that owns the work, typed
// into the machine that wants in.
//
// SIX DIGITS IS THE WHOLE SECURITY BUDGET FOR THE INTRODUCTION, and it is
// enough only because of what surrounds it. The exchange is a PAKE, so a
// listener — including the relay — learns nothing about the code and cannot
// test guesses offline; an attacker gets one online guess per attempt; and the
// machine that minted the code throws it away after [CodeAttempts] wrong ones
// and after [CodeValidFor]. A million codes, five guesses, ten minutes.
//
// IT IS READ OFF ONE SCREEN AND TYPED INTO ANOTHER, sometimes over a phone
// call, so it is shown with a space in the middle — `715 302` — and accepted
// with or without it.
