// Package furrowbin carries furrow inside codeaf and puts it on disk the first
// time anything wants it.
//
// THE RULING THIS PACKAGE EXISTS FOR IS "NO VARIANCE": every codeaf is a
// codeaf with furrow. Before this, furrow was a program the person went and
// installed, so the four workspace verbs — byte-exact forks that carry the
// dirty tree, the sealed timeline, the restore that puts a .env back — were a
// capability some machines had. Half a product is worse than either half: the
// model cannot plan around a verb that exists on the author's laptop and not on
// the reader's, and the pages that described it had to hedge every sentence. So
// the binary rides along, and the only thing that still varies is whether a
// particular folder has been attached with `furrow watch`.
//
// The bytes get here in three moves, and each one is somewhere else:
//
//  1. pin.json, committed, names the release and the sha256 of every
//     platform's artifact. It is the auditable half and the one source of the
//     version.
//  2. `make build` runs cmd/fetch, which downloads that platform's artifact,
//     checks it against the pin, and stages it gzipped into cache/. The
//     artifact is gitignored — six megabytes of binary in git is six megabytes
//     in every clone forever — and a fetch that cannot happen fails the build
//     out loud, naming the command to run, rather than quietly producing an
//     codeaf without furrow.
//  3. This package embeds cache/ and, on first need, writes the binary out
//     under the state root.
//
// [Ensure] is the whole runtime surface, and internal/furrow is its only
// caller. NOTHING ELSE IN THE TREE KNOWS THE BINARY WAS EMBEDDED: the seam
// stays where it was, a caller still asks internal/furrow whether furrow can
// act on a folder, and the answer's new reason for being yes is not the
// caller's business.
