// assertClickableAsk is the whole of 13.3 bug 1's producing half, stated once.
//
// A question the head asks has to be three things at the same time, and before
// this wave it was only ever two of them plus a smuggled copy of the third:
//
//   - a row a person can CLICK — the durable typed options, in order, so a reply
//     of "2" means the second one on every surface;
//   - a block a renderer can DRAW without parsing prose — the question part,
//     saying how it is spelled and whose answer it is;
//   - a line a person can READ — prose, with the choices numbered in it, and no
//     machinery anywhere in it.
//
// The last one is what the old chat reads, so it is asserted as prose AND as
// the absence of a payload: a body that still carried `{"kind":...}` would pass
// every other assertion here and still be the bug.
