// task: one of three verbs, and the only door onto new work.
//
// Three tools used to stand here — spawn, fork, correct — and the difference
// between them was never a difference the person made. "Go and do this", "take
// what we just worked out and go do it", and "that's wrong, do it again" are
// all one intent with different things travelling alongside it: nothing, the
// conversation, or the previous attempt. So they are arguments now, and the
// belt carries one verb for commissioning (the August 2026 chat-simplification
// audit, no longer in the tree, §2.3).
//
// What did NOT survive is the orders array. The chat never splits work: a
// message carrying four asks is one ask that enumerates, and the compiler
// already decomposes better than a tool call can, with the whole message in
// hand. The fan-out cap, the dedupe of repeated orders and the collapse
// arithmetic all die with it; genuinely unrelated asks are two task calls, and
// the turn-level guard below still stops the loop commissioning one twice.
//
// Two guards stay exactly where they were, because both are the last place they
// can still be true: the consequence gate at the journaling door — a reflex
// whose words buy, send, publish or delete beyond the workspace is not a
// reflex — and alreadyCommissioned, which is one turn's memory of what it has
// already turned into work. The third guard, the duplicate-ask check against
// work already waiting in the funnel, has MOVED to the store (admission.go), so
// a headless `codeaf do` is protected by it too.

// task commissions one piece of work. It returns what the loop is allowed to
// say about it and nothing more: a receipt names commands that actually exist.
