// The artifact law's door (12.5.1).
//
// Session bd3c78ed asked for an SVG architecture diagram. The head authored it
// inline as prose; the reply was cut mid-stream at 1,611 characters because the
// answering call ended at exactly 600 completion tokens; the half was journaled
// unmarked as if complete; asked to save and open it, the head offered, then
// discovered it held only the fragment, and stopped. Twelve provider calls,
// ~78k prompt tokens, zero deliverable, zero commands journaled.
//
// Every part of that failure had a cause and only one of them was the cap. The
// head had no way to put anything on disk. "Answer inline" was not the wrong
// choice among several — it was the ONLY route a deliverable had, so the output
// cap and the deliverable were competing for the same budget, and an output cap
// always wins. This file is the other route: anything the person will USE
// outside the conversation is born on disk and referenced by path.
//
// Three properties make it a door rather than a filesystem.
//
//   - The workspace is the default, not a cage. A person who says "save it to
//     /tmp/probe-story" gets /tmp/probe-story; only when they name nowhere does
//     the file land in the workspace. This tool used to refuse every path
//     outright, so the four probes that named a directory each had their
//     deliverable written somewhere else and were then ASKED, afterwards,
//     whether it should be moved — the product knowing it had disobeyed and
//     shipping anyway. A floor may still forbid a place, and when it does the
//     refusal is returned before anything is written, never discovered after.
//   - It revises what it wrote and never clobbers what it did not. A file this
//     conversation put on disk is updated in place, because "make the middle
//     column narrower" is a new version of one artifact and not a second
//     artifact: forking it to `-2` while calling it "the updated file" leaves
//     the person owning two files with no signal which is live. A file the
//     system did not write is left exactly as it is and the new one is minted
//     beside it, with the receipt saying so — overwriting the person's own bytes
//     to repair OUR mistake is still the wrong trade.
//   - What it writes, it can read back. artifact.go's boundary is that the only
//     openable bytes are ones the SYSTEM recorded a path for; a file this head
//     wrote is recorded exactly as firmly as a file a worker wrote, so it joins
//     that set rather than opening a second door beside it. Recording is by
//     absolute path, so a file written outside the workspace is as openable as
//     one written inside it.

	// writeArtifactMaxBytes bounds one document. It is generous by the standards
