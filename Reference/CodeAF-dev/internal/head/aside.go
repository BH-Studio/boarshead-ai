// Ephemeral asks (8.2.9): directions are journal, curiosity is cheap.
//
// The law it completes is 5.18's: `@task` SPEECH lands durably in the task's
// thread, because it is direction and direction has to be replayable. A
// QUESTION about running work — "why did you pick that one?", "what is it
// actually doing right now?" — is not direction. It changes nothing, it is
// asked and answered and finished, and putting it through an ordinary turn
// makes the orchestrator carry both halves of it in every subsequent prompt, in
// the most expensive position there is, forever.
//
// "Ephemeral" here means ephemeral TO THE MODEL'S CONTEXT and never to the
// record. Journal-is-truth holds and 5.20's no-dead-air rule holds, so:
//
//   - The exchange journals a COLLAPSED ONE-LINE STUB in the room where it was
//     asked — "▸ asked → answered" — with both halves under it as a part. It is
//     durable, expandable, searchable and referable later. The echo the person
//     needs exists; it just does not take a turn's worth of space.
//   - The full exchange stays OUT of the orchestrator's context. What the next
//     turn's thread window sees is the one line, because the window renders
//     bodies and the exchange lives in the part.
//   - The full exchange stays out of the orchestrator's PROMPT CACHE, under its
//     own cache key rather than below a floor. 12.4.1's prefix ordering is
//     cache-critical and regression-tested, and an ephemeral turn that shared
//     the orchestrator's prefix would either reorder it or evict it — costing
//     more than the turn it saved. A different system message is a different
//     prefix from byte zero, which is the cleanest separation available and the
//     one this takes.
//
// It is also a different SHAPE of call, and that is where most of the saving is:
// no tools. An aside is curiosity, and curiosity has no authority — so the belt
// is not sent, the ~4.4k tokens of definitions are not paid for, and there is
// no arm by which a question about running work could change it.

	// else's model needs to answer one question. What keeps an aside small is

	// key per ROOM is not enough here, because an aside can run while that room's
	// turn is streaming and the two would share it. A surface that has not
	// learned this key renders nothing, which is the correct failure: an aside
	// silently typing itself into the main transcript is exactly the bug.

// on every ordinary message — must never lose that competition to a question
// nobody will refer to again. It deliberately does not even open with the same
// word, so "its own cache key" is a property a test can state exactly rather
// than an argument about how many leading bytes an endpoint forgives.
//
// It is also a genuinely different job. The orchestrator's prompt is mostly
// about what its hands are and what they may not do; this one has no hands.

Answer from what is in front of you and from nothing else. If the answer is not there, say plainly that it is not — an aside is cheap precisely because it is allowed to come back empty, and a confident reconstruction is worth less than nothing here.

Be short. Two or three sentences, no preamble, no restating the question, no offer to go and do anything. Speak in their terms: a step is a step, the work is the work, and none of the machinery's own names for itself belong in the answer.`
