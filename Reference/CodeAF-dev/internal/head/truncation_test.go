// Session bd3c78ed asked for a diagram, got 1,611 characters of one, and the
// journal recorded it as an answer. The turn had ended at exactly 600
// completion tokens — the cap this route still sets — and the provider said so
// in finish_reason, which every consumer then discarded by calling Text().
//
// These tests drive the real Serve path through the real streaming adapter,
// because the whole defect lived between the wire and the posted message. What
// they assert is a mark, not a change: the body posted must be byte for byte
// what it was before parts existed, and the fact that it was cut must ride
// beside it where a renderer can find it.
//
// The one thing that moved with the tool loop is what the wire carries. There is
// no router envelope any more: a turn that calls no tool speaks in plain prose
// and that prose IS the reply, so these fixtures stream words rather than JSON.
// The finish_reason seam they exercise is untouched by that.

// finishReasonServer answers every answering call with the same reply and the
// finish reason under test.
