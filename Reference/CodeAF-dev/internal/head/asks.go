// The head's asks, as parts rather than as prose carrying a payload.
//
// 13.3's first bug, from the producing side. The head has two ways to ask: a
// conversational askback that lives on a message alone — "which job do you
// mean?", "when should I do it?", the ask tool's numbered options — and a
// durable question that goes through the agent-question lifecycle, which is
// every consent gate. Both used to render their choices twice: once as the
// typed options column that nothing read, and once as a JSON blob inside the
// message body that the old chat recovered with a brace scanner. The moment a
// renderer drew the journal honestly, the blob was on screen as words the head
// appeared to have said.
//
// The durable half is fixed in the store, at the one function every producer's
// question reaches (surfaceQuestion). This file is the conversational half, and
// it is the same contract: the body says what a person would say, the parts say
// what a renderer needs, and the options stay exactly where they already were.

// postQuestion posts one conversational askback.
//
// There is no lifecycle row behind it, which is the whole difference between
// this and a consent gate: the answer comes back as an ordinary message and the
// party that asked is the party that reads it. So the question part carries
// seq 0 and says so, rather than pointing at a row that does not exist.
//
// The body is humane — the prompt, then one numbered line per option — because
// nothing in a conversational askback needs the payload's two extra facts: they
// are all choose questions, none preselects an answer, and all of them accept
// free text. The existing chat parses that spelling at full fidelity, so it
// loses nothing at all by the change (11.1).

// askConfig is the one place a durable question's drawing contract is stated.
//
// Every consent gate in this package built the same three-field config inline,
// which meant three copies of a decision — how it is drawn, what stands if
// nobody answers, whether free text is accepted — that has to agree for the
// gate to mean anything. It agrees here instead.

// askBody is the body a durable question is journaled with. It goes through the
// store's own chooser rather than straight to the payload encoder: a question
// that preselects an answer or refuses free text keeps the payload, because the
// numbered spelling cannot carry either and both are consent semantics the
// existing chat must not lose; anything else stops carrying a payload at all.
