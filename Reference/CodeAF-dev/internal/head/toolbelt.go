// Every deterministic recognizer in this package was written after a live
// failure, and each one answered its failure by learning more words. That road
// has no end: a person can always phrase "kill everything except the finance
// one" in a way no cue list anticipated. So this file stops constraining the
// utterance space and constrains the action space instead. The model is handed
// typed tools over the graph and nothing else — it can read the board, one
// job's whole result, a file that job actually wrote, and codeaf's own manual;
// it can ask for one of five verbs against ids it read there; and it can write
// one durable line into the notebook. Every rule that
// makes a change safe lives inside the tools: the store's own legality table,
// the class path's unit rule, the surgery gates, the ordinary journalled
// commands, the same structured confirm question. A model that misreads the
// sentence therefore costs at most one confirmation question, never a silent
// wrong action, and the deterministic recognizers keep the fast path they have.
