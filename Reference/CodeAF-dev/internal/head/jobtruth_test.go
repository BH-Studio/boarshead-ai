// The incident, reconstructed.
//
// A craft job had been running thirty-two minutes. Six parts were done and
// showing done on the rail. A dollar and three cents had been spent. Its root
// was on its second attempt after a deadline restart, and its workers had been
// posting progress the whole way — "benchmark done", "writeup nearly there".
// The person asked the head to look at the tasks and summarize what was working.
// The head answered: "The benchmark run (craft-4958) is still in its first step.
// It just started, running under a minute, $1.00 of spend so far."
//
// Four wrong things, and not one of them was a wrong sentence. The clock came
// off the CURRENT ATTEMPT's claim stamp, so a restart made a long job new. The
// grain was AgeLabel's, whose finest reading under an hour is "just now". The
// plan said one step, which was true and told the person nothing. And the raw
// id was the first column of the read, so the composition picked it up on its
// way past. Every one of them is a read, which is why every fix here is one.

// seedRestartedBenchmark is the incident's shape: a job with a plan, its parts
// finished, its root running again after a restart, with its workers talking.
