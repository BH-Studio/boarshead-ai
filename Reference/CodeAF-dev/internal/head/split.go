// Split-on-divergence (the August 2026 chat-simplification audit, no longer in
// the tree, J1) and the one cross-seam contract (5.4).
//
// A working conversation drifts. Somewhere in the middle of the pricing thread
// the person says "unrelated, but can you look at the deploy failures" — and
// until now that sentence had exactly one place to go: the pricing thread, where
// it stayed forever, taking the room's name with it and burying both subjects in
// one transcript. The product's answer is an OFFER, never chrome: the head asks
// whether that should be its own thread, and consistent yeses teach the ask gate
// to stop asking and simply do it.
//
// Settling it is the only place in the system where an answer moves the SURFACE,
// and the whole design of the seam is in one sentence: the coupling is
// journal-only. The gate writes two rows and nothing else.
//
//  1. In the OLD room, a system row whose body is "continuing in a new thread"
//     and which carries a store.PartRoomSwitch part naming the new room. The
//     surface applies it on its ordinary poll — composer and view re-point — and
//     a surface that has never heard of the part shows a readable line and is
//     merely out of date.
//  2. In the NEW room, the person's pivot message reposted VERBATIM under their
//     own role, so the new thread opens with what they actually said and the
//     head answers it there on the ordinary poll.
//
// The row in the old room is the one system-voiced thing the head writes, and it
// is written directly rather than through a postSystem helper because 13.18's
// law stands: the head has three things it may SAY, and this is not one of them.
// It is not speech. It is the window moving, drawn as a ruled line rather than
// as a sentence somebody said, and giving it a voice would make the colleague
// narrate its own furniture.
//
// The new room is not named here. The scribe names it from its first exchange on
// its ordinary post-turn lane, which is moments later and is the same lane every
// other room is named on — inventing a title at mint time would be a second
// namer to keep in step with the first.

// roomSwitchBody is the old room's last line, and it is a wire form: the surface
// renders the part rather than the prose, but a reader scrolling the old thread
// weeks later reads this.
const roomSwitchBody = "continuing in a new thread"

// splitThread mints the new room, journals the switch in the old one, and
// reposts the pivot into the new one. It returns the new room's id.
//
// The order of the two writes is the order a reader needs them in: the switch
// lands first, so a surface polling between the two writes moves to a room that
// already exists and then watches the person's own words arrive in it. The
// reverse order would show an empty room for a poll tick and then rewrite it.
