// A charter-fired job carries OriginTrigger. It passed renderGraph, which
// filtered nothing; it passed beltAddressable, which excludes only OriginSelf;
// and it failed boardRows, which additionally demanded OriginUser. So the head
// showed the user the job and answered questions about it, the user said "stop
// that job", and the belt replied that there is no work of the user's with that
// id. One conversation, one table, three rules, and the head denying a job it
// had just described.
//
// There is one table now — the prompt's board and the belt's board are the same
// query through the same renderer — so the three rules can no longer disagree by
// construction. The test still walks all three surfaces, because "they cannot
// disagree" is a claim about the code and this is the evidence for it.
