// The head's world may not be smaller than what is happening in it.
//
// Every read on this belt resolved through [store.ActiveNodes], which is the
// COMPACT view: a fold's outermost representative stands in for its members, so
// a job that has been filed away is one line instead of forty. That is the
// right shape for history and the wrong shape for anything alive, and the day
// the two met the belt produced its worst possible sentence. A continuation was
// running, seven minutes in, a cent spent, plainly drawn on the rail. Asked to
// cancel it, the head read the board three times, searched five times, and
// answered that there was no such work — a false negative that reads as a
// judgement, and left the person with no way to stop their own job but raw SQL.
//
// The law these two helpers carry is one sentence: FOLDING HIDES NOTHING THAT
// IS STILL ALIVE. Folding is filing, filing is for work that is over, and a
// node that is running, claimed or pending is not over however old its lineage
// is. So every belt read that turns on liveness — the board, the sets a verb
// resolves, the counts on the status page — reads the active view UNIONED with
// the open one, and a live node reaches the head as its own row whatever has
// been filed around it.

// errNoGraph is the refusal a read owes a surface with nothing behind it. The
// belt's tools already answer in these words; the helpers below reach the store
// before a tool's own guard has run, so they carry it too.
