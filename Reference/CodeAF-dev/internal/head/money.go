// Money is computed, never spoken into existence (13.3's head edge, under
// 5.23's ordering law).
//
// The failure: a charter proposal offered to run something "at $20.00 a run"
// against a measured cost of $0.0017. Ten thousand times the truth, in the one
// sentence a person is being asked to consent to spending on. Nothing in the
// machinery had computed $20.00; a model had written it, in prose, beside a
// number it had been shown.
//
// 5.23's ordering law is deterministic first, scribe second, frontier last, and
// it says out loud what this file exists to enforce: anything a template can say
// stays a template, because free beats ultra-cheap and both beat a frontier
// model doing arithmetic in a sentence. Money is the extreme case of that rule
// rather than an exception to it — an invented figure about tokens is a wrong
// answer, and an invented figure about dollars is a wrong answer the person acts
// on.
//
// So every money sentence in this package is assembled the same way: a figure is
// COMPUTED here from journaled rows and rendered here into words, and the model
// is handed the finished figure to write a sentence around. Where a model's own
// number could previously survive into a rail or a receipt, it no longer can.
//
// This file is the ONLY place in internal/head that spells a dollar figure, and
// TestOnlyMoneyGoSpellsADollarFigureInTheHead holds that boundary. moneyUSD is
// the exact figure for anything a person reads as a measurement: a plan step, a
// result, a finished window, a receipt or a rail. dimeUSD belongs to the live
// board and the depth block alone, where precision is allowed only when it is as
// stable as the figure; its own comment carries the reason for that narrower
// spelling.
//
// A dime-rounded figure of a few cents therefore still reads "$0.00". That is
// the live board buying stability at a known price, not an overlooked measured
// cost: internal/tui2/tokens/format_test.go's TestMoneyForms pins
// MoneyDime(0.004) as "$0.00" while its sub-cent law covers Money alone, and
// #616 did not reopen that decision.

// moneyUSD renders one amount at the precision it actually has.
//
// Two decimals is the product's ordinary spelling and it is exactly wrong for
// this job: a real measured cost of $0.0017 rendered at two decimals is "$0.00",
// which reads as free. A figure that rounds a true cost to nothing invites the
// same fabrication from the other end — a model shown "$0.00 a run" has been
// told the measurement is meaningless and will reach for a number that is not.
//
// Cents for anything a person would think of in cents, four decimals below that,
// and a floor that says "small" in words rather than pretending to a precision
// the journal does not have.
