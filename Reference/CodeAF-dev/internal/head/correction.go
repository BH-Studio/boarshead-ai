// "That's wrong" is the strongest quality signal a person ever emits, and it
// had no home. The recognizer written for that exact sentence lives in
// redirectCue and returns ("correction", true) for it — and recognizeRedirect
// then throws the reading away, because it requires live work and a delivered
// job is settled and folded within the same reconciler tick that announced it.
// Below that, the head's own routing law taught the model that "that's wrong"
// means retract a notebook belief, so the most likely reply to a factual
// correction of a report was "· let go —" about an unrelated preference. The
// correction fell off the end of the pipeline in three different ways.
//
// What it should be is not new machinery. The delivery gate already runs a
// revision pass over a rejected deliverable, handing the leaf the previous
// attempt and the critique as one input; a user's correction is that same
// shape, arriving from the only party whose opinion outranks the gate's. So a
// correction is a REVISION of the deliverable: the same job, its own words, its
// previous attempt, and what the user says is wrong with it.
//
// The seam is deliberately the smallest one that is honest. store.Command has
// no correction kind and adding one is a store change this does not need: a
// splice already carries a Target meaning "the prior work this one continues",
// the store already accepts a splice aimed at settled work (validateNodeCommand
// exempts splices from the status table), and the instruction is a durable
// payload. So the head journals a splice at the job that was wrong, carrying
// the user's verbatim words and — marked, so the resident can read it back —
// what was delivered. Everything downstream that improves this is additive and
// named in the report: inheriting the predecessor's workspace so the revision
// edits report.md in place rather than writing a second one, and feeding the
// critique to the distiller, whose prompt already asks for exactly this input
// and has never had a wire to it.

//
// A leaf ended "Everything is verified. The browser builds cleanly, launches a
// Fyne window…" while the person watching it was typing "I keep getting could
// not load, no page is loading". The delivery gate believed the leaf, and the
// revision spawned from the user's words inherited that belief as an input: the
// previous attempt arrives as trusted context, and "verified" inside it reads as
// settled ground the revision may build on rather than the exact claim under
// dispute. Then it re-verifies nothing, and says "verified" again.
//
// So the block says which of the two accounts is evidence. It names no symptom
// and no phrase — what counts as a claim, and what would settle it, is the
// model's judgment on the words in front of it. It only fixes the standing:
// the user was there, the predecessor is a witness for itself.
