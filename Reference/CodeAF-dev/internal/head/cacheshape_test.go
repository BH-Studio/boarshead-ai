// Position is by volatility, never by semantic category. The thread leads
// because it is the only block that appends: a turn extends its tail and every
// byte before the extension is reused. Everything that is REWRITTEN IN PLACE —
// measured history, the board, the notebook, the clock, the spend line —
// belongs below it, in the order of how fast it moves, because a block that
// changes in place invalidates everything after it and nothing before it.
//
// The rule survives the collapse into one loop intact and matters more than it
// did: there used to be a router prompt and a belt prompt, so no single string
// was the whole stable prefix. orchestratorPrompt is, now, and every byte of the
// user message under it is billed against exactly one cache.
