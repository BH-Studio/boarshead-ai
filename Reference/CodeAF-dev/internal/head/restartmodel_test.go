// "rerun that with the better model" matched the restart cue, was handled
// deterministically, and re-ran the failure on the default slot — the model
// words were never parsed on any path but a fresh compile. Now the restart
// carries the reading, in the payload the store already has room for.
//
// The reading is read at the journaling door rather than in a recognizer, which
// is why it survived the recognizers being demoted: every route to a restart —
// the change tool's words, a set, a confirmed question replayed later — goes
// through the same funnel and picks up the same mark.
