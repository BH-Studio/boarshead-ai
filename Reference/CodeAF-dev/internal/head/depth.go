// whatever the user asked. It is the right answer to "what's going on" and the
// wrong answer to "what happened with the finance thing" — the findings live in
// the full summary and in the files the work wrote, and the head never saw
// either, so it could only say "it was completed". Status instead of substance.
//
// The fix is not a bigger board. Breadth and depth are different budgets: the
// board is the floor and must never starve, so it keeps its own bytes and its
// one line per job, and depth is bought separately, for the few jobs this
// particular message is about. Which jobs those are is a relevance question,
// answered by the same in-memory BM25 the redirect path already ranks with, at
// the same floor — never by a phrase list, because the next phrasing is always
// one nobody wrote down.

// Every number in this block is a floor now rather than a ceiling: it is what
// depth gets on a window nobody sized, and budget.go raises it in proportion on
// a window it can. The arguments below are unchanged — they are why these are
// the right numbers for the twenty-two-kilobyte prompt they were written for.
