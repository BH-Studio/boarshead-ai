// The belt's calls go through the real adapter here, streamed, because that is
// the only place the defect lived: the accumulator dropped tool calls, so every
// belt turn came back with none, the loop spent a full board-and-notebook round
// trip that could not succeed, and the message was paid for a second time.
// The assertion is the one that matters — the tools actually ran — and the count
// is what says the round trip was not wasted.

// beltStreamServer answers with tool calls and then with text, all over the
// event stream, and records what it was asked. Every call the loop makes carries
// tools now, so a call with none is itself a finding: nothing in the head speaks
// to a model without offering it hands.
