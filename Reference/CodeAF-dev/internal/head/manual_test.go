// undocumentedHands was a RATCHET for the hands this wave landed before the

// — as the place the next capability lands, and as the record that the ratchet
// closed rather than being deleted when it became inconvenient.
//
// What closed it: steering-work.md gained "What the front desk's hands actually
// are". The gap was real and it was in internal/manual rather than in this
// package — the manual is the only honest source for a question about codeaf
// itself, so until the page existed, "can you stop what you're doing?" was a
// question the head could only improvise about.
