// label. Measured live on `~deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-latest`, that collapsed
// structure the person had SAID OUT LOUD: "plan and run this as two dependent
// steps, not one … step two must not start before step one is done" compiled to
// scale "task" three times out of three, and so did an ask that both enumerates
// and stratifies ("a short note on each one first, and then one comparison
// table … that uses all three notes"). One leaf each, no planning pass, and the
// ordering the person asked for recorded nowhere.
//
// The rule now separates the two questions it was conflating, and every phrase
// pinned here is one of the joints where they used to fuse.
