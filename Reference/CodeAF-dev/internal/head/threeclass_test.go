// THE THREE-CLASS LAW, held over a whole cycle (13.18).
//
// A thread message is a COMMITMENT, a DELIVERY or a QUESTION. Nothing else may
// be in a conversation: not a compile phase, not a stage advance, not the
// receipt for a change the head already said out loud. Those are the work
// RECORD's, and the record is the room, read by node.
//
// The measurement this exists to make impossible: thirty of the forty-three
// messages under one real job were `setting working standards · N of 4`, and
// five consecutive copies were the first screen of a fresh task room (13.17
// item 2, H13). Nothing filtered them, because nothing had ever said which
// sentences a thread is FOR.
//
// So the assertion is the whole thread, row by row, with the class each row
// belongs to named. A producer that grows a fourth kind of sentence fails here
// with the sentence printed, which is the only failure mode worth having.
