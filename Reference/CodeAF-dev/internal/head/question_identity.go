// A reply carries the identity of the question it answers whenever the surface
// that took it knew which one was on screen — a clicked option row, a chosen
// card, a question picked out of the dock. This file is what happens when it
// does not: a bare "1" typed into the composer while two jobs are both waiting
// on an answer.
//
// The store's rule for that case is "the newest surfaced question wins", and
// with one question open it is exactly right. With two it is a coin toss
// wearing a rule, and the losing side of the toss is not a typo — it is a plan
// approved that nobody read, and a worker left blocked on a question that has
// been silently spent. So when more than one open question would accept the
// same reply, the head does what a person does: it asks, once, in plain words,
// and applies the answer it was already given to whichever one they name.
//
// Nothing here is a picker. There are no numbered options, no new surface and
// no mode: one sentence naming the two things, and the next sentence settles
// it. If that next sentence names neither, the question was not a choice
// between them and it goes on to ordinary conversation — the ask never repeats.

// Only questions that would actually take this reply compete, which is the same
// test the resolution path applies a moment later: a standing-watch decision or
// an unratified charter lets ordinary words go by, so words those questions
// would ignore are not a choice between them. A reply exactly one open question
// would take is aimed at that one even when a newer question sits on top —
// that is the evidence a person would use, and the newest-wins rule has no
