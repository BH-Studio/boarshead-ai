// Turn-cancel, promoted from a keypress.
//
// Part 2.4: `Head.Interrupt` is an in-process handle bound to a TUI keypress. It
// is not a command kind, not journaled, and not reachable from another surface,
// from a headless caller, or from the head itself. Decision 7's lens law says
// chat and headless differ only in where the task comes from, and an escape key
// that only exists in one of them is a feature that only exists in one of them.
//
// This file is the whole of the head's half. RequestInterrupt is the door: it
// journals the stop as an ordinary command through the ONE funnel, exactly like
// every other authority in the product, and falls back to the in-process handle
// when the journal cannot carry it yet. ApplyInterrupt is the arm the reconciler
// would call — complete, tested, and callable from one line.
//
// # THE SEAM, HALF OPEN (12.3.3)
//
// The store half has landed: `store.CommandHeadInterrupt` is a legal kind and a
// global command, so RequestInterrupt's journal road is real and a stop is now a
// durable row like every other authority in the product.
//
// The reconciler half has NOT. `applyCommand` and its call sites live in
// internal/resident/resident.go with no registration seam, and internal/resident
// is co-working territory for this campaign. The remaining edit, for whoever
// takes it, is one case:
//
//	case store.CommandHeadInterrupt:
//	    return h.head.ApplyInterrupt(command), nil
//
// where the resident already holds the head it serves. ApplyInterrupt is
// idempotent and reports whether there was a turn to stop, which is exactly the
// resolution the reconciler wants to journal.
//
// Until that case exists the row is written and nothing drains it, which is why
// this door ALSO stops the turn in process on its way out. That is not
// belt-and-braces and it is not a race: the two roads reach the same idempotent
// handle, and a door that journals a stop the surface can see and then lets the
// turn keep talking is a lie told in the one place the person is watching.
// When the reconciler's case lands, ApplyInterrupt finds the turn already gone
// and says so, which is a true resolution rather than a second cancellation.

// HeadInterruptKind is the command kind a journaled turn-cancel carries. It is
// an alias rather than a second spelling: the store owns the kind list, and two
// constants holding one string is how a kind quietly becomes two kinds.
const HeadInterruptKind = store.CommandHeadInterrupt

// InterruptRoute says which way a stop actually travelled.

// lands nothing drains that row, and a door that reports a stop while the turn
// carries on talking is worse than one that never claimed it.
