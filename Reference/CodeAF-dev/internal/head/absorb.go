// The turn that closes the loop a person started when they asked for something.
//
// A commissioned job used to end with its own deliverable posted into the thread
// by the resident and nothing else: the answer to their question arrived as a
// card written by the work, in the work's own register, and the colleague they
// had been talking to never said a word about it. The person's own sketch of
// what should happen is exactly this file: "then it responds the task result to
// the user based on the initial ask — it contains all info in its context to
// respond: past chat, main user text, the task we created, the result."
//
// So a settled job wakes the head for ONE short turn. It is the DELIVERY
// sentence class of the product stance — the head speaking, in the thread, in
// its own voice — and it is deliberately not a second copy of the delivery card
// beside it: the card carries the artifact rows, the money and the elapsed, and
// re-saying those is the duplication the card exists to end. What the head adds
// is the one thing only it has: the ask this answers, and what the result means
// for it.
//
// It was, for a while, a deliberately tiny turn: no tools, 600 tokens, a
// four-kilobyte peek at the result, and a standing order not to restate anything
// — because the whole result was pasted verbatim underneath whatever it wrote.
// That shape answered the paraphrase incident (§13.4, two generated summaries
// disagreeing with each other and with the verified text) by making generation
// structurally impossible, and it bought that with the person's actual answer:
// what they got was a machine's output with one polite line on top of it.
//
// The answer contract inverts it (the August 2026 chat-simplification audit,
// no longer in the tree, §2.6). RAW IN — the turn now
// reads the result whole, opens the file when that is where the substance lives,
// and can read the plan or the board if the ask needs it. COMPOSED OUT — what it
// writes is the answer to the question that started the work, sized to its
// content, findings first and the path after. The verbatim result is still
// journaled and still rendered as the job's own deliverable; it is the record,
// not the message. And the defect the tiny turn was guarding against is
// addressed at its actual cause: a model that has read the whole deliverable is
// not the model that invented the other three quarters of it.
//
// Three bounds keep it affordable and honest.
//   - It fires for work the PERSON asked for, in a room, and never for the
//     resident's own practice, sentinels or standing furniture. Self-directed
//     work has nobody waiting on an answer, and paying a turn to narrate it to
//     an empty room is the exact cost this system is careful about.
//   - It fires once, off the delivery row the resident already posts, and the
//     poll's own cursor is what makes it once.
//   - Its hands are the READS and nothing else (beltReadOnly). The work is
//     finished: there is everything to find out and nothing left to change, and
//     a turn woken by an outcome must not be able to start anything.

const absorbPrompt = `Work the person asked for has finished, and you are the one who talks to them. This turn is the ANSWER to the ask that started it — the last mile between work settling and a person knowing what came of it.

Read before you write. The result is below in full. When its substance is in a file the work wrote, open that file and read it: a pointer is not an answer, and you have the reads to go and get it. Read the plan, another result or the board too if that is what answering honestly takes.

Then answer THEIR question, in your own voice. The finding, the verdict, the numbers, the recommendation — first, in the opening sentence, before anything about the work itself. Size the answer to what there is to say: one line when one line is the whole truth of it, several paragraphs when the answer genuinely has parts. Where a document was produced, name its path AFTER the substance, never instead of it.

If the work fell short of what they asked, say that plainly and say what is missing. A shortfall named is worth more to them than a completion announced.

Never report completion. "It's done", "the task finished", "the report is ready above" are not answers — that the machinery finished is not news to somebody who asked a question. Neither is a wall of the work's own output with a sentence on top: that is the record, and it is already kept.

Say only what you actually read this turn. Every number is quoted from something in front of you, never worked out, rounded or remembered. If the result and a file disagree, the file the work wrote is what happened.

Speak entirely in their terms. The machinery's names for itself — node, leaf, graph, splice, subtree, worker, craft, charter, board, task — belong to the machinery, never to this answer.`
