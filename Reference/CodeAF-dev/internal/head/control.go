// What is left of the control loop.
//
// The loop itself is gone — there is one loop now, and it runs on every message
// rather than behind a keyword trigger (loop.go). What survives here is the
// vocabulary the trigger was made of, and it survives because it turned out to
// be worth something other than what it was built for: these tables are a cheap,
// instant reading of what a sentence is ABOUT, and a reading is exactly what a
// prompt can carry as evidence. hints.go renders them. Nothing in this file can
// answer a message, open a loop, or stop anything reaching the tools.
//
// The trigger's own arms — controlLoopApplies and the two anchor readers — are
// deleted rather than demoted. Their whole job was deciding whether the tools
// were worth opening, and that question no longer exists.

// controlVerbs are the words that make a sentence plausibly about existing
// work. This list is deliberately not a grammar and never grows into one: it is
// a cheap trigger, not a reading. A false positive costs one model call that
// returns the sentinel; a false negative costs nothing but today's behaviour.
