// §13.4 and what actually answers it.
//
// Twelve leaves spent twelve minutes and twelve dollars' worth of tokens
// verifying twelve technical profiles against live documentation. The head then
// wrote the person two messages, both opening "Here are the 12 technical
// profiles:", neither of which was the researched text and neither of which
// agreed with the other: one said Chroma keeps SQLite-backed metadata, the
// other that it stores collections as Parquet files, and the verified result
// said something different again. Two generations disagreeing on fact is proof
// they were generated.
//
// For a while the answer to that was to relay: the head wrote one sentence and
// the code pasted the whole deliverable underneath it. That made generation
// impossible and made the person's answer a machine's raw output. The answer
// contract (the August 2026 chat-simplification audit, no longer in the tree,
// §2.6) fixes the actual cause instead — the turn was
// shown a QUARTER of the deliverable and asked to speak about the whole — so
// what this pins now is that the turn is given all of it.
