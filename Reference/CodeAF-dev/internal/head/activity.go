// What the turn is DOING, said out loud while it does it.
//
// THE DEFECT, in the reader's words: while the head runs its tool loop the
// person watches one pulsing line that says `thinking` and nothing else. A turn
// that reads the board, opens two results, opens the file one of them wrote and
// then commissions work spends most of a minute looking — from the outside —
// exactly like a turn that has hung. The tokens the model streams are the only
// thing the surface ever hears about, and between two tool calls there are no
// tokens.
//
// So the loop narrates itself. Around every belt call it emits two boundaries on
// the SAME channel the tokens ride ([provider.Emit]): a begin carrying a
// person-readable gloss of the call, and an end carrying its outcome and, where
// it is cheap, a short hint about what came back. The surface interleaves them
// with the words, and when the turn lands it folds them into one row.
//
// TWO LAWS ON THE GLOSS, and both of them are about not leaking the machine.
//
//   - IT IS NEVER THE ARGUMENTS. `{"q":"navctx","status":"running"}` is the
//     shape 5.14 calls the never-shown tier: a reader who wanted to know what a
//     JSON object looked like would not be waiting for an answer. Every gloss
//     here is a sentence with a verb in it.
//   - IT IS NEVER A LIE ABOUT WHAT WAS ASKED. A gloss that cannot find the
//     argument it wanted falls back to the plain shape of the call ("looking
//     something up") rather than inventing a subject — the same rule the rest of
//     this surface calls honest degradation.
//
// The vocabulary is the person's, not the belt's: `board` is "looking at the
// work", `recall` is "searching", `task` is "putting work in hand". §14's ban on
// machinery vocabulary applies to a line a person reads, and this is one.

// executeWatched runs one belt call with the turn narrating it.
//
// It is the ONE seam. Both loops that run this belt — the ordinary turn
// (loop.go) and the delivery absorption that answers when work lands
// (absorb.go) — call it instead of [beltRun.execute], so the activity a person
// sees is the activity that happened, in both directions, with no second
// emitter to keep in step. Everything about the call itself is unchanged: same
// arguments, same result, same failure flag.
//
// A context with no observer on it — every headless run, every test that does
// not ask — pays two context lookups and emits nothing.
