// The scribe that names rooms (8.2.13, filed as 13.3 bug 4).
//
// "untitled room" was always the honest placeholder — the rail draws a room's
// title and never its id (13.3.4), so a room nobody has named has nothing else
// to be called. What made it a P0 was that NOTHING ever named one: the naming
// clerk was designed as a head-side, post-turn, tiny-model call and never wired,
// so every room in the rail wore the placeholder and the reader could not tell
// one from another.
//
// Four constraints shape everything below, and each of them is a way this could
// have gone wrong:
//
//   - It never blocks the reply. The person's answer is posted, the turn ends,
//     and only then does the poll hand the room to a goroutine. A title that took
//     a second to think of would otherwise be a second of silence in front of
//     every first answer.
//   - It fires once per room, and the room's own title is the record of that.
//     There is no "named" flag to keep in step with the thing it describes: a
//     titled room is a named room, and the check is the same read the rail does.
//   - It costs pennies. The scribe role (5.23's ladder) resolves the model — a
//     labeller, not a judge — and the call carries two clipped messages. What
//     keeps it small is the clipping and the prompt; see the const block below
//     for the ceiling that used to be here and why it is not.
//   - The title goes through the same normalizer every other title in this
//     package goes through, so a model that answers `"Billing audit."` and one
//     that answers `Billing audit` land on the same row.

// THE NAMING CALL CARRIES NO CEILING, and the two numbers that used to be here
// are the argument for that. The first was 32 — arithmetic on the ANSWER, "a
// 2-5 word title is under ten tokens, leave room for a preamble" — and on a
// model that reasons before it speaks the thinking took all 32 before the first
// character of the title was written: measured live against the owner's own
// endpoint, `finish_reason:"length"` with `content:null` every single time, and
// every room in the rail wore the placeholder. The second was 512, plus an 8192
// relief retry when 512 did the same thing. Each was a better guess at a
// quantity this file has no way to know, on a model an operator picked and this
// file has never heard of. The prompt asks for a name and two lines; what
// bounds the reply is the model's own default, and there is nothing left for a
// relief round to relieve.

// the subject of a conversation but not the name it ended up with — which is
// why they are asked for as SUBJECTS and not as a summary in list form.
const scribePrompt = `You name conversations.

Given the first exchange of a conversation, answer with exactly two lines.

Line 1 — the title: 2 to 5 words naming what the conversation is about, so a
reader can tell it from a dozen others in a list.
- 2 to 5 words. No sentence, no punctuation at the end, no quotes.
- Name the subject, not the act: "billing audit", not "user asks for help".

Line 2 — the tags: up to 3 topic words, lowercase, separated by commas.
- One or two words each. They are for searching, so use the words a person
  would type months later when looking for this conversation again.
- Name subjects, not sentiments and not the shape of the request.
- If nothing beyond the title is worth filing it under, leave the line empty.

No preamble, no explanation, no labels. The two lines are the whole answer.`
