// The belt narrows; it never empties.
//
// THE INCIDENT. A person asked for the figures in a paper. The head opened the
// images that already existed, was told "no, from the paper itself", and went to
// work: render the pages, find the caption boxes, prepare the crops. Sixteen
// calls in, mid-campaign, it reached the runaway bound — and the bound took away
// every hand at once. What was left could only speak, so it said the belt was
// spent and that it would finish next turn. It had no next turn: the turn is the
// only thing the head owns, and a promise made about the one after it is a
// promise made by nobody. The person had to type "use and submit it as a task
// then" themselves, which is the product asking its owner to operate it.
//
// THE FIX IS THE BELT, NOT A RULE. A prompt line saying "when you run out of
// calls, submit a task" is case law: it works on the case we saw and on nothing
// else, and this package spent a year removing exactly that kind of sentence.
// So the bound changes what the head is HOLDING rather than what it is told. At
// the cap the next completion is armed with the work verbs alone — the hands
// that give work away, not the hands that do it — and one round later the turn
// ends whatever it did with them. The economics do the judging: a head with
// unfinished work and only `task` in its hand reaches for `task`, and a head
// that finished simply answers. Neither of those is a case we enumerated.
//
// The bound still bounds. One narrowed round is one round: it cannot read, it
// cannot run anything, and the turn ends after it whether it produced a receipt
// or nothing at all.

// beltWorkVerb names the narrowed belt: the two verbs that hand work over.
//
// task gives unfinished work to the workforce and stop withdraws it, and those
// are the only two honest endings for a turn that ran out of room to work. The
// third verb of the triad is deliberately not here: change relays the PERSON's
// words to work already under way, and a turn holding words of theirs to relay
// would have relayed them with its first call rather than its seventeenth.
//
// It is written as a predicate over names, like beltReadOnly above it, so the
// guard in the loop and the definitions handed to the model are the same
// statement read twice rather than two lists to keep in step.
