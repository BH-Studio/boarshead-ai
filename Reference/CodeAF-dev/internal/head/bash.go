// The head's hands, for the two seconds a person would not have thought about.
//
// Everything durable in this product flows through spawn: compile, plan, graph,
// workers, receipt. That is right for work and it was, until this file, the ONLY
// route anything had — so "open signal.html in a browser" either minted a whole
// job (three model calls, a fresh workspace, the wrong directory) or came back as
// "I can't open a browser for you — that's on your side", which is a refusal the
// orchestrator's own voice law forbids and which was said out loud on 2026-08-11
// anyway, because it was true: the head had no hands at all.
//
// THE TOOL IS CALLED bash, AND THE NAME IS THE FIX. It was called `act` for one
// wave, and on 2026-08-12 the same failure came back wearing different words: a
// story sat on disk, the person said "open the file for me", and the head read
// the file with its own eyes and narrated it instead of putting it on their
// screen. The activity trail shows the loop reaching for read, then board, then
// read again — never the hand. `act` is a concept this codebase invented, and an
// invented concept has to be LEARNED from prose on every turn, which puts it in
// permanent competition with the reading tools whose names a model already
// knows. `bash` is not learned. Every model on the market carries an enormous
// prior for a tool by that name, and under that prior "open the file for me"
// resolves to `open <path>` without anything in a prompt having to argue for it.
// The prose could be rewritten forever; the name only had to be right once.
//
// Three things make this a hand rather than a second executor.
//
//   - The boundary is TIME AND CONSEQUENCE, never topic. There is no list of
//     blessed programs here and there must never be one: `open` is a command like
//     any other, and hardcoding the use cases we happen to have seen is exactly
//     the emergent-capability failure this codebase spent a year unlearning. What
//     is stated is the shape of the thing — one command, whose consequences the
//     gate below can see — and the one principle it belongs to is stated once in
//     the prompt, in the only register that generalises: the hands differ by
//     WHOSE WORLD they change. A read changes what the head knows. This changes
//     what the person experiences, on their machine, right now. Work changes the
//     world durably. Nothing here names an occasion, and nothing here may.
//   - The RESULT is the ground truth. The exit status and the captured output come
//     back as the tool result and the loop narrates that and nothing else. This is
//     not tidiness: the head once said "The site is open — I've launched it" over a
//     job that had found nothing, and a hand whose outcome the model infers rather
//     than reads would have made that hallucination cheaper rather than rarer.
//   - The floor is code, not prose. A description is a persuasion and persuasion
//     is not a membrane, so the same consequence gate that refuses to let anything
//     irreversible ride a reflex (spawn.go) is asked about this command's words
//     too, and a tiny principled list of self-escalating spellings is refused
//     beside it. Both refusals REDIRECT: they hand back the sentence that says to
//     spawn it instead, because a person who asked for something is owed the route
//     that can do it rather than a wall. The gate did NOT move when the bounds
//     below widened, and it is the reason they safely could.
