// The ten deterministic recognizers, demoted.
//
// Each of them was written after a live failure and each answered its failure by
// learning more words; together they formed a sequential ladder whose ordering
// was documented only in comments, where a message that needed orchestration but
// tripped no cue never reached the tools at all (Part 2.2). None of that reading
// was worthless — a prefix test that spots "cancel the line scans" is free,
// instant and usually right. What was wrong was its authority: it ANSWERED,
// terminally, before anything with judgment had seen the sentence.
//
// So the readings survive and the ladder does not. Every recognizer still runs,
// on the same words, with the same vocabulary and the same tests; what it
// produces is now one line of evidence in the prompt, above the message it is
// about, marked as a pre-answer. The loop may consult it, verify it with a read,
// or ignore it. Nothing here can act, ask a question, journal a command, or stop
// the turn — which is the whole of the difference between a hint and a pre-empt.
//
// The block is absent, byte for byte, from a message no recognizer fires on, so
// an ordinary sentence pays nothing for machinery it did not use.

	// hintHeader states what the block is and, in the same breath, what it is
