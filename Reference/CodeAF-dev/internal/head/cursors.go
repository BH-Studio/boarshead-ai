// journal-wide number for both jobs, and a number that says "everything below
// here is handled" is only true of the room whose reply last moved it: with two
// rooms open, an answer in one carries the mark past the other's unanswered
// message and that message is never read again. The rows are per room because
// the question they answer — has this been answered — is per room. The read
// position stays journal-wide because the journal is one sequence and paging it
// once is cheaper than paging it per room.
