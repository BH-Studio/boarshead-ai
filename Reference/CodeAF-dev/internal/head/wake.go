// The receipt wake — the head hearing back about a change it made.
//
// A head turn journals a command and answers in the same breath: "cancelling
// that", "handing this over". Both sentences are written BEFORE anything has
// been decided, because the funnel is asynchronous by design — the tasker
// compiles the ask, the revision judge reads the words, the store's legality
// table has the last say, and all of that happens after the turn has ended. So
// the head has always spoken about a future it could not see, and two things
// went wrong there, repeatedly:
//
//   - The commit-before-shape defect. "I've put that in hand" is true and empty.
//     What the person wants to know is what was UNDERSTOOD — the reading the
//     compiler settled on, the shape it chose — and that arrives one tick later
//     as a receipt in a machine voice, or is filed on a card and never spoken.
//   - The stale correction. The head says "cancelling that job"; the command is
//     then refused because the job finished a second earlier. The refusal is
//     posted by the reconciler in its own words, underneath a sentence of the
//     head's that is now false, and nobody owns the contradiction.
//
// So the settlement wakes the head. The absorb path (absorb.go) already proved
// the shape for finished WORK; this is the same shape for a settled COMMAND, and
// between them the head hears back about everything it starts. The consequence
// worth naming: "I'll tell you what it decides" stopped being a promise the
// machinery cannot keep, which is why the lexical promise-policing that used to
// stand in front of every reply is gone rather than merely relaxed.
const (
	// receiptStreamSuffix keys the wake's deltas apart from the room's own turn,
	// exactly as the delivery turn's are: the person may be typing while this
	// runs, and their reply's stream must not have this one's words in it.
	receiptStreamSuffix = "#receipt"
	// receiptWait is how long the wake may take before the poll gives up on it.
	// The poll is the head's only mail loop; a provider hanging here would stop
	// the person's next message being answered, and a sentence about a change
	// that has already been applied is never worth that.

// receiptRow reports whether one journal row is a command settling.
//
// It is the narrowest reading that finds all three shapes settleCommand posts:
// an applied receipt filed on the job's card (a system row with a node and no
// session), an applied receipt with nowhere to be filed (a system row in the
// room), and a refusal (an agent row in the room, because a refusal always
// speaks). What they share is the only column that matters here — the command
// they settle.
//
// Answers is what keeps the head out of its own mail. The command number is NOT
// unique to a settlement: the head stamps it on its own acknowledgement too, so
// that the surfaces drawing cards can tie the sentence to the work it is about,
// and the head's acknowledgement of a refusal is an agent row in the room
// carrying a command number and a body — the refusal shape, exactly. The two
// were indistinguishable, and the poll reaches the head's own row first because
// the head speaks before the workforce settles.
//
// So a redirect got answered twice by one head. It handed the words over ("those
// words are with the team — they'll make sure the brief uses metric units"), the
// poll read that very sentence back as news from the workforce, and the wake
// paraphrased it into the room a moment later as though something had come back
// ("it stays in metric units, as you asked"). Nothing had come back. The person
// could not tell the restatement from a report, which is the whole thing this
// wake exists to be.
//
// Answers is the discriminator because it already means precisely this and is
// already in the journal: it is the user turn a reply answers, set on every row
// the head posts and on nothing the reconciler writes. A settlement answers no
// turn — it reports one.

// the revision judge: their receipts say what actually happened to the remaining
// plan, which is the one thing the head cannot predict when it promises a
// change. An amendment was attached to live work by the same route.
//
// A pause, a resume, a cancel, a reprioritize, a charter retirement: the store

// that sentence, better, in the person's own words. Waking to say it again is

const receiptWakePrompt = `A change you put in hand a moment ago has come back settled. You are the one who told them it was happening, so you are the one who says what actually became of it.

In front of you: what they asked for, what you said when you handed it over, and what the workforce came back with — how it read the ask, the shape it chose, what it actually changed.

Write one or two sentences, in your own voice, saying what is now true. How they were understood, and what is under way: "it's underway — read as a competitor sweep on the three names, going at it in three steps". Where the reading differs from what they asked for, that difference is the news and goes first, so they can correct it while correcting is still cheap.

If it was REFUSED, correct yourself plainly. You said it was happening and it is not; say what is true instead, in one sentence, without apology and without explaining the machinery.

Say nothing the receipt does not say — the shape, the reading and the count are its facts, not yours to round or improve. Never repeat what you already said a moment ago; they read it, and a sentence that only says it again is noise. If the receipt genuinely adds nothing to what they already know, reply with nothing at all: an empty reply is correct here and costs them nothing.

Speak entirely in their terms. The machinery's names for itself — node, leaf, graph, splice, subtree, worker, craft, charter, board, task, command — belong to the machinery, never to this sentence.`
