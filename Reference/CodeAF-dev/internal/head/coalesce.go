// Coalescing is the answer to the oldest complaint about this surface: you type
// a question, see the head take it, notice the word you got wrong, type the
// correction — and get two replies, the first one answering the question you
// had already withdrawn. It happened by construction. The head answered rows one
// at a time in journal order, and the prompt window for a turn hard-stops at the
// row being answered, so the correction was invisible to the turn it corrected.
//
// The fix is the semantics the worker steering mailbox has always had: drain
// what the person has said into one turn and answer it once. Two rules bound it.
// Freshness, because a sentence typed an hour later is a new conversation rather
// than a second half; and a row ceiling, because somebody typing continuously
// must still be answered.
//
// It does not fold distinct asks away. Five things said in one breath still
// produce five pieces of work — the router's own fan-out reads them out of the
// folded words — but they produce one reply, which is what a person who said
// five things in one breath is waiting for.
