// change: "this thing, but different."
//
// Five tools used to stand here — steer, revise, expedite, and the change halves
// of rule, service and craft — and the split was machinery-shaped rather than
// person-shaped. "use latex please" should both tell the workers already running
// AND fix the remaining plan, and the redirect path has always done both
// (redirect.go broadcasts first, then revises); the belt merely made the model
// choose between two halves of one intent. Worse, the model had to know which
// half it wanted BEFORE anything with the plan in hand had read the sentence.
//
// So the critical move is that change carries NO VERB (the August 2026
// chat-simplification audit, no longer in the tree, §2.3). The
// head binds the person's intent to a target and journals their words verbatim;
// what the words mean is decided on the far side, by the party that can see the
// plan. The revision judge already owns that decision — plan edit, broadcast-only
// constraint, or both — and it keeps it.
//
// The one thing the head still decides is the store kind, and only where the
// store's own verbs are exact: resume, restart and expedite are lifecycle
// transitions with no interpretation in them, and a redirect could not perform
// them however well it read the sentence. Everything else — every sentence about
// what the work IS — goes as CommandRedirect with the words untouched.
//
// Every consent gate and legality check stays where it is: the store's legality
// table, the charter transition table, the craft repository's own refusals.
