// WHICH OF THE HEAD'S TURNS STREAM, AND UNDER WHAT KEY.
//
// The head talks to a model from more places than the conversation, and each one
// answers a different question about the same law: model-authored text that will
// render VISIBLY on the surface a person has open renders as its deltas arrive;
// text that lands folded, or that is not prose at all, arrives whole.
//
// The key is what carries that decision across the process boundary. A turn that
// stamps the room's own session shares the room's live region; a turn that stamps
// a companion suffix gets its own admission test on the surface
// (internal/tui2/chat/companion.go); a turn that takes the observer OFF says it
// must never be drawn as speech at all.
//
// These are pinned here, at the emitter, because the surface cannot tell the
// difference between a key it was never sent and a key it decided to drop — and
// the failure looks identical either way: the answer appears whole.

// streamProbe is a client that reports what the context it was called on would
// do with a delta. It is the only honest way to ask the question: the observer
// and the session are both context values, and Emit is the door every real
// emitter goes through.
