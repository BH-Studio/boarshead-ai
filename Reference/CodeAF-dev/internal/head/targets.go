// What stood here was the single door between a ROUTED decision and the journal:
// one command, chosen as the terminal act of a turn that could not revisit it,
// with the optimistic reply worded before the row existed. The law at that door
// — the reply is posted on the far side of a journaled row or it is never posted
// at all — survives entirely, and it is now the law of every acting tool: a tool
// that could not journal returns an error the loop must speak to, and a tool
// that did returns what it did. What is gone is the door's monopoly.
//
// The candidate reader below survives too. A verb that knows what it wants to do
// and not what to do it to is still an ordinary thing to say, and the union of
// "live jobs the words reach" and "standing rules the words reach" is still the
// only honest answer to it. It is a READ now: the control tool hands the list
// back to the loop, which names the ids, rather than posting a question the loop
// would then talk over.

// describedTarget is one thing a verb with no target could have meant: a job on
// the board, or a standing rule. The two are matched by machinery that already
// exists and answers the same question in its own half of the world; this only
// puts the two answers in one list, because the person asking "stand down the
// stretch reminder" did not say which half they were pointing at and should not
// have to.

// trusts: the surgery search over live work, and the charter search over

// answer — the mapping below is the store's own table, not a guess — so a
