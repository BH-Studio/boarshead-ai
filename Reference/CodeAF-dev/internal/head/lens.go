// The lens: three reads that make the journal total.
//
// It lives in internal/head rather than in a package of its own for one reason
// and it is temporary — these reads need the Head's store handle and every
// renderer already written against it (renderPlan, renderResult's shape,
// resultChildren, artifact.go's boundary, jobResult's continuation chase), and
// moving them out before they exist would mean either exporting a dozen
// renderers or writing them twice. The August 2026 chat-simplification audit,
// no longer in the tree, proposed in Part 3.7 that this file move to internal/lens
// wholesale, with the renderers it leans on; nothing here is meant to stay
// under a package whose name says "head".
//
// What the three reads are FOR is the product rule in Part 0.4: if the store
// knows it, the conversation can surface it. Today's eleven reads leave two
// holes that nothing patches — a running step's own progress reaches the TUI
// and nothing else, and the system's own state is split across three tools and
// a pane — and every one of them cuts its answer at a byte ceiling written when
// truncation was the safety mechanism. So:
//
//   - recall(q, kind?, since?, until?, session?) — one search over everything
//     settled or said, blending the five FTS surfaces and settled history, each
//     hit carrying real bytes and an id that open takes.
//   - open(id, job?, part?, raw?) — one thing whole and state-aware: a running
//     job's plan with live per-step status and its progress feed, a finished
//     job's whole result, a file's actual bytes, a rule, a service, a belief.
//     raw:true hands back the journal rows underneath it, unredacted.
//   - status() — the whole system on one page.
//
// The byte ceilings do not come with them. These three PAGE: a read past one
// transport page says exactly which part of how many it is holding and how to
// ask for the next, so the loop is never handed a fragment it believes is the
// whole. The old reads keep their caps, because those caps are load-bearing for
// prompts that carry a board and a thread beside them; these are reads the loop
// chose, and a read the loop chose is worth its bytes.
