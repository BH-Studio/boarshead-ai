// The re-entry brief, and the alive glance (the August 2026 chat-simplification
// audit, no longer in the tree, J4 and J5).
//
// A thread is a working conversation: alive for days, commissioning tasks along
// the way, taking their results back, and resumable after weeks. What made
// resuming one feel like starting over was not memory — the thread window has
// always carried the recent transcript — but ARC. The head could read the last
// few messages and had no way to say what the conversation was FOR, what it had
// set going, or what was still hanging; so it answered the new message from a
// standing start while the person carried the whole history in their head.
//
// This file is the projection that closes that gap, and its most important
// property is what it does NOT do:
//
//   - It costs no provider call. Every line is read off the journal — the room's
//     title, its opening ask, the jobs its own splices stamped with it, the
//     artifacts its messages referenced, the end of the transcript. A brief that
//     had to be composed would be a second of silence in front of the first
//     answer after every gap, which is exactly where a conversation can least
//     afford one.
//   - It stores nothing. There is no brief table and no cached arc: the journal
//     is the record and this is a read over it, so a brief is correct after a
//     rebuild for the same reason the transcript is.
//   - It says only what it can derive. The v1 arc is structural, and the one
//     judgment in it — what is still OPEN — is decided by the shape of the
//     thread's end rather than by reading its meaning. Being honestly narrow is
//     the point: the model is the party that turns this into a sentence, and it
//     does that better from four true facts than from a paragraph of guesswork.

// The byte numbers here are floors now rather than ceilings: this is what
// they get on a window nobody could size, and budget.go raises them in
// proportion on a window with room to spare.
