// Four jobs speaking into one thread is the ordinary case, and until now every
// model that had to resolve "it", "that one" or "the auth fix" was shown a
// conversation in which all four spoke in one undifferentiated voice. The TUI
// has always drawn the attribution — a faint chip over every job-anchored line —
// and the head, which is the party that actually has to decide what the user
// means, was handed the same lines with the anchor stripped off.
//
// The name is the one the user already reads on screen: the job's short human
// title, the same string the cards and the receipts use. It is never an id.
// Deixis only resolves when the person and the model are looking at the same
// names, so a second vocabulary — task-3171, node ids, anything from backstage —
// would be worse than no vocabulary at all.

// jobNames resolves the node a line was spoken by to the job that node belongs
// to, memoised for the length of one render. A job is a root and its parts, so
// several lines in one window routinely resolve to the same title and the walk
// is worth doing once.
