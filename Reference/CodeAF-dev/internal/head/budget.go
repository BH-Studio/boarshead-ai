import "github.com/Agent-Field/codeaf/internal/ctxbudget"

// One pot, computed once, for a prompt that is built again from nothing every
// single turn.
//
// Every block the head assembles used to carry a byte ceiling of its own,
// written as a literal and argued for in prose beside it. Added up they came to
// about twenty-two kilobytes, and that was the head's prompt whether the model
// behind it held a hundred and thirty thousand tokens or a million: the window
// grew tenfold and the thread was still cut at eight kilobytes, because nothing
// in this package had ever been told how big the window was. The head was not
// being frugal, it was being uninformed.
//
// So the literals stay exactly where they are and stop being ceilings. Each one
// is now the FALLBACK for its block — what that block gets when nobody told the
// head what model it speaks through — and the ceiling itself is a weighted share
// of one pot ctxbudget derives from the window. The weights are today's own
// proportions, so the shape of a turn — what matters more than what — is the
// one thing the window cannot change, and a window that prices a block at what
// it already had leaves it exactly there.
//
// Nothing shrinks. A share that lands under its own fallback loses to it, so a
// small window is exactly the head that shipped before this law and a large one
// is the same head with room. On the hundred-and-twenty-eight-thousand-token
// models most talk slots run, the reserve the law keeps for reasoning is most of
// the window and every block does floor to its literal — which is the honest
// answer, not a missed opportunity: there was never any room to hand out. The
// windows that have room are the ones that get it.
//
// And every number here is a CEILING rather than a purchase: the thread block is
// twenty messages long whatever the budget says, and a room that has not filled
// eight kilobytes does not start filling eighty. What the budget buys is that
// the truncation stops firing on a model that had room to spare.

	// headFixedFloorTokens is the measured cost of everything in a head turn
	// that is not budgeted material: the orchestrator system prompt (11KB as
	// written) and the belt's tool schemas (14KB of JSON), with the clock, the
	// rail line and the hints on top. It is stated rather than measured per turn
	// because the pot is computed once, at construction — a budget that moved
	// between turns would move the front of the prompt with it, and the front of
	// this prompt holding still is what the whole cache-shape argument rests on.

	// headBudgetTotal is the denominator every weight below is out of, and the
	// thing being divided is ONE TURN rather than one prompt.
	//
	// That distinction is the whole of why the weights look small. A turn opens
	// with its ambient prompt — thread, board, depth, notebook, re-entry, about
	// twenty-two kilobytes of it — and then spends up to orchestratorToolCallCap
	// tool calls whose results land in the same window and stay there. Sixteen
	// reads at the size the read literals argue for come to well over a hundred
	// kilobytes, so the prompt the turn opens with is about a sixth of what the
	// turn actually costs, and the reads are the rest.
	//
	// Weighting the reads against the ambient prompt instead — a bash page as
	// seventy percent of "the pot" — reads plausibly and is a trap: it holds on
	// a window where every read floors to its literal, and on a large one it
	// prices sixteen reads at ten times the window they have to fit in. So the
	// denominator is the turn, every weight is that block's share of one, and a
	// turn that spends its whole belt on average-sized reads comes out at
	// exactly the pot on any window at all.
