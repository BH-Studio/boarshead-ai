// stop: withdraw something.
//
// It stays its own verb rather than folding into change (the August 2026
// chat-simplification audit, no longer in the tree, §4.2)
// because withdrawal is definite and consent-gated: a destructive intent
// deserves an unambiguous door, and a gate that fires on a sentence the judge
// was still interpreting would be a gate on nothing.
//
// One tool covers four kinds because the person's intent is one intent: they
// point at things they own and say stop. What "stop" means for each kind is the
// store's own vocabulary — cancel work, retire a rule or a learned way, stop a
// service — and the only reading taken from the words is whether they want it
// HELD rather than ended, which the two kinds that support holding honour and
// the two that do not ignore.
//
// The consent machinery is untouched and reached by the same road control used:
// beltSet resolves the ids over their open subtrees under the store's legality
// table, classImpact prices the whole set once, surgeryNeedsConfirmation decides,
// and journalUnits is the single commit path. Nothing about the gate knows this
// tool is new.

// stopEverythingTarget is how the total withdrawal is named. It is a reserved
// word rather than an argument because it is the one stop that is not about ids
// at all — it reaches every service the person is running, and asks once about
// the live work. Exactly one spelling is reserved, and deliberately: "all" is a
// word a person might plausibly have called something.
