// The correction that names its work in its own words wins over the job that
// merely spoke most recently. Before this, adjacency led and returned on its
// first hit, so the vocabulary arm was unreachable whenever anything had
// narrated — and a correction aimed at the auth fix bought a paid revision of
// whatever job happened to have a heartbeat in the window.
//
// The anchor is the one referent no board read resolves — a delivered job is
// over — so it is computed before the loop runs and put in front of it as
// evidence. Acting on it is the correct tool, which hands the job its own
// previous version and the criticism together.
