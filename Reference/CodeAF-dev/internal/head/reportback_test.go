// 13.10's producer half, taken at the head end — and now the other side of the
// handshake it left.
//
// The voice used to tell the head that a commission's receipt says "you will
// report back", and nothing in the machinery could keep it: `announceNode`
// posts a delivery as a SYSTEM row anchored to a node, and `answerable` — the
// predicate the poll consulted — takes a row only when it is the person's own
// and belongs to no node. So the head said "I'll let you know when it lands"
// and then never spoke again. That wave closed the honesty half by deleting the
// promise; this one closes the wiring half, which is the arm that actually gives
// the person what the report asked for.
//
// The wake is `deliveredRow` and the turn is absorb.go. `answerable` is
// deliberately UNCHANGED: a delivery is not the person's own contiguous words
// and must never be folded into a run of them, which is what widening that
// predicate would have done.
//
// So the voice may promise to come back with what work FINDS — that promise is
// now backed, and so is coming back with what the workforce makes of a CHANGE,
// since the receipt wakes the head too (wake.go). The promises it may not make
// are the ones nothing in the belt can keep: opening a file, watching something,
// speaking on another channel.
//
// The lexical enforcement that used to stand behind this — promise.go, three cue
// lists and a re-ask over every reply that tripped one — is gone. It was scanning
// for a sentence the machinery had learned to keep, and the two wakes plus
// run.summary() are what keep the honest half now: a receipt can only say what a
// tool reported, and a promise to speak again is a promise something actually
// executes. This test pins the words and the wiring together, so the voice and
// the machinery can never again disagree about what the head is able to do.
// §7. A one-sentence question got twenty-one lines with four bold headers and
// eight bullets, and every single turn ended with "Want me to …?". Neither is a
// capability limit — the same head answers a recall question in one line — so
// both are stated as principles and neither as a rule with a case list.
//
// What this pins is that the calibration is stated, and that it is stated
// WITHOUT a worked example: the offer's own model sentence used to sit in the
// prompt, which is a template to copy in the one place the failure was
// copying. The campaign removes case law rather than adding to it.
