// The one tool-loop head.
//
// What used to be here was three things pretending to be one: ten deterministic
// recognizers that answered terminally, a tool loop reachable only behind a
// keyword trigger, and a router that could emit exactly one command as the last
// act of a turn it could not revisit. The head could not read the board, decide,
// spawn and report in one breath; it could not spawn at all except as a router's
// terminal decision; and the prompt above all of it said "it never plans or
// executes work" while the belt below cancelled, steered and revised.
//
// This is the replacement, in one wave rather than by absorption, because two
// brains coexisting mid-flight is the disease rather than a step away from it
// (Part 6 decision 5). One prompt. One belt. One board renderer. One thread
// renderer. The recognizers survive as pre-answers in the prompt (hints.go) and
// as the bodies of the tools that act; nothing they used to decide silently is
// decided silently now.

	//
	// It used to be eight, DIVIDED — six of them for looking, the last two held
	// back for acting — because a turn could not pause, report and continue. A
	// diagnosis that spent eight calls investigating reached the end of its belt
	// holding the answer and no hands, and said "I've commissioned a fix" over a
	// turn that had commissioned nothing. The division was the cheapest guard
	// available against that, and it bought it by making every read-only turn six
	// reads wide whether or not the question needed twelve.
	//
	// Two things replace it. The loop can now SAY something mid-turn (acts.go)
	// rather than saving its breath for the end, and a command it journals wakes
	// it when the receipt settles (wake.go) — so the turn that ran out of belt
	// mid-diagnosis is no longer the turn that has to both find and fix. What is
	// left is one number, and it is generous: sixteen calls is a real
	// investigation with its hands still free, and it still bounds a model that
	// will not stop calling tools. One sentence can never become an open tab.
	//
	// What reaching it MEANS changed once more (narrow.go): the belt narrows to
	// the work verbs rather than emptying, because a turn whose campaign outgrew
	// it has somewhere to put the campaign and used to have nowhere.

	// rather than what is gone — the turn is one round from over and a model
	// spending it mourning its reads is a turn spent on nothing.
