// A finished job says what it found in two places, and until now the head could
// only reach one of them. The node's summary is what the worker chose to type;
// the file beside it is what the worker actually wrote. depth.go already says as
// much in its own words — "the file path beside it is how a document is read" —
// while no reader existed anywhere in the process. So the head, asked "what is
// the answer?", could see a path, offer to go and look, and then not go, because
// there was nowhere for it to go. It made a promise the machine could not keep,
// which is worse than saying it did not know. This file is the reader that makes
// the offer honest.
//
// It is a security boundary, and the boundary is drawn by the graph rather than
// by the filesystem. The only bytes this can return come from a path the graph
// itself points at — a job's fold pointers and the paths its own settled summary
// names. A path the model invents, a path the user types, a path one directory
// across from a real artifact: none of them is openable, because the argument
// the caller passes is only ever used to CHOOSE among recorded paths, never to
// build one. Whatever is asked for, what gets opened is an entry from that
// recorded set and nothing else.
//
// The second half of the boundary is that a recorded path must still be what it
// looked like when it was recorded. It is resolved through every symlink and
// required to land in the directory it was recorded in, so an artifact name that
// is really a link out of the workspace opens nothing. Nothing here writes, and
// nothing here journals a command: like board, manual and result, it is a read.

// The byte numbers here are floors now rather than ceilings: this is what
// they get on a window nobody could size, and budget.go raises them in
// proportion on a window with room to spare.
