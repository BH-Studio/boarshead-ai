// read thread:// — one conversation reads another, on demand and never
// otherwise (8.2.10, amending the 5.7 knowledge contract).
//
// 5.7 draws the knowledge contract tightly on purpose: the main head does not
// see task transcripts AMBIENTLY, because a head that carried every room's
// conversation in every prompt would pay for all of them on every message and
// would answer this room's question with that room's context. 8.2.10 amends the
// contract in one direction only — an explicit, on-demand READ — and 12.5's
// scorecard names it as one of the four repairs that failed session owed:
// "head unable to re-read its own transcript".
//
// Every property here follows from "on demand, never ambient":
//
//   - It is a TOOL, so it costs a call and appears in the turn's own record. It
//     is not spliced into the prompt, it is not retrieved against the message,
//     and a turn that does not ask for it pays nothing.
//   - It is SESSION-SCOPED. What it can reach is the rooms of this person's own
//     journal, listed by the read itself, so an id is something the model saw
//     rather than something it composed. The room it is already standing in is
//     refused: that transcript is the thread block at the top of the prompt, and
//     spending a tool call to be handed it a second time is the fold-stop bug
//     the window machinery exists to prevent.
//   - It is BOUNDED, twice: the newest transcriptTurnCap turns, and a byte
//     ceiling inside that. A read of a day-long room is a summary of its end,
//     which is what "what were we saying in there" means.
//   - It is SANITIZED. These bytes were written by another room's model and by
//     workers' output, and they land in a prompt and then in a transcript. The
//     chokepoint every other body crosses is not optional for the one body that
//     arrives from somewhere else.

// The byte numbers here are floors now rather than ceilings: this is what
// they get on a window nobody could size, and budget.go raises them in
// proportion on a window with room to spare.
