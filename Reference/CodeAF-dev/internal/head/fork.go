// fork-this-conversation-into-a-task (8.2.12): "take what we just discussed and
// go do it."
//
// 8.2.12 is explicit that this is a SPAWN VARIANT, not a new mechanism, and that
// is the whole of the design. Everything that makes commissioning work safe —
// the fan-out cap, the consequence gate applied at the journaling door, the
// dedupe, the receipt assembled from what was actually journaled, the person's
// words travelling verbatim — lives inside the spawn tool, and a second door
// beside it would be a second set of those guards to keep in step. So this
// composes the instruction and then calls spawn, once. If a guard changes, it
// changes here too, because there is no "here".
//
// What it adds is the one thing spawn cannot do: carry the conversation. A
// spawned job sees its instruction and nothing else, which is right — a worker
// with the whole chat in its brief is a worker optimizing for the chat. But a
// person who has spent ten minutes settling what they want and then says "okay,
// go do it" has put the requirements in the conversation, and an instruction
// that arrives without them is a job that asks all of it again.
//
// The context travels as its OWN FIELD rather than pasted in as more
// instruction, because the two are not the same authority: the goal is what
// they asked for, and the transcript is evidence about what they meant. A
// worker that reads a passing remark as an order is the failure this framing
// exists to prevent — and so is a recognizer that reads the transcript as the
// ask, which is what it did for as long as the two shared one string (ask.go).

// The byte numbers here are floors now rather than ceilings: this is what
// they get on a window nobody could size, and budget.go raises them in
// proportion on a window with room to spare.

// ForkedContextPrefix opens the inherited block in a pre-split instruction. It
// is the store's constant because the store is what reads old journal rows, and
// it stays named here because this is where the fence was minted for as long as
// there was a fence to mint.
//
// NOTHING WRITES IT ANY MORE. The two halves travel as two typed fields on the
// command (store.Command.Instruction and .Context), which is the whole of this
// fix: a fence in one string is only a fence to a reader that looks for it, and
// every reader downstream was reading the string as the person's own words. The
// composition still exists — store.Command.Brief — but it exists for the ONE
// consumer that is entitled to both halves, the compiler.

// not only cheaper: the window is the fold the head has already decided is this
// conversation, so the work inherits what the head was actually reasoning over
// rather than a second, differently-bounded opinion about the same room.
