// properly" — and the split stamp saying its remainder had been re-planned. The
// continuation landed a minute later saying the opposite: everything verified,
// the browser builds and launches. A hundred seconds after that the user asked
// how it was going and the head narrated the parent's half-sentence in the
// present tense, as though the conflict were still open and nothing had followed
// it. Nothing was running; the person watching could see that.
