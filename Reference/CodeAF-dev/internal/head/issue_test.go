// won't fire anymore while the rule stays active. The head made a claim about

//
// What must happen instead is not an error message. The thread named the thing,
// the store can address it, and the honest outcome is the act: a command row
// against that rule, a receipt tied to that row, and a status that has moved by
// the time the reconciler has run. The verb no longer arrives as a router's
// terminal decision — it is the stop tool, aimed at the rule id a read handed
// over — and the sentence is allowed on screen for exactly one reason: the row
// underneath it makes it true.
