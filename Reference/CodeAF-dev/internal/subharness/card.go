// THE PREVIEW CARD: the one rendering of a harness, and the thing a person
// actually approves.
//
// A sub-harness is built in conversation, which means the shape arrives as JSON
// a model wrote. Nobody approves JSON. What somebody can approve is a plain
// account of what will happen, in the order it happens, with the choices and
// the rounds and the checks written where they occur — because the question
// being asked is not "is this valid", it is "is this what I meant", and that
// question is answered by reading the order of events.

// ── NOT ONE WORD OF MACHINERY ──
//
// This card once printed the node KIND beside every step — `agent.loop`,
// `parallel.split`, `verify` — plus `width 3`, `join all`, `invariants`, and
// the raw tool ids off each node's whitelist slice. Every one of those is a name
// for something inside this binary, and the person being asked to keep the
// recipe has never seen inside this binary. They read a column of vocabulary
// that could only be understood by somebody who did not need the card.
//
// So STRUCTURE IS SHOWN AND NEVER NAMED. A fan-out is a heading and an indent;
// a choice is `if …` and `otherwise`; a bounded loop is `repeat until … (up to
// 3 times)`; a gather prints NOTHING AT ALL, because the outdent back to the
// main flow is already what it means and a row saying "join" would be a row
// about the drawing rather than about the work. The one presentation table on
// this page ([cardToolWords]) turns a belt tool's registered name into what it does,
// and falls through to the name itself for anything it has never heard of.
//
// ── THE STEPS ARE THE RUN'S OWN ORDER ──
//
// A program is a DAG with its edges written down (registry.go), and the walk
// that runs it is a topological one (run.go) — so the card is numbered in that
// same order and a person reading it top to bottom has read the run. NUMBERS
// BELONG TO THE MAIN FLOW ONLY. Anything reachable exclusively through one lane
// of a fan-out or one arm of a choice is drawn once, nested under the thing that
// opens it, with a dim bullet instead of a number: it is not a step of the run,
// it is a step of that lane, and a flat numbered list said otherwise.
//
// ONE RENDERER, EVERY SURFACE. The chat tool prints these lines into a tool
// result, the TUI panel draws the same lines into a block, and a test asserts
// against them. A second rendering would be a second thing that could disagree
// with the program it claims to describe — and the approval is given against
// what was drawn, not against what was stored.

const (
	// cardDetailCap bounds one step's detail. A brief is paragraphs; a card row
	// is a row, and the whole brief is one `show` away. It is smaller than it
	// was because the row now starts at an indent, and a detail sized for
	// column zero would run off the edge of every nested lane.
	cardDetailCap = 56

	// cardStep is one nesting level, in spaces. Indentation is the ONLY thing
	// this card has for depth — no box drawing, no rules, no borders — so it is
	// generous enough to be read at a glance and identical at every level.
	cardStep = 5

	// cardNameCap bounds the column a step's name is padded to. One column for
	// the whole card rather than one per level, so the details line up down the
	// page; a name longer than this simply pushes its own detail along rather
	// than dragging every other row right with it.

// what does it, which is this card's whole law about structure.

// cardOtherwiseWord is a choice's second arm. exec.go's branch takes the FIRST
// successor when the condition holds and the SECOND when it does not, so these
// two words are the run's real behaviour and not a convention of the drawing.
const cardOtherwiseWord = "otherwise"

// cardNeverWord labels an arm past the second. exec.go picks between exactly
// two, so a third edge out of a choice is a shape nothing will ever walk —
// and a card that quietly drew it as another `otherwise` would be hiding the
// one fact a person needs in order to notice the mistake.
const cardNeverWord = "never taken"

// cardToolWords is the ONE presentation table on this card: a tool's registered
// name beside what it DOES, in the words of somebody who has never read this
// repository. The names are the harness belt's own (session's harness_belt.go —
// the seven wire tools, the media family, and the cutting verb), because that is
// the entire set a whitelist may legally hold. A verb that joins that belt and
// not this table prints its own identifier on a page a person is being asked to
// approve, which is why internal/session holds a test that reads the whole belt
// back against this table (harness_card_words_test.go).
//
// It is presentation and nothing else. No behaviour reads it, no whitelist is
// checked against it, and a name it has never heard of falls through to itself
// rather than to a shrug — which is the whole reason a table is acceptable here:
// the card has to survive a whitelist naming a verb this build does not have,
// and that is precisely the page a person most needs to be able to read.
//
// TWO FORMS, because one call and one permission are different sentences. A
// fixed tool call does a thing once ("runs a command"); a loop step is ALLOWED a
// thing for as long as it runs ("runs commands").
