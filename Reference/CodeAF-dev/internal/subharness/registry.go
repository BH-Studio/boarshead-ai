// Package subharness is the registry of node kinds a sub-harness is built
// from, and the durable home of the sub-harnesses themselves.
//
// A sub-harness is a registry entry, not generated code: identity, a program
// that is a DAG over the node kinds below, a tool whitelist, a verification
// rung, a dynamism rung with its budget, and tests. The kinds are a
// library-in-binary — `agent.loop` is the session loop this binary already
// runs, `tool.call` is the tool call it already makes — so a saved harness is
// a small, inspectable arrangement of machinery that exists, and never a
// program the resident has to compile.
//
// Two ladders run through everything here, both adopted from the Agent-Field
// skill and both carried as an argument rather than a design:
//
//   - Verification: accept < schema < invariants < loop < report < rederive <
//     adversarial < human. How hard a run's output has to work to be believed.
//   - Dynamism: fixed < branch < width < meta < recursive < selfmod. How much
//     shape a run is allowed to decide for itself, with an integer Cap that is
//     the budget for deciding it.
//
// The dynamism rung is enforced against the program: a `fixed` harness may not
// contain a `branch` node, a harness that never declared `recursive` may not
// call another sub-harness. That is the whole point of writing the rung down —
// a harness cannot quietly become more autonomous than its author said.
//
// Version is a pointer. v1, v2, v3 are immutable pages under the harness's own
// directory, and opening a pointer again reads the same page it read before;
// see store.go. Design: docs/SUBHARNESS.md.
