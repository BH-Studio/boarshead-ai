// DETECTION: which harness, if any, the person just asked for.
//
// A sub-harness has no slash command. The way to run one is to say what you
// want, which means something has to decide — every turn, before the model is
// sent anything — whether what was said is one of the things this build already
// knows how to do properly.
//
// THAT DECISION IS A TABLE LOOKUP, NOT A JUDGEMENT. There is no model call
// here, no embedding, no cache to warm: [Score] is a pure function of a turn's
// text and one entry's own words, and it returns the same number today, in a
// test, and on a machine with no network. Three reasons, in the order they
// matter:
//
//   - A MODEL CALL PER TURN IS A TAX ON EVERY TURN. Most turns are not a
//     harness. Paying a small model to say so, before the real model has been
//     sent anything, would put latency and a bill on the ordinary case to serve
//     the rare one.
//   - A QUESTION A PERSON DID NOT ASK FOR MUST BE PREDICTABLE. This produces a
//     card that interrupts what somebody was doing. A card that appears for a
//     sentence and not for the same sentence tomorrow is worse than no card,
//     because there is nothing to learn about when it happens.
//   - THE DESIGNER ALREADY KNOWS. The cues are written at build time by whoever
//     wrote the harness. Asking a model to re-derive at runtime what a person
//     wrote down at build time is paying for an answer we already have.
//
// The cost of that choice is recall, and the first real runs showed how the
// bill arrives: a goal scored 0.42 against THE HARNESS THAT GOAL BUILT. The
// designer's cue list was written in the designer's words, the goal was written
// in the person's, and nothing connected them. Two answers to that, and this
// file holds both:
//
//   - [SeedCues] derives a cue list from the goal itself, so a harness is
//     always reachable by the words that built it. Nothing about matching is
//     loosened to get there; the vocabulary is simply no longer left empty.
//   - The scorer reads a designer's PHRASE as a phrase — whole (0.9), or most
//     of it (0.6) — and a lone word as the coincidence it usually is (0.45).
//
// A missed offer still costs a person nothing — they get the ordinary turn they
// were always going to get — and a wrong offer still costs them a question. The
// numbers below are set on that asymmetry and nothing else.

// The decision Best makes, in three numbers.
//
//   - Threshold is the score at which one match stands on its own. It is met,
//     not exceeded: 0.55 is the number one whole phrase clears and one lone
//     word does not.
//   - ClearWinner is the other way in. A registry is a field of candidates, and
//     an entry that is a quarter of the scale ahead of everything else is the
//     answer to the question even when it is a middling score in absolute
//     terms. With one entry in the registry the runner-up is 0 and this rule is
//     the whole of the decision — which is right: a build with one harness has
//     nothing else the sentence could have meant.
//   - Floor is the line under which neither rule may reach. Below 0.40 the
//     evidence is a word or two of prose overlap, and a card raised on that is
//     the card that teaches people to say no without reading.
const (
	Threshold   = 0.55
	ClearWinner = 0.25
	Floor       = 0.40
)

// The evidence weights. Each is how much ONE signal moves the score on its own,
// and they combine as independent evidence — score = 1 − Π(1 − w) — so a second
// signal always helps and no amount of weak evidence ever quite reaches
// certainty.
//
// They are set so that the rungs sort like this:
//
//   - NAMING THE HARNESS FIRES ALONE (0.9). "run the research harness" is not a
//     guess about what somebody meant; it is what they said. A name is a name
//     even without the word harness beside it: harnesses are named by the goals
//     that built them, so a turn that lands one is a turn that said the thing.
//   - ONE WHOLE PHRASE CUE FIRES ALONE (0.9). A designer's multi-word cue
//     landing verbatim is the designer's own sentence coming back.
//   - MOST OF A PHRASE ALMOST FIRES (0.6). Two of the three words of "strongest
//     counterargument addressed", in order, is the same request rephrased —
//     strong enough to want one more signal, not strong enough alone.
//   - ONE SINGLE-WORD CUE NEVER FIRES ALONE (0.45). "research" is a word people
//     use about work they are doing themselves. Two of them do fire (0.70).
//
// The description is half-weighted (0.5) because it is prose written for a
// person to read, not a trigger list: its overlap corroborates a cue and must
// never carry a match by itself. Even a description quoted back word for word
// scores 0.5 alone, which is under the threshold — as it should be, since a
// person who wanted the harness had every chance to use one of its cues.

// SeedCues derives a harness's trigger vocabulary from the goal that built it:
// the phrases in that sentence which say what the work IS, ranked, four to eight
// of them, and every one of them a run of words the goal itself contains.
//
// It exists because of the hole a real run found. A designer writes cues in the
// designer's vocabulary; the person types the goal in theirs; and the harness
// built for that exact sentence scored 0.42 against it. Seeding from the goal
// closes that by construction — the sentence that commissioned a harness always
// reaches it — and every paraphrase of that sentence inherits the same phrases
// minus a word or two, which is what [nearly] is for.
//
// WHAT IT LOOKS FOR is contiguous spans of two to four words that begin and end
// on a word carrying meaning, hold at most one function word in the middle, and
// stay inside one clause — "adopt a component model", "ad hoc views", "small
// open weight llms". A span that opens on a verb of work scores higher, because
// a verb-object pair is what a person retypes when they want the same job done
// again. Punctuation is a wall: nothing spans the em dash in "views —
// investigate", because those are two different things being asked for.
