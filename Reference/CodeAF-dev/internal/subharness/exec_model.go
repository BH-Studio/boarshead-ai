// THE MODEL BRIDGE: the one [Env] that is neither a test script nor a session.
//
// exec.go says what every kind MEANS and leaves the doing to an Env. A session
// implements that Env over the belt it already has — its loop, its tools, its
// consent lane — and that is the implementation a person in a conversation
// wants. This file is the other one: an Env with nothing behind it but a
// provider client and two closures, so that a harness can be run by anything
// that has a model, with no session in the process at all.
//
// It is deliberately the SMALL implementation, and the smallness is the design:
//
//   - AN agent.loop IS ONE COMPLETION WHEN THE STEP HAS NO TOOLS, AND A REAL
//     BOUNDED TOOL LOOP WHEN IT HAS SOME. A step that names no tools has nothing
//     to do between requests, so its brief and what its predecessors produced go
//     up as one request and `max_turns` is stated to the worker as the effort it
//     was budgeted rather than spent as rounds. A step that NAMES tools is handed
//     them and actually runs them. The other reading — telling a worker "you
//     cannot call them here, say what you would run" — is what this file used to
//     do, and it produced runs where every node answered with a command nobody
//     executed and a report that was honest about nothing.
//
//     THAT IS STILL NOT A SECOND SESSION LOOP, and the distinction is the whole
//     reason it may live here. The rounds are the provider client's own
//     ([provider.Client.ExecuteToolCallLoop]), which the adapter already carries
//     over its own transport: send the belt, dispatch what the model asked for,
//     feed the result back, stop at a text answer or at the ceiling. What this
//     file adds is a message pair, an intersection with the whitelist and a
//     dispatcher — no transcript, no compaction, no consent lane, no second
//     implementation of any of them (registry.go: the library-in-binary). A
//     harness that needs those is run by the session, which has them.
//   - EVERY JUDGEMENT IS A SEPARATE, TINY CALL. A verify asks one question and
//     wants one word back; a free-text condition asks one question and wants
//     yes or no. Neither is given the run's whole history to reason over — they
//     are given the trail, clipped, which is the evidence a person reading the
//     saved run would have.
//   - NOTHING HERE DECIDES SHAPE. The branch law, the loop's rounds, the gate's
//     three answers and the dynamism budget are all exec.go's and run.go's,
//     unchanged. This file answers questions; it never picks a successor, which
//     is why a program run through this bridge leaves the same trace it would
//     leave anywhere else.
//   - A CALL IS A WHOLE RUN, on a bridge derived from this one. A harness that
//     names another does not get it inlined: the child is walked by [Run] with
//     its own bridge, its own whitelist and its own trace, and what comes back is
//     a summary. That is the same smallness — there is one way to run a harness,
//     and nesting reuses it rather than growing a second one (see [modelEnv.call]
//     for the three refusals that keep the recursion finite).
//
// ── WHAT A GATE MEANS WITH NOBODY THERE ──
//
// [ModelExecOpts.Ask] nil is a surface with no one to ask, and a human.gate
// under it AUTO-APPROVES and says so in the trail. That is the same bargain
// consent.go keeps for a headless run: the honest answers are "refuse" and "I
// said in advance this may run", and a caller wiring this bridge into an
// unattended runner has already said the second by handing over no Ask at all.
// A caller that has somebody to ask hands one over, and then the gate's three
// answers are real — with the caveat that a DECLINE ends a plain [Run] as a
// failure, because Run has only an error to end on. A caller that wants the
// declined and intervened statuses spelled out drives the same environment
// through a [Runner] instead.

// modelClip bounds one earlier output where it is quoted into a prompt. It is
// generous — a step's output is the evidence the next step works from — and it
// exists so that a harness whose second node produced a megabyte does not send
// that megabyte to every node after it.
const modelClip = 8000

// callClip bounds what a child's own answer contributes to the row its caller
// leaves. It is far tighter than modelClip because the parent's trail is a
// SUMMARY of the call — the child's whole run is saved in the child's own
// history, and a caller's row that carried it twice would make a two-deep run
// read as the same evidence pasted twice.
const callClip = 1200

// modelMaxTurns is what an agent.loop that declares no max_turns is told it has
// when the caller named no default either.
const modelMaxTurns = 8

// modelCallsPerTurn is how many tool calls a step may spend for each turn it was
// budgeted, and it exists because the two ceilings measure different things. A
// turn is one round trip; a turn may carry several tool calls at once, and an
// endpoint that batches three reads into one round trip has not spent three
// turns. Three per turn is the ratio at which the call ceiling stops being the
// binding limit for ordinary work while still bounding the pathological case —
// a model that asks for twenty greps in one breath — at a number a person
// reading the trace can multiply in their head.
const modelCallsPerTurn = 3

// modelToolOutput is the one key a dispatched tool's text travels under between
// [Toolbelt.Call] and the provider's loop, which speaks in maps. It is unwrapped
// again by [loopToolPrompts] before the model sees it.

// is a belt that can be advertised and never run; a dispatcher with no
// definitions is a belt nothing can ask for. Either half on its own is a bridge
// that lies to the model about what it can reach, so they arrive together or not
// at all — and a zero Toolbelt is the same honest absence a nil
// [ModelExecOpts.RunTool] already is: the step is told its tools are named and
// not callable, and makes one completion.
//
// IT IS NOT [ModelExecOpts.RunTool] AND DOES NOT REPLACE IT. A tool.call is the
// FIXED half of the library (kinds.go) — its arguments are the page's own and no
// model ever touches them — so it keeps its own closure with its own fixed-string
// signature. A surface wires both to the same execution path, which is what makes
