// Running a sub-harness is a walk of its program, not an interpretation of it.
// This package owns the shape — what runs next, what a branch skipped, how
// many rounds a loop was allowed — and hands each node to an Exec that owns
// the work. That split is why there is no second engine here: the caller's
// Exec is the session loop, the tool call, the ask; the walk is the only thing
// a sub-harness adds.
//
// What the walk produces is the run's evidence. A Trace is a condensed dag:
// the Trail is what actually executed, in order, and Edges are the edges that
// were actually taken — so a branch that went right leaves a trace with no
// left edge in it, and the run's shape can be read back without re-deriving it
// from the program.

// Result is one node's outcome, as its executor reports it.

	// Out is the node's output, condensed for the trail. The full artifact
	// belongs wherever the executor keeps artifacts; what lands here is what a
	// person reading the run needs to see.

	// Next is a branch node's choice: the id of the one successor to take.
	// Empty means the first successor in program order. Ignored by every other

	// Status is how the run ended in one word (exec.go). The walk fills in the
	// two it can tell apart on its own — ok and failed — and a [Runner] refines
	// it with the three that are somebody else's news: a person declined at a
	// gate, took the run over, or the context died. It is a field rather than a
	// reading of Err because "a person said no" is not a failure, and a history
	// that could only spell it as one would punish the gate for working.
	Status Status `json:"status,omitempty"`

// says Done, bounded by both its own max_rounds and what is left of the
// harness's dynamism budget — the run stops deciding when the budget is gone,
// it does not fail.
