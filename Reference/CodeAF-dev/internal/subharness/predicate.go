// CONDITIONS: the tiny language a branch and a loop are steered by.
//
// It is deliberately not an expression language. The control layer of a
// sub-harness is DATA — the same law craft's workflows live under — and the
// moment a file can compute, a file can be wrong in ways nobody reading the card
// would see. So there are seven words, they all ask about ONE thing (what the
// step before this one produced, and whether it succeeded), and anything a
// person would want to express beyond them belongs in an agent.loop node's
// brief, where it is visible as a question somebody asked rather than as syntax.
//
//	always            take this arm
//	never             never take it — a case kept in the file but turned off
//	ok                the step before this one succeeded
//	failed            it did not
//	empty             it produced nothing
//	nonempty          it produced something
//	contains <text>   its output holds that text, case-insensitively
//	equals <text>     its output IS that text, trimmed and case-insensitively
//	matches <regexp>  its output matches
//
// The two-word forms take the REST of the line verbatim, quotes and all: a
// condition is written by a model as often as by a person, and a grammar with
// escaping in it is a grammar with a bug report in it.
//
// NOTHING HERE IS COMPULSORY. A branch's `when` and a loop.until's `until` are
// free text in the file (parse.go does not hold them to this grammar), because
// the sentence "the suite is green" is a condition a person means and no small
// language will ever hold. What this language buys is the half that CAN be
// decided without asking anybody: a condition that parses here is answered by
// this package, deterministically, and one that does not is handed to the
// environment to judge ([Env.Cond]). The split is exec.go's [Runner.cond], and
// it is one function so that a harness cannot be answered two ways.

// State is what a condition is asked about: the last step's output, and whether
// that step succeeded. It is one struct rather than two arguments because the
// runner threads it through every arm and a positional (string, bool) pair reads
// identically whichever way round it is wrong.
