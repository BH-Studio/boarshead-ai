// THIS STORE, SEEN AS ONE MORE PLACE A SUBHARNESS LIVES.
//
// A program saved here is a PAGE: the shape a design writes when somebody asks
// for one to be built for them (store.go owns the layout, and it is the only
// place that spells it). A program saved one directory over is a bundle. They
// are the same thing to everybody who is not the code that loads them — one
// catalog, one namespace, one list — and this file is what makes that true
// rather than promised: the store answers [exec.BundleSource], the registry
// takes it at [exec.LayerPages], and from there a page is a row like any other.
//
// It is the shape internal/substore's own source.go already proved, seam for
// seam, and deliberately so:
//
//	registry.UseBundles(exec.LayerPages, subharness.Default().Source(run))
//
// A STORE WITH NOTHING TO RUN PAGES IS NOT A SOURCE AT ALL, which is the
// codebase's law about a capability that cannot work stated at the earliest
// possible place: handed no runner, [Store.Source] answers a nil interface, and
// [exec.Registry.UseBundles] takes a nil source as a no-op. A build that cannot
// run one offers none.
//
// AND IT HOLDS NO CACHE. Every listing walks the directory as it stands, so a
// page saved a minute ago — by this session's own design, by another window — is
// on the next list without anybody refreshing anything. That is the same posture
// [exec.BundleSource] asks for by name, and the walk is cheap: a directory of
// names and one page read per name.

// RunPage is what actually runs a page: the name, the request in the person's own
// words, the model to think with, and a look at each step as it lands. It is the
// SAME function the conversation already runs a page with (internal/session's
// Config.RunHarness), handed here rather than reimplemented, so a run started
// from a list and a run started by a turn are one run through one path.
//
// The model may be empty, and that is what every run started from a list passes:
// empty means the model the runner was built on, which is the conversation's own.
type RunPage func(ctx context.Context, name, text, model string, step func(Trail)) (string, Usage, error)

// BriefField is the one thing a page is asked for before it runs.
//
// A PAGE TAKES ONE FREE-TEXT REQUEST AND THE OLD FORM CANNOT TAKE MORE: the
// runner threads a single string through the program (exec_model.go), so a
// manifest declaring a second field would be a card asking for something nothing
// downstream could read. One required field, named for what it is, is the whole
// of the honest front door.
const BriefField = "brief"

// briefSchema is that one field written as JSON Schema. The description is what
// the intake card draws under the field name, so it is written to somebody
// sitting in front of a blank row rather than to a reader of schemas.

// which is what [exec.BundleSource] asks for — a registry is not worth failing a

// WHAT IS NOT THERE IS LEFT EMPTY, which is the emptiness law reaching a

//
//   - CUES. A page carries none — the trigger vocabulary a design writes down
//     dies with the session that wrote it (harness_build.go says so at the line
//     that drops them) — and a manifest with no cues is found by being NAMED,
//     which is already this contract's documented posture (exec's manifest.go).
//   - THE BUDGET SHAPE. A page states no floor and no slope, so nothing here
//     invents one: a row drawing "up to 15m" for a program that never made that
//     claim would be the list speaking for it.
//   - THE OUTPUT SCHEMA. A page promises no shape. What a run PRODUCES is still
//     answered ([pageRunner.Run] fills it), but a promise nobody made is not
//     written down as though they had.
//
// The provenance is left empty too, and that is not an omission: the registry
// stamps it from the layer the program was found at, which is the one rule that
// keeps a store from claiming to be something else (exec's manifest.go).
