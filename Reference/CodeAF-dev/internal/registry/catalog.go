import "github.com/Agent-Field/codeaf/internal/store"

// seedRows is the whole catalog, seeded faithfully from what the surface can
// already do today rather than from what 5.22 says it should eventually do.
// Every row here is traceable to a real handler:
//
//   - the 17-row slash table, internal/tui/commands.go's slashCommands
//   - the bare-letter and chord keybindings routed in
//     internal/tui/model.go's updateKey and named in internal/tui/keys.go's
//     actionRunes and internal/tui/commands.go's keyBindings
//   - the head belt verbs that journal a real store command, from
//     internal/head/toolbelt.go's control/revise/expedite tools
//
// No entry names a command kind or tool the corresponding package does not
// actually define — TestJournalKindsAreRealCommandKinds and
// TestJournalToolsAreRealBeltTools check that mechanically, and
// internal/tui's own coverage test fails the build if a slash command exists
// that has no row here.
//
// Left out on purpose, findings for the ledger rather than gaps to quietly
// fill:
//
//   - CommandSplice and CommandAmend have no seeded entry. Splice is what
//     an ordinary chat message already does on every turn, not a discrete
//     verb a person invokes; amend is issued by the reconciler itself, not
//     requested through a key, a slash, or the belt. Neither has a door yet
//     for this registry to name.
//   - The belt's steer and note tools are real and journal something (a
//     redirection broadcast, a notebook fact) but neither journals a
//     store.CommandKind, so neither fits this wave's "belt verbs that map to
//     journaled commands" seeding rule. They will want a Journal shape of
//     their own in a later wave rather than a misleading empty one now.

// stay out of the unscoped palette — and they have no key and no slash alias by
// construction: the accelerator for "retire this" is having the thing open, and
// a letter that meant retire from anywhere would be a letter that eventually
// retires the wrong thing.
//
// Two shapes, and which one a row is is data rather than a rule a surface has

// [Entry.Steer] instead and seeds the composer, because the one mouth is the
// conversation and a form field is not it.
