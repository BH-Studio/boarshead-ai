// Package registry is the one command registry established by the August 2026
// chat-rebuild audit's 5.22 (no longer in the tree; "Discoverability: no
// typed-only actions"): every action lives
// on a visible object, and typing is an accelerator, never the only door. A
// single catalog of entries — id, verb phrase, description, scope predicate,
// key binding, slash alias, journal mapping — is the source every render
// surface (action strips, the summon palette, slash-filtered palette,
// contextual footer, chips, empty states) reads from, so discoverability holds
// by construction instead of by six surfaces staying in sync by hand.
//
// This package is pure data and query functions. It renders nothing and
// knows nothing about Bubble Tea, lipgloss, or any TUI type — the dependency
// runs one way, tui → registry, so a future web surface can read the same
// catalog without dragging a terminal renderer in behind it.
//
// Wave 1 seeds the catalog faithfully from what already exists — the slash
// table, the chat/task-page keybindings, and the head belt verbs that
// journal a real command — and adds no entry a live surface cannot already
// reach some other way. UI adoption (wiring the six surfaces to read from
// here instead of their own tables) is Waves 2–3.
