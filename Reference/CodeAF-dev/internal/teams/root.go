// ── THE OPTIONAL GLOBAL MANAGER IS THE MANAGER OF A REAL ROOT TEAM ──────────
//
// The ruling's goal is a person who talks to the top manager and steps away.
// With several top-level teams there is no top manager until the person makes
// one, on the teams page's `All teams` row. That manager could have been a
// special case beside the tree (a field on the file, a pseudo-team every walk
// would have to know about); it is instead the manager of an ordinary team
// marked Root that every other top-level team is moved under. The tree rules
// therefore stay ordinary: two parties in different trees meet at the root
// ([File.LCA]) and its manager decides instead of the person; a top-level
// team's manager reports to it ([File.Home]); an override on the root is what
// `· from All teams` means ([File.Effective]); and its spend is the whole
// machine's teams ([TeamSpend]). The cap resolver deliberately gives the root
// no profile-default cap, because `All teams` is the global group rather than
// one ordinary team's default pool.
//
// THE ROOT IS NOT A LEVEL. [File.Depth] does not count it, so a depth limit
// of three still means three levels of the person's own teams.
//
// tidy keeps it true: at most one root (the first), at the top, open, and
// every other top-level team under it, so a team made later at the top level
// lands under the root on the same write. [File.DissolveRoot] undoes it: the
// root team is removed and its children are top-level again; the global
// manager's conversation stays a conversation.
//
// Until the person asks, there is no root team, and the `All teams` row is a
// row the interface draws over the top level with nothing stored behind it.
//
// THE GLOBAL MANAGER'S MEMBERS ARE THE TOP-LEVEL MANAGERS (ruling c-5: orders go
// one level down, and a sub-team's manager is a member of the team above). So
// while the root has a manager, tidy makes every open top-level team's manager
// a member of the root, with the handle it has in its own team when that is
// free there. Its directives then reach them by the ordinary road, its digest
// lists them, and each reports to it by the ordinary home rule. It is only ever
// added: a membership the person removes comes back while that conversation
// still manages a top-level team, and one left behind by a manager who stopped
// being one stays until the person removes it (the session's view of the root
// shows only the current managers).

// RootName is the root team's name.
const RootName = "All teams"

// ErrRoot is a change the root cannot take: closing it (dissolve it instead)
// or putting it under another team.
