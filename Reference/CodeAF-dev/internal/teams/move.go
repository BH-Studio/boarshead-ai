// ── MOVING TEAMS: WHERE ONE MAY GO, AND WHAT A MOVE CHANGES ─────────────────
//
// The person moves a team by putting it inside another (ruling c-12, amended
// by c-13): `Move into…` on the teams page, a drag in its rail, or `Inside:` on
// the team's card. The write itself is [File.SetParent], which refuses only
// what would break the tree (a loop, the root under something). Two questions
// come before it, and both are here rather than in the interface because the
// session's own restructuring tools will ask the same ones:
//
// WHERE MAY IT GO ([File.MoveCheck]). Not into itself or anything under it,
// not into a closed team, and not so deep that the deepest team it carries
// would stand past the depth limit of the team it lands in. The answer is a
// [MoveBlock] with the facts a sentence needs (`harbor is 3 levels deep ·
// limit 3 · Settings`), and the interface draws every target, dimming the ones
// that are blocked and saying why, so nothing is hidden.
//
// WHAT WOULD CHANGE ([File.MoveEffects]). A move is only a line in a tree
// until it moves authority, money or judgement, and those are what a person
// should see before it happens: whose manager each conversation carried along
// reports to ([File.Home]), whose capped pool the moved team's spend now counts
// toward (a cap is a pool over the subtree, spend.go), and which manager
// decides a conflict among the team's own conversations ([File.LCA]). Each is
// computed on a copy of the file as the move would leave it, tidied exactly as
// the store's write would tidy it, so the answer is the one the next read will
// show. A move that changes none of them is applied at once.

// The kinds of [MoveBlock].
