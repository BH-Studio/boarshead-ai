// ── DECISION PACKETS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every decision that has to be made above the conversation that met it (a
// conflict between parties, a question a manager escalates, a judgement call,
// a cap reached, a closing report) travels as a SELF-CONTAINED PACKET (ruling
// c-7): the question, the parties and what each of them said, the options each
// with what happens if it is chosen, and a recommendation with its reason. The
// same packet is answered by a manager or by the person, so either can decide
// it without reading a transcript.
//
// WHERE IT LIVES. A packet is written in the file of the team it was raised
// from (Origin), <profile>/teams/<origin>/decisions.jsonl, and never moves:
// escalating it changes who decides (Team) and adds a hop to its trail, and
// the line that says so is appended to the same file. So a packet has one home
// and one id for its life, and a sub-team's closed view can list everything
// its members raised.
//
// THE FILE IS EVENTS, FOLDED BY ID. One JSON object per line, only ever
// appended to: a `raise` carrying the whole packet, then `decide`,
// `escalate`, or `told` lines naming it by id. Reading folds them in file order into the
// packet as it stands now. Nothing is rewritten, so a reader never sees a
// half-written packet and a writer never loses another's line.
//
// EVERY WRITE IS UNDER THE FILE'S LOCK and re-reads the fold under it, so two
// deciders cannot both decide one packet: the second is [ErrDecided]. A cap
// raise is the same shape: under that lock the writer looks for a packet
// already raised for the same pool, local day and ceiling, and a second
// raiser, including one in another process, writes nothing and is handed the
// packet that is already there. A later day, or the same day at a higher
// ceiling, is a different crossing and a new packet.
//
// READS ARE STAT-FIRST AND INCREMENTAL, for traffic.go's reason: the teams
// page asks about open packets on its clock. A file whose stamp has not moved
// is answered from memory, and one that grew is read from the byte where the
// last read stopped, never from the top. The scan across teams is one
// directory listing and a stat per team.
//
// THE FILE ROTATES LIKE TRAFFIC, and keeps every packet still waiting. Past
// [decisionsRotateBytes] the file is renamed to decisions.1.jsonl (replacing
// the one before) and the new file opens with one `carry` line per packet
// still waiting, every packet for today's cap, and the newest decided answers
// still owed to their raisers within half the rotation size. A reader folds
// the rotated file and then the current one; a carry replaces the older
// state. Oldest owed answers beyond that bound remain in the rotated file
// for one more rotation.
//
// EVERY CHANGE IS ALSO A LINE OF TRAFFIC, a [KindPacket] entry in the log of
// the team that raised it, of every team that was asked to decide it, and of
// every party's team, so the interface tailing a team's Traffic learns of a
// packet without polling this file, and a session delivering Traffic hands it
// to the manager and tells the parties.
//
// A CONFLICT'S RULING IS A DIRECTIVE TO EVERY PARTY (ruling c-6). Whoever
// decides a [PacketConflict] (the lowest common manager with [Decide], a
// manager above it after an escalation, or the person on the teams page, here
// or over --host through the engine's own [Decide]), the store appends one
// [KindDirective] to each party's team log, addressed to its handle and
// carrying the packet's id ([Entry.Packet]). So the ruling reaches every party
// by the road a directive always takes and wakes it, and it is in every
// involved team's Traffic, whoever made it. And a party never decides its
// own case: a manager who is one of the parties is not the decider even when
// the packet waits on its team ([ErrNotDecider]); the person still may.
