// call the surface makes, and one rule for which model answers it.

// An auxiliary call is any call the person did not type — the title a session
// names itself, the judge that asks whether a turn should have been work, the
// gate that reads one tool call for safety. Each is a ROLE. Roles group under TIERS, and a tier is what the
// person actually configures: "low model = X, high model = Y", set once. New
// auxiliary calls register a role, inherit their tier's model, and need no
// settings of their own; the person never learns a new knob per feature.
//
// The package is resolution and registry only. It reads settings through a
// [Source] seam and imports nothing of the surface — no session, no config —
// so the rule can be tested without a profile directory on disk and the
// wiring wave can attach whichever store it likes.

// worth thinking about — and a table of per-role seconds would be a second
// place saying the same thing, drifting the first time somebody adds a role.
//
// It is an OUTER bound, not a budget. A caller that knows its own call is

// a blank. The notation is the SURFACE'S OWN, already read by the model picker's
// ctrl+t and printed after an id on the picker row and the /status model line.

// Efforts lists the levels a tier value may carry, cheapest first.
//
// They are STRINGS HERE and not internal/provider's Effort, for the reason the
// settings keys are strings: this package imports nothing of the surface, and a
// level is a word somebody typed into a config file. The caller that puts the
// word on a request is the one that owns the adapter's type.
//
// "off" is deliberately not one of them. It is a different request — it asks a
// provider to suppress the thinking pass outright, which some endpoints refuse
// — and a tier value is a thing a person writes once and forgets, which is the
// wrong place for a knob that can fail on the wire.
