package session

// One door for every message handed to a conversation, and one answer about
// what happened to it.
//
// A task is an addressable conversation: an assignment, an owner, and a queue
// somebody drains; the main chat is the same shape with different
// responsibilities. The callers that already shared that path — a person's line
// into a room ([Agent.SteerTask]), the model's ([Agent.relayToTask]), a landed
// node's report ([Agent.deliverTaskNote]), a watch's tick — each used to pick
// its own reader, judge for itself whether it had been taken, and invent its own
// answer when nobody was there.
//
// What lives here is the delivery: who is addressed, what kind of message it is,
// who is speaking, and one hand-over that resolves the live reader and appends
// under the same lock. Scheduling, admission, assignment state and everything a
// surface draws stay where they are.
//
// Two invariants the rest of the package relies on:
//
//   - ACCEPTED IS NOT READ. A receipt says a reader that was still listening has
//     the message on its queue, and nothing more.
//   - THE ORIGIN IS NOT THE KIND. Delivery mechanics are shared; authorship is
//     not. Whether the words are journaled as the person's correction, whether
//     the folder records that the person spoke, and whether the recipient may
//     read the message as authority all follow [messageOrigin].
//
// It is local. [conversationID] carries a session because a task number is
// minted per session and repeats across them; a later cross-session router would
// resolve one to a mailbox the same way this file resolves the local ones, and
// would additionally need authenticated authority, admission policy and replay
// protection. None of that is here or implied: no discovery, no registry, no bus.
//
// AND A DELIVERY STILL CARRIES NO ASSIGNMENT REVISION: accepted means a live
// reader has the words, never that the work has been re-aimed. What closed the
// race between a correction and a worker's finalization is the NODE's own
// boundary rather than anything here (assignment.go): a line said into a room is
// recorded on the task as a direction with an origin taken from [messageOrigin],
// a landing may not publish while one is unread, and only the person's own
// direction can move what the work is judged by. This file still decides who is
// addressed and whether they took it, and nothing more.

// step boundary, which on an unattended session may never come: the wake
// declines with nobody there ([Agent.wakeLocked]), the reaper closes the session
// half an hour after the terminal detached, and the queue goes with the process.
// Marked delivered at the queue, that landing was also marked announced on the
// checkpoint, so the next life of the session did not re-tell it either.
//
// So the sender is told twice, and the two facts are different: `accepted` when
// a live reader took it ([deliveryReceipt]), and `settled` when the recipient's
// own record holds it ([Agent.recordUserLocked]). Only the second is written
