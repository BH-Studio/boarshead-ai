// THE GROUND MOVING UNDER A RUN.
//
// A task reads a file, thinks for twenty minutes, and writes over the top of a
// change that landed while it was thinking. The work is correct against a world
// that stopped being true, and nothing anywhere notices: the run finished, the
// check passed, the branch merged, and the person finds out days later.
//
// Nothing tracks what a task READ, and nothing ever will cheaply — reads are
// numerous and mostly uninteresting. So the earlier warning, the one a preflight
// could give before the money
// is spent, cannot see this case at all. LAND TIME IS WHERE IT IS CAUGHT, and
// this file is the catching: at the instant a node would merge, the paths it
// wrote are held up against the two places other work leaves marks —
//
//   - the project's index, for work that LANDED in those paths while this node
//     was running ([LandedTouching] with the node's own start as the moment), and
//   - every other window's live claims, for work that is IN those paths right
//     now ([Elsewhere.Touching]).
//
// ── WHAT IT DOES ABOUT IT ──
//
// It does not resolve anything, it does not rebase anything, and it does not
// invent a state. The node lands in the one that already exists for "finished,
// but somebody should look" — [TaskUnverified] — with its branch kept and a
// reason in the person's own words at the top of its report. From there every
// surface, every note and every bubbling path is the one an unverified landing
// already takes, which is the whole reason this reuses the state rather than
// growing a sibling for it.
//
// ── THREE LAWS ──
//
//   - A CLAIM OF OVERLAP REQUIRES ACTUAL OVERLAP. Both doors this asks answer
//     with two lists, what overlaps and what could not be asked, and only the
//     first is read here. Work that named no files is work nobody can say
//     anything about, and a flag raised on a silence would be a flag that fires
//     on every old row in the file. The cautious wording belongs to the
//     preflight, which is spending nothing when it guesses wrong; at land time a
//     false alarm teaches a person to ignore the one that is real.
//
//   - THE NODE'S OWN FAMILY IS NOT SOMEBODY ELSE. A sub-task branches off its
//     parent's worktree and merges back into it, so a child landing in a file
//     its parent also wrote is the design working, not the ground moving.
//     Descendants are dropped before the question is asked.
//
//   - NOTHING FOUND CHANGES NOTHING. No overlap and the landing is exactly the
//     landing it was: merged, done, and silent. That is the emptiness law where
//     it costs the most to break — a warning nobody needed, standing between a
//     person and work that was fine.

// groundShift is the reason this node should not settle quietly, and the empty
// string when it should. Beside it come THE FILES THE SHIFT IS IN, because the

// survives and a row cannot name what it was never handed
// (task_status.go's [taskShiftReason]).
//
// wrote is the node's own leavings — the paths it changed, repo-relative and
// slash-spelled, exactly as [changedPath] made them. A node that wrote nothing
// cannot have written over anybody, and it is answered without a single read.
//
// IT READS THE FILE AND NOT [Agent.TaskIndex]. The merged view replaces a landed
// row with one rebuilt out of the live graph, and a rebuilt row answers from
// whatever the node in memory holds — which is now the recorded landing instant
// where the record carries one, and NOTHING where it does not. Neither is what
// a window question wants: it wants the stamp that was true when the row was
// written, which is what the durable rows carry.
