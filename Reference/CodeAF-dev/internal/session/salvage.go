// A tool call the output limit cut in half is the most expensive failure this
// loop has. The model streamed thousands of tokens of arguments — all billed,
// all already in the transcript — and the old answer was to hand the tool a
// half-sent JSON string, let its parser say "unexpected end of JSON input",
// and watch the model pay the whole bill again rewriting from the top. For a
// large write that doubles the dearest call of the turn and teaches nothing:
// the error names the encoding, not the cause, so the model cannot even choose
// a smaller shape the second time.
//
// This file is the salvage yard. When the LAST call of a step arrives with
// arguments that are not valid JSON — only the last can be cut; a provider
// truncates the tail, never the middle — the loop asks two questions here.
// First: is this a clean truncation (a strict prefix of well-formed arguments)
// rather than genuine garbage? Second: is it a write whose severed content can
// land on disk exactly as the model meant it, up to the last complete line?
//
// A salvageable write gets its arguments REPAIRED — the parsed path, the
// recovered content trimmed to its final newline, the append flag if one made
// it through — and then runs through the ordinary pipeline: the approval gate
// sees the real bytes, the surface renders the real call, the transcript
// records arguments that actually parse. What changes is only the result the
// model reads back: instead of "Successfully wrote", it is told the cut
// happened, what landed, where the file now ends, and that ONE append call
// finishes the job. The retry then costs the tail, not the file.
//
// Every other tool keeps its refusal — a severed bash command or edit must
// never run on guessed arguments, and their parse-first Execute already
// guarantees nothing does — but the refusal's wording becomes the cause and
// the way out, because "Invalid arguments" was the one sentence that could
// not help.
