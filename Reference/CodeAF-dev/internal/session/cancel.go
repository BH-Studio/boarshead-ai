// STOPPING WORK, WHATEVER KIND IT IS.
//
// This session drives four kinds of thing that outlive the sentence that asked
// for them: a task node in the graph, an adaptive run, a sub-harness run, and
// a background job. Every one of them already had SOME way to end — a context,
// a goroutine, a channel, a signal — and not one of them had a way a person
// could reach. `jobs kill` is the model's tool and takes the registry's own
// numbers; this file is how a person reaches the same id as `job:3`. The fuel
// gate's "stop" only exists once a run has spent its tank. So the answer to
// "how do I stop this" was, everywhere on this surface, "say so in words and
// hope the model does it".
//
// [Agent.Cancel] is the one door. It takes an id, works out which kind of work
// that id names, and ends it — and the four endings differ only in what they
// have to cut.
//
// A HARNESS BEING DESIGNED IS NOT A FIFTH KIND. It used to be, and it is a
// task now (harness_task.go): `task:4` stops it, its own row carries the ✕, and
// the design settles saying nothing was saved.
//
// WHAT A STOP MEANS, EXACTLY. It means STOP SPENDING NOW, and every part of
// this file bends around that one sentence:
//
//	in flight    its context is cut where it stands, and its partial output is
//	             discarded — a half-answer handed on as a fact is worse than no
//	             answer at all
//	queued       dropped instantly; there is nothing running to wait for
//	settled      it keeps what it produced, and the trace stays whole
//
// WHAT IS NEVER THROWN AWAY IS THE TRACE. A stopped task keeps its branch and
// its transcript, a stopped run keeps the nodes that finished, their digests
// and its notes, a stopped job keeps its log, and they all keep what they
// spent — because a person who stops work is deciding not to spend MORE on it,
// not asking for the last twenty minutes to be deleted.
//
// IT IS IDEMPOTENT. Two presses, or a press on work that has already landed,
// is a sentence saying so and nothing else. A confirmation a surface draws and
// a key a person leans on must never be two different amounts of stopping.

// The four kinds of work an id can name, spelled as [Agent.Cancel] takes them:

// THE PREFIX IS NOT DECORATION. The counters that mint these ids are separate
// counters — the graph's, the run register's, the harness lane's, the job
// registry's — so "7" is a task AND a run AND a harness run AND a job, and a
// surface handing over a bare number would be asking this file to guess which
// piece of somebody's work to end. A bare number is read as a TASK and only as
// a task, because that is the id space every surface on this program already
