package session

// BPE working state: what is TRUE right now, and what is OPEN.
//
// The session already had experience memory — a handful of standing facts about
// the person, carried across sessions (memory.go) — and nothing else. Everything a
// turn learned about the work in front of it lived in exactly one place: the
// transcript. That is the whole problem this file exists for. A transcript is
// the one structure compaction destroys, so every compaction pass had to
// REDISCOVER the plot from the summary it had just written — which files matter,
// which subgoal is half-done, which command is the one that proves the build is
// green — and a summary is a lossy narration of a trajectory, not a record of
// state.
//
// The research (harness-research-notes.md §4, EvoHarness-RL's BPE abstraction)
// says all harness external state reduces to three roles: BELIEF (what is
// currently true in the environment), PROGRESS (subgoal statuses), EXPERIENCE
// (cross-episode priors). Experience is memory.go and is not duplicated here.
// This file is the other two, and its law is the one the same section states
// twice over:
//
//   - STATE LIVES OUTSIDE THE TRAJECTORY. These records are not messages. They
//     are held on the agent, written beside the journal, and rendered into a
//     block ([Agent.StateBlock]) that a compaction pass re-injects VERBATIM. The
//     trajectory compresses; the state does not.
//   - GROUNDED IN EXECUTION, NOT NARRATION (PMCoder). Every record cites what
//     RAN — the tool call, the command, the file that was read — and the tools
//     refuse a record with no citation. A belief the model merely asserted is a
//     belief that can be wrong forever, and worse, one that a later summary will
//     quote back as if it had been verified.
//
// The whole store is agent-managed: the model decides what to track and when to
// commit, and pays for both out of the same turn budget as its environment
// actions (the BPE paper's point — bookkeeping that is free is bookkeeping that
// is done compulsively). The tool descriptions say so in one line each.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a todo list (docs/CHAT-V3.md Decision 11 refused
// one, and still does): a todo list is a plan the person is meant to read, and
// work big enough to decompose belongs to the workforce. These records are the
// model's own working state, sized for surviving a compaction, and no surface
// draws them.

// ── the three tools ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// THESE THREE STRINGS ARE BILLED ON EVERY REQUEST OF EVERY TURN — the whole
// tool-schema block rides in front of each one, some seventy times in a single
// task — so they are written for density rather than for prose. Every rule that
// was here is still here; what left was the second and third telling of it.
//
// The budget sentence is the BPE paper's own finding rather than a style choice:
// harness actions share the interaction budget with environment actions, and an
// agent that is not told so keeps books it never reads. IT IS NOW SAID ONCE, on
// `track`, which is the only one of the three that spends anything worth
// deciding about — commit and recall carried the identical sentence and paid for
// it on every request to repeat a rule the model had already read.

// The two laws that used to sit in the preamble — what a belief is against what
// a progress item is, and that evidence must name something that RAN — now sit
// on the fields they govern. A field description is read at the moment the model
// is filling that field in, which is where a rule about the field belongs.

// AND THESE TWO ARE PLAIN CONTRACT (2026-09-10, the prompt diet). `commit` said
// "a belief no longer true goes stale and leaves", which is a figure of speech
// where a description owes a fact: a committed belief is marked stale and stops
// being rendered by `recall` ([workState.commit], and [stateStatus.closed]).
// `recall` said "so call it for an id or after one for the state you kept",
// which is a WHEN-TO-REACH rule and belongs to the page's routing table rather
// than to eighteen descriptions each keeping their own copy.
