// A CARD IS THE PAGE SOMEBODY APPROVES A RECIPE FROM, so a verb that reaches the
// harness belt without reaching subharness's words for it prints its registered
// identifier there — `edit_video`, in a column of human phrases — and a person is
// being asked to approve a bound nobody wrote a sentence about. That is what
// happened when the cutting verb joined the belt.
//
// THE TWO HALVES CAN ONLY BE COMPARED ON THIS SIDE. internal/session says what a
// whitelist may legally hold ([HarnessBeltNames], harness_belt.go) and
// internal/subharness draws it (card.go's cardToolWords); the dependency runs one
// way, so the gate lives here rather than beside the table it guards.
//
// The probe is the FOOT'S OWN LINE and not a search of the page for the name,
// because every phrase in that table contains the name it stands for — "reads
// files" for `read`. Only an exact element of `can use · a · b · c` is evidence
// that a name fell through to itself.
