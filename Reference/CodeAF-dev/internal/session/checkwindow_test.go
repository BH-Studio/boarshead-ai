//
// Correct work landed `your call` because the checker's own model call was cut
// at its thirty-second share of a one-minute window, twice, while a reasoning
// model thought without writing a word. Nothing on the wire had said how long it
// had, its calls were planned as a working node's, what it had read was thrown
// away with the stream, and the landing read as a verdict on the work. These
// pin the four halves of the fix, on the real road where the road can be driven
// and on the real adapter where the claim is about a request body.

// believedLedger scripts what the lane belief holds for one machine: its median
// output rate, known well. It is the reading the adapter sizes a told wall
// against (internal/provider's effortladder.go), so what the wire test pins is
// the budget derived from the same belief the controller waits on.
