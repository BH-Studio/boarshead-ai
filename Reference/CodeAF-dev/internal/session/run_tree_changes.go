// RunTreeSnapshot is what a working copy held before a run touched it: the
// commit it stood on and, for every path git already saw as changed, what
// that path held. A door that runs IN PLACE — `codeaf do`, which edits the
// directory it was handed and makes no commit of its own — takes one before the run and
// asks it afterwards which paths the RUN changed, so the files it names are
// the run's and never the person's own edits that were sitting there first.
//
// THE PERSON'S WORK IS NOT THE RUN'S WORK. A copy's `git status` after a run is
// the run's changes AND whatever the person had not committed yet, and the
// landing that staged the whole of it committed somebody's half-finished edit
// and an untracked secrets file as `task: <title>` on their own branch. The
// snapshot is how the two are told apart without any ledger: a path the run
// did not touch holds exactly what it held before.
//
// A directory that is not inside a git work tree has no snapshot to take, and
// [RunTreeSnapshot.Changed] answers nothing for it: there is no status to read
// the run's work off, and a walk of an arbitrary folder is not this door's
// business.
