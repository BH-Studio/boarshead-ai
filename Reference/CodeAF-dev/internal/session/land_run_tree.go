// LandRunTree commits a run's own working copy onto the branch it is checked
// out on, and it is the landing half of the run engine ([internal/run]) stated
// here, where the commit road lives.
//
// THE RUN'S WORK IS WHAT ITS TREE SAYS. Every worker of a run edits through
// bash ([NewBeltWorker]), and a shell worker fills no write ledger, so the
// working copy's status and commits since base record what the run made — the same
// road a bash-belt node's landing takes ([commitTaskWork] on its belt arm),
// reached by name rather than from inside a task tree.
//
// IT ANSWERS FOUR THINGS AND ONLY THE FIRST THREE ARE THE LANDING. The branch
// is the one the copy stands on once the commit has landed. The paths are the
// net change since base, including a branch the worker merged in; when the net
// tree is unchanged but commits moved HEAD, they are the paths those commits
// touched. The refusal is the
// sentence a person reads when the landing had
// nothing to do or the tree would not take the work, and it is empty on every
// other road. The error is non-nil when the working copy or its history cannot
// be read or landed, rather than for an ordinary refusal to bring work home.
//
// THE SWITCH IS THE BELT'S, read here for the reason [NewBeltWorker] reads it:
// the belt road stages the tree's own status minus what the harness itself
// writes, which is not what the default landing does, so a landing that ran
// with CODEAF_TASK_BELT naming the node belt would change a landing for one nobody
// composed. With the flag off this refuses and touches nothing.
//
// ATTRIBUTION IS ON UNLESS CONTRIBUTING FORBIDS IT. The same two trailer
// lines are added to worker commits and the landing commit. model is the one
// the `Assisted-by` line names; empty leaves it bare because this door does
// not know which model each worker used.
