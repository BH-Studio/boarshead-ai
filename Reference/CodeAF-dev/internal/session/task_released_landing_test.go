// A LANDING THAT ARRIVES AFTER THE SETTLE GAVE THE WORKING COPY BACK (#653).
//
// The live run these tests are written from went like this: the node settled
// needing somebody's look, the settle road committed its work and turned its
// directory back into ordinary files ([taskTree.releaseKeptLocked]), and a
// minute later the work was accepted. The accept landed the ordinary way, into
// that same directory, and git answered `fatal: not a git repository` — which
// the landing read as the person's disk refusing them and reported as "taken as
// it stands, and it could not be brought home". Nothing had gone wrong with the
// work, nothing was lost, and every word the person read was false.
//
// The node had also renamed its own task branch to the name its brief asked for,
// which is legitimate and which nothing was written to survive: the name the
// tree was carved with then named nothing at all, so the check could not cut a
// fresh copy of the work either.
//
// So each test here settles a node for real in a real repository, renames the
// branch the way the run did, and then accepts — and asserts the two things the
// run got wrong: THE LANDING DOES WHAT ITS MODE PROMISES, and the branch it
// names is the branch git will answer to.
