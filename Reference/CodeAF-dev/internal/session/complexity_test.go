// THE STANDING GATE ON HOW MANY ENDINGS ONE ROAD MAY HAVE.
//
// The four defects filed off the family audit (#229/#237, #255, #256, #258) were
// all the same miss: a function with too many endings for anybody to hold in
// their head, so one ending forgot what the others do. Nothing in a compiler
// notices that, and a review does not either — every ending reads correctly on
// its own screen, and what is wrong is only that there are nine of them.
//
// So the shape is held here, and it is held THE WAY `SIZE-BUDGET` HOLDS BYTES:
// one number that a change may not push up. A binary that grows needs the budget
// raised in the same commit as the thing that spent it, deliberately, by
// somebody who can say what it bought; a function that grows past [theCeiling]
// needs the same. The difference is only that bytes are one number for the whole
// program and this is one number per road.
//
// ── THE BARGAIN, IN FULL ──
//
//   - A NEW FUNCTION MAY NOT BE WRITTEN OVER THE CEILING. There is no road to
//     adding a row: [complexityDebt] below is the debt that existed when the
//     ratchet was fitted, and it is closed.
//   - A ROW MAY NOT GO UP. That is the ratchet, and it is the whole of what this
//     buys — the debt above cannot grow while it is being paid off.
//   - A ROW THAT IS PAID OFF IS DELETED. A function that has come down to the
//     ceiling has no debt to name, and an entry that outlived its function is a
//     lie that rots exactly as a stale exception ledger anywhere else does.
//   - AND A ROW THAT FELL IS LOWERED IN THE SAME CHANGE, which is the half that
//     makes the ratchet turn rather than merely hold. A row left at the old
//     number is slack: it would let the very next change put back everything the
//     one before it took out, with the gate green throughout. So the row IS the
//     measured number, and the failure hands the author the figure to write.
//
// ── AND IT IS A LEDGER, WHICH IS A DIFFERENT THING FROM A LOCK ──
//
// Nothing here stops somebody editing [complexityDebt]. Nothing stops somebody
// raising `SIZE-BUDGET` either, or adding a line to `.github/known-red.txt`, and
// the answer is the same for all three: the edit is a LINE IN THE DIFF that a
// reviewer reads and the author has to justify in words. What the gate buys is
// that the growth cannot happen QUIETLY — which is exactly how it happened, one
// ending at a time, over the runs that produced #229, #255, #256 and #258.
//
// The count is gocyclo's, because it is the number everybody quotes: one, plus
// every `if`, `for`, `range`, named `case`, named comm clause, `&&` and `||` —
// a `default` decides nothing and gocyclo does not count one. It is computed
// here over `go/ast` rather than shelled out to the tool, so the gate is `go
// test` and the repository gains no dependency to run it: anybody who wants a
// second opinion can run gocyclo over the same files and read the same numbers.

// theCeiling is how many decisions one function may hold. Fifteen is the number
// the repository's own quality bar already states (CLAUDE.md: no function over
// about fifteen branches), written down here so the bar and the gate cannot
// drift apart.
const theCeiling = 15

// complexityDebt is every function in `task*.go` that was already over
// [theCeiling] when this gate was fitted, the number it measured at, and one
// line saying what the debt IS — because a number with no account of itself is
// a number nobody can pay off.
//
// Measured on 2026-09-01, on top of #277, after #260's extractions.
// `runTaskChild` was the worst of them at 56 and is not here: it is [childRun]
// now (task_child_run.go), and every one of its phases is under the ceiling.
//
// THE NUMBERS ARE THE ONES MEASURED WHERE THE GATE WAS FITTED. A ledger cannot
// refuse the debt it was built to hold; it can only refuse the next one.
