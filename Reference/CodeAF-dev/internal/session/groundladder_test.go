// is, on every rung of the ladder.

// Every test here is written from the same counterfactual, because it is the one
// that cost real money: a parent holds work nobody has committed, hands out a
// child, and the child wakes up in a world that does not contain it. Before
// groundladder.go that was the guaranteed outcome of every division — the branch
// carried HEAD and said so — and four workers spent an hour proving it.

// installFakeFurrow puts a furrow-shaped script where internal/furrow looks
// first, so that one test can drive the top rung on any machine.
//
// IT REALLY COPIES THE FOLDER. A fake that only printed furrow's JSON would let
// this file assert that a fork was asked for and never that a world came back,
// which is the only claim worth making about the rung.
//
// AND IT REALLY ATTACHES. The real program answers `status` only for a folder it
// has been pointed at, and writes a `.furrow/` directory into that folder when
// it is — which is the whole reason [hideFurrowMarker] exists, so a fake that
// skipped it would leave the one thing nobody could test.
//
// AND IT REALLY KEEPS THE FORK RECORDS, one file per universe under the marker
// directory, which `forks` lists and `fork-rm` removes. A fake that printed a
// drop without forgetting anything would let issue #195's test assert that a
// drop was ASKED FOR and never that the record went, and the record going is the
// entire claim.
