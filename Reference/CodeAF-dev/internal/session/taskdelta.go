package session

// WHAT CHANGED OUTSIDE THIS CONVERSATION, PUT IN FRONT OF THE MODEL.
//
// Every other file in this coordination family answers a person: the home page
// draws the world (world.go), the task page draws another window's rows
// (taskelsewhere.go), the roster draws this session's own. THIS ONE ANSWERS THE
// MODEL, and it is the first thing in the package that does — until it landed,
// the other windows on a project were visible on the screen and completely
// invisible to the thing doing the work.
//
// The cost of that was paid twice a day and never named: a model that edits a
// file another window landed in an hour ago is editing a view of the world that
// stopped being true, and a model that greps its way to a fact a sibling task
// established this morning pays full price for a discovery somebody already
// bought. Neither is a mistake the model could have avoided. It was not told.
//
// ── TWO HALVES, TWO TENSES ──
//
//   - THE PAST: work that LANDED in this project, in other windows, since this
//     session's model was last told. Label, what came of it, and which files it
//     wrote — the citations [TaskIndexEntry.Files] carries.
//   - THE PRESENT: what the other windows have out RIGHT NOW, with the files
//     those runs have already written ([PresenceTask.Files]). This is the half
//     that says whose ground is moving before the model edits it.
//
// ── FACTS, NEVER INSTRUCTIONS ──
//
// The block states what other windows did and are doing, and asks the model for
// nothing. THIS IS A LAW AND NOT A STYLE. A title in it was written by another
// window's model; the moment this block could tell this session what to do,
// every window on the machine would be a way to steer every other one. So the
// block has no verbs aimed at the reader, no "check this", no "avoid that" —
// the model renders it to its person or plans around it, exactly as the design
// doc's noticeboard rule requires.
//
// ── AND IT GOES QUIET ──
//
// A block that said "nothing new" every turn would be a tax on every request
// for the rest of the conversation, which is the emptiness law applied to
// context: nothing to say is NOTHING WRITTEN. And a block whose facts have not
// moved is not rebuilt — the bytes in message[0] stay identical, so the prompt
// prefix stays cached and an unchanged fact costs nothing to keep saying.
//
// That is also why NO CLOCK APPEARS IN IT. "running for 4m 12s" is a fact that
// changes every single turn, and one age in this block would make it churn
// forever and be re-sent forever. The past half's tense is "recently" and the
// present half's is "now"; neither needs a number.

	// months old, none of them news. Nothing is a real hole: the commonest
	// reason a person opens a second window is that the first one is running
	// something, and a delta that said nothing about it on its first turn would
	// miss the one case it exists for. So the first delivery is BOUNDED rather
	// than empty — a day of landings, capped at [deltaLandedRows] like every

	//
	// THE CHECK AND THE WRITES ARE ONE HOLD BECAUSE THE CHECK IS TRUE ONLY FOR
	// AS LONG AS IT IS HELD — `Close` sets `closed` under this same lock. The
	// shape is deliberate and temporary: #999 lands [Agent.writeIfOpen], the one
	// door for exactly this — write nothing into a conversation that has closed,
	// already carried by the memory pass and the phase news — and this region
	// becomes a call to it with the three lines below as its closure. Nothing but
	// those three lines belongs between the check and the unlock until it does.
	//
	// AND THE TURN ENDING IS NOT THAT DOOR. The context is what stops this
	// reading STARTING work — the walk above — and it deliberately does not stop
	// the answer landing: `elsewhereText` is not this turn's, it is the
	// conversation's, and the note the next request opens with reads it
	// ([Agent.landVolatileLocked]). That is the bargain loop.go states in so many
	// words, "a read that lands after the first request rides the next step", and
	// it is the difference between a slow disk costing one turn and a slow disk
	// costing every turn: dropped here, the next reading starts from the same
	// unmoved `since` and re-walks the same index, forever, delivering nothing on
	// a machine where the walk outlasts a short turn.
	//
	// AND THE STAMP IS OWED WITH THE ASSIGNMENT RATHER THAN AHEAD OF THE READS.
	// It says THIS SESSION'S MODEL WAS TOLD, and the assignment is the last
	// moment at which that can still be arranged: after it the block is in
	// `elsewhereText` and the next request carries it. That is not the same as
	// the model having READ it, and this stamp cannot honestly claim more than it
	// — `elsewhereTold` lives in memory alone, so a process that stops between
	// here and the next request loses those rows from the block while the stamp
	// says they were told. What the old order — stamping before the reads —
	// bought over this was nothing at all, and what it cost was that same loss
	// over the whole of the walk, plus every session that closed during one.
	//
	// The assignment itself puts the block at the tail of the transcript, in the
	// note the drain lands immediately before the next request, and not in
	// message[0] where it used to sit: writing it there re-priced every message
	// of the conversation behind it each time another window landed something.

// A [stampWriter] coalesces by REPLACING its patch, so two owes collapse into
// the later CLOSURE — which is the same thing as the later instant only while
// the owes are ordered, and there is one window in this session where they are
// not. [Agent.Abandon] releases `a.mu` before it cancels, so an older reading
// can be inside this function while a newer one, started by the turn that
// replaced it, is already through: the older closure would then be the survivor
// and would write a stamp BEHIND the block the model has actually been handed,
// which re-reads landings it was told about and [deltaRemember] then
// de-duplicates into news nobody is ever told.
//
// So the instant is kept beside the writer under `a.mu` and only ever moves
// forward, and the patch writes what is kept rather than what it closed over.
// [NoteTold]'s own forward-only guard is the same law one layer down, against
// the other process on the same folder; this one is about this session's own two
