// TestAGitCommandWithNoDirectoryNeverRuns is the deterministic half of the
// checkout guard in hermetic_checkout_test.go, which can only witness a run
// that already went wrong and only inside a checkout.
//
// exec.Cmd reads an empty Dir as the calling process's own working directory,
// so a caller whose ground was never made used to commit into whatever
// repository the process happened to be sitting in: one run of this package
// wrote "task: Rewrite", "task: Measure" and "task: Paint" onto the branch of
// the worktree it was launched from. Every call site names a directory, so one
// that answers "" is a defect, and it fails here rather than somewhere else.
// TestStatusReadsWithNoDirectoryNeverRuns is the same proof for the two call
// sites that built `git -C <dir>` themselves instead of asking [gitWith]:
// [worktreeDirtIn]'s dirty fingerprint and [UnsavedEditsNote]'s status reading.
// `git -C ""` is a no-op — git runs where the process is standing — so a direct
// exec.Command with an empty directory slipped past the refusal in gitWith.
// The repository the process stands in holds a TRACKED file with an unsaved
// edit, because [UnsavedEditsNote] reads with --untracked-files=no and an
// untracked file alone would leave it silent whether or not git ran.
