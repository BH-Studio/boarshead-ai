// THE BELT SEAM FOR THE STANDING TREE.
//
// standingtree.go decides WHERE a path aimed at a referred folder really goes.
// This file is the one place that decision touches a tool: three hands — read,
// write and edit — pass their `path` argument through it on the way in, and the
// write hands say one sentence about it on the way out.
//
// ── WHY THE WRAPPER IS OUTERMOST ──
//
// It rewrites `path` to the ABSOLUTE path inside the working copy and hands the
// call on. Everything downstream then works unchanged and unknowing: bare's own
// tools resolve an absolute path to itself, the appendable write reads the file
// it is about to add to from the copy rather than from the folder
// (tools_write.go), and the PDF sense opens the copy's bytes. A wrapper on the
// inside would have left each of those reading one file and writing another.
//
// ── AND WHY THE MODEL IS TOLD ──
//
// A write that quietly lands somewhere else is a write the model will reason
// about wrongly for the rest of the turn. So the FIRST write into each folder's
// copy carries one sentence in its result: where the work is, that the folder
// itself has not moved, and that the paths it has been using still work. It is
// said once per copy per process rather than on every call — a model that has
// been told does not need telling again, and a resumed conversation gets told
// again because its model has not been told at all.
