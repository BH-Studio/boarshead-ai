// CARRYING ON A RUN NOTHING IS DRIVING.
//
// A run whose process went away is [TaskInterrupted]: nothing is driving it and
// every step it took is in its store. This is the door that picks one back up.
//
// IT MAKES NOTHING. It adopts the copy the run was written down as working in
// ([runCopyTree]) and the store that is already on disk, and it hands both to
// the supervisor the run was using before. The supervisor releases claims whose
// owner is gone and re-reads the ready set on its own next pass, so there is no
// resume machinery here and no second scheduler: carrying on is the ordinary
// pass, run by a process that was not there for the last one.
//
// Startup uses this same door to reconnect an already accepted ordinary task.
// It never creates a fresh working copy or adopts a different plan, and a
// settled or explicitly stopped run is never carried on.

// ContinueRun picks up a run that nothing is driving, by the number its row
// wears — the same number every other surface and the stop road already know it
// by (stoprun.go).
//
// IT REFUSES RATHER THAN REPAIRS, every time, and each refusal names the thing
// that is in the way in the person's own words:
//
//   - a run already going, because a conversation drives one at a time and the
//     honest answer to "carry this on" is that it never stopped;
//   - a row that is not a run, or no such row at all;
//   - a run that settled, which has nothing left to carry on;
//   - a run whose working copy was never written down or is gone from disk
//     ([runCopyTree] holds both sentences).
//
// THE ANSWER IS THE PERSON'S OWN SENTENCE and the error is for the caller. A
// door that spends money says what it did in the words the person will read
// about it afterwards.
