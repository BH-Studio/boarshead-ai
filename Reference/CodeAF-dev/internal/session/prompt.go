// THE SURFACE THAT PICKS THE APPROACH CARRIES THE DISCIPLINE FOR PICKING IT.
// Measured over twelve unattended runs of the same brief, the approach — and
// with it the whole outcome — was settled in the first couple of minutes of the
// CONVERSATION, before any task existed: the runs whose chat spent one step
// asking whether the thing already existed reached a real result three times out
// of three, and the runs whose chat set about making it by hand reached one none
// of five times in four hours. These three principles were on the worker's page
// alone, so the surface that was actually deciding never read them.
//
// It is SUBSTITUTED and not appended, at the point in each page where that page
// teaches working discipline, and it is substituted ONCE: prompts/system.md is
// read by every surface this package renders — the conversation and every worker,
// the floor of the tree included — so a second copy in prompts/worker.md would
// be a paragraph every worker paid for twice and the law stated in two places that

//
// IT IS NOT YET WHAT THE MODEL READS. It still carries [beltFactsToken], and
// what stands in for that is the one part of the page that DOES depend on the
// config: the session facts that name a tool, composed for this agent's belt
// (beltfacts.go). [promptWithBeltFacts] is the finished page, and it is what

// deliverables, grounding and background work; what it needs extra is the part

//
// IT IS THE ROLE AND NOT THE ABILITIES, which is why it was split. Every
// worker is one of these — the floor of the tree included — and the pages below
// are the verbs only some of them carry. A worker that was told nothing about

//
// It is its own page on [revisePrompt]'s law rather than a paragraph inside
// prompts/worker.md: it names `items`, which is absent from every belt but a
// quick worker's, and a page teaching a verb that is not on the belt is the
// prompt lying.
//
// AND IT OPENS BY SAYING THE PAGE ABOVE IT IS NOT ABOUT IT, which is
// [handToolTail]'s shape and is here for [handToolTail]'s reason. A quick worker still
// reads [workerPrompt] — it is a task, it owns its outcome, directions still
// reach it, and there is nobody to ask — but three of that page's sentences are
// plainly false of it: the acceptance it was handed, the task folder, and the

// leave the model holding two accounts of where it is working, and it would act
// on whichever it read last.
//
// AND IT IS THE ONLY PLACE THESE LAWS ARE WRITTEN. The node's opening message
// carries the job and the record it came out of and no rules at all

// (prompts/system.md) describes a pane, slash commands and ten tools this belt
// does not carry, and prompts/worker.md is the TASK worker's page — the report it

// picked is written cold whatever the page says, so re-rendering it on the
// switch buys the right name for nothing. Two things keep it that way:
//
//   - THE CLOCK IS NOT MOVED. The page is rendered at [Agent.systemAt], the
//     moment it was last rendered, so the only bytes that change are the ones
//     that follow the model. Switching back to the model before is then the
//     page that model already has cached, byte for byte, rather than a second
//     cold write for a newer minute.
//   - A PAGE THAT DOES NOT NAME THE MODEL IS LEFT ALONE. With the model's name off
//     the render comes back identical and message[0] is not touched at all.
//
// A prompt this agent did not write is never re-rendered ([Agent.systemOwn]).

// turn of a long conversation where there is nobody else's latency to hide
// behind. The files it re-reads have not changed since the session opened in the
// overwhelming majority of cases, and a project with several folders attached
// pays the same read once per folder (placescontext.go).
