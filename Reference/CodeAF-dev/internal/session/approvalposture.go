// ── THE CONVERSATION'S OWN POSTURE ON THE TOOL GATE ─────────────────────────
//
// The gate had two scopes and neither was the one a person standing in a
// conversation reaches for. The settings rows (`tools.approvalMode`, its two
// exception rows and the guardian) are the INSTALL'S answer, persisted, and a
// change there lands wherever the rows are next read. `--yolo` is the LAUNCH'S
// answer: it opens the gate for the whole process and writes nothing down. What
// was missing is the scope the thinking rung already has (effort.go) — THIS
// CONVERSATION, moved from inside it, kept in its own meta.json so that a
// person who opened the gate here, closed the terminal and came back finds it
// where they left it.
//
// THE POSTURES ARE A LADDER OF INCREASING AUTONOMY AND NOT THE ROW'S ENUM. The
// row says prompt, allow or deny; a wheel that walked those three would put
// "refuse every call" one press past "run every call", which is a wheel that
// breaks a session by accident. So the ladder the surface walks is
//
//	ask       every call the rules say to ask about is asked about
//	guardian  a small model answers the plainly-safe ones, you get the rest
//	allow     the gate is open — the same posture --yolo opens
//
// with `deny` reachable by NAME and never by a press, and `auto` the way back
// to whatever the settings rows say. A posture is a WORD FOR A PAIR — the
// blanket mode and whether the guardian stands in — and the guardian's row is
// folded into the ladder because the settings panel already positions it as a
// filter in front of the mode rather than as a fourth mode.
//
// THE ENGINE HOLDS THE WORD AND SOMEBODY ELSE BUILDS THE GATE. A policy is built
// from three settings rows resolved through the project layer, which is
// cmd/codeaf's knowledge and not this package's (approvalgate.go says why the
// gate is pushed rather than re-read). So the door onto the rows is handed in
// as [Config.ApprovalGate], and [Agent.SetApprovalPosture] asks it for the
// finished policy the way a consent card's banked rule already does — the same
// v3Policy, the same rows, the same floors. A session with no such door has no
// dial: the surface asks [Agent.ApprovalDial] and draws no control, which is
// the design law that a capability which cannot work is absent rather than
// broken.

// The postures, spelled once. They are the words `/approvals` takes and the
// words meta.json keeps; what a PERSON reads for each is the surface's
// (internal/tui3's approvalchip.go).

	// person chooses on purpose and it is never a stop on the wheel.
