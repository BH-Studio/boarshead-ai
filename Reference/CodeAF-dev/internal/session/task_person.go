// taskJudgePrompt sizes one piece of work. WHAT IT DECIDES IS NARROWER THAN IT
// LOOKS: the answer never settles whether the work starts, or how. The work has
// already started as one worker by the time this is asked — the judge reads the
// person's sentence BESIDE that worker (task_divide_sketch.go's
// [Agent.proposalBeside]) — and its yes is a division proposed for the worker,
// put through the same gates and the same reviewer any division is. A no costs
// nothing, because one worker is what is already running, which is what frees
// the judge to be strict ("when unsure, false").
const taskJudgePrompt = `Decide whether this task is meaningfully parallelizable or nestable for speed or quality. Parallel means independent parts can proceed at the same time and a planner can combine them; a merely long sequence is not parallel.

Answer with exactly one JSON object and no markdown:
{"parallelizable":bool,"parts":["part in at most 6 words"],"why":"reason in at most 12 words"}

Use at most 6 parts. When unsure, set parallelizable to false.

You are only deciding whether to plan the work up front. Work that starts as one worker can still split itself later, once the worker has opened the material and can see how much of it there is, so a "false" here does not commit the work to one pair of hands. Say true only when the parts are already visible from the request itself.`

// WHAT WAS TRUE: the surface asked the sizing judge (three seconds) and then this
// door asked the shaper (twenty-five) before the node was admitted, in series,
// and on a thinking model both ran their windows out and returned nothing — so
// every `/task` read `shaping the brief…` for twenty-eight seconds and then
// started on the person's sentence anyway (issue #936).
//
// WHAT IS TRUE NOW: the node is admitted here, at once, on the person's own
// sentence and the canned done-condition, and both readings run BESIDE ITS FIRST
// WORKER through the one mechanism every answer beside the work comes through
// (task_beside.go). The shaper writes the brief and hands it to the worker when
// it lands (task_shape.go); the judge reads the sentence for width and its parts
// are weighed as a division the worker is handed (task_divide_sketch.go). Neither
// decides whether the work may start, and the worker's first request waits on
// neither.
//
// solo is the person saying the work is one worker's and asking for no reading
// of its width — `/task solo`, or a standing answer of `single` — and it is the
// only thing the judge needs to be told not to do.
//
// THE NAME is the one the namer gives every node nothing named
// ([TaskGraph.nameNode]), asked the moment the node exists; until it lands, the
// title is the mechanical cut of the person's opening words ([taskPersonTitle]).
//
// WHAT IS STILL THEIRS, WORD FOR WORD, is the summary under the row and the
// request the worker is told outranks anything a model wrote.

	// this one path did not do. A person's task named no model, so the field was
	// left empty and the id was picked much later, when the worker was actually
	// spun up (task_run.go's [Agent.newTaskAgent] falling to a.model). Two things
	// were wrong with that. A `/model` switch between starting the task and the
	// worker reaching the front of the queue moved the work onto a model nobody
	// chose it for; and an empty field is an empty [TaskNotice.Model], so the
	// node's own room had nothing to say about what was running it.
	//
	// FROZEN AGAINST DRIFT IS NOT FROZEN AGAINST THE PERSON. What the freeze
	// stops is the IMPLICIT move — the conversation's dial reaching across into
	// work that was handed over before it turned. A person standing in this
	// node's room and picking a model for THIS node moves it, from its next turn
	// on, and moves nothing else ([Agent.RetargetTask], task_room.go). That door
	// is the only writer of this field after this line, and a node that has
	// settled is refused at it.
	//
	// The word is empty because a person's task names no model, and
	// [Agent.resolveTaskModel] answers that with the configured task model or the
	// conversation's own — the same ladder a proposal's blank `model` argument
	// takes, so both doors freeze the same id at the same moment.

// worker that starts, opens the material and then hands out what it can actually
// see is the shape the measured runs favour (internal/splitgate, task_divide.go).

// today by cmd/harness-design's own driver — no conversation reaches it at all
// since the anchored cue went the same way this command's word did (loop.go).
