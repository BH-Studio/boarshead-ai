package session

// speak is the session's voice: text in, an audio file on disk, a path back.
//
// It is generate_image's twin in every way that matters (tools_image.go), and
// deliberately so — one landing law, one artifact row, one auxiliary pocket, one
// absence law — because a person who has learned where their pictures go has
// learned where their audio goes. What differs is only the endpoint and the
// extension: /audio/speech, mp3.
//
// THE BYTES NEVER ENTER THE TRANSCRIPT, for image.go's reason and more so: a
// minute of speech is a megabyte, base64 inflates it by a third, and a
// transcript carrying it re-sends it on every step of every turn afterwards. The
// result is one line naming the file, and the file is what the person plays.
