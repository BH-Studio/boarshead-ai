// THE DELEGATE DOOR: how a conversation hands a task to a program codeaf
// carries — senior-dev first (internal/delegate, docs/design/delegate/). A
// program is one more worker kind behind the run engine, and this file is the
// half a conversation needs of it: which programs this build carries, the door
// `/<name> <brief>` and `propose_task`'s `via` both open, and the landing of a
// run whose worker was a program rather than a bash worker.
//
// "DELEGATE" IS A WORKING TITLE. Every sentence here a person or the model can
// read names the program itself, so a later rename of the idea changes code
// and never a promise already made on a screen.
//
// IT RIDES THE RUN ROAD WHATEVER THE BELT SAYS. `/task` takes the run road only
// under CODEAF_TASK_BELT=bash, because that road's WORKER is the bash belt. A
// program's worker is the program, so the road is asked for outright here: the
// store, the supervisor and the row are the run's, and nothing in them reads
// the belt switch. What a delegated run does not have is a copy — a program
// that edits files works in the folder itself, on a branch of its own in a
// repository (programfolder.go) — or the review round, because a check seat is
// a bash-belt worker and the belt may be off; the program's own verification is
// what its terminal record reports.

// are the program's own [delegate.Delegate.Guide], printed under its name, so
// nothing here names senior-dev. What is true of every program that edits
// files — that it works in the folder itself, and so which folder it must be
// handed — is codeaf's mechanics, and is said here once ([delegateFolderRule]).
// That nobody can be asked anything is `propose_task`'s own `brief`
// description, and that small work is never handed off is this section's
// own; neither is said a second time here.
//
// AND CODEAF PREFERS A PROGRAM FOR THE WORK IT IS FOR. The paragraph said a
// large task "can" go to one, which is a permission, and a permission loses
// to the two roads the rest of the section teaches: an issue in a mature
// project is worked through inline, or handed to codeaf's own worker, which
// has none of a program's machinery for that work. The owner's call of
// 2026-09-24 is that codeaf reach for a program by itself on complicated,
// many-sided coding work, and almost always when the person asks for one. So
// the first sentence is a preference over both of those roads, the program's
// guide under it says which work that is, and WHATEVER ITS CRITICAL PATH is
// said because the section's own test for a hand-off is the critical path:
// one hard fix has a single one, and a model holding that test alone would
// keep the fix. The second sentence is the person's ask, which outranks the
// section's floor on small work; code holds both halves of it, where a prompt
// would be forgotten (delegate_asked.go).
//
