// WHAT THE CHECKER MAY RUN, AND WHO GETS TO SAY.
//
// ── THE LAW ──
//
// THE CHECKER RE-RUNS THE VERIFICATION THE WORK DECLARED, AND NEVER THE WORK
// ITSELF. There are exactly two sources for the commands one audit may run, and
// neither is a language, a toolchain, a build system this file has heard of, or
// a span of prose somebody wrote in backticks:
//
//	(a) THE DECLARED VERIFICATION CONTRACT — the commands the proposal typed into
//	    its own `checks` field, carried on the node from admission and kept only
//	    if the checker could really run them where it is standing
//	    ([TaskNode.verification], [runnableHere]). A division's parts declare
//	    theirs the same way, and a DECLARED check that turned out to belong to the
//	    whole family rather than to any one part arrives on the parent by the same
//	    road ([TaskNode.FamilyDeclared]) — a repeat this package merely RECOGNISED
//	    in two parts' prose is lifted off them as work and never as a door.
//	(b) THE ALWAYS-SAFE READING COMMANDS — the ones that print and cannot change
//	    the thing under judgement ([auditReadCommands]). They are not verification
//	    and they are here anyway, for the reason stated on the list itself.
//
// Everything else is refused, and the refusal NAMES what this audit may run, so
// a model that reached for the wrong door reads the right one in the same
// breath (task_audit.go's [refuseOutsideDoor]).
//
// AN UNDECLARED CHECK IS NO CHECK, AND THAT IS THE ANSWER RATHER THAN A GAP. A
// node whose proposal declared nothing — every node admitted before this field
// existed, and every checkpoint written before it — gets the reading commands
// alone, is TOLD so, and judges the work from what it can see and from the
// worker's own receipts, which are in front of it either way ([auditReceiptBlock]
// in task_audit.go). What it must not do is guess a command out of the document
// and run it, for the reason the double-run section below is made of.
//
// A CHECK IS A FILE OR IT IS A COMMAND, and the two are not matched the same
// way. A declared check that names a file the tree really holds is admitted
// UNDER THE SPELLINGS THAT REALLY START THAT FILE — the file on its own, the file
// with a directory in front of it, the file behind THE INTERPRETER THE FILE
// ITSELF NAMES — because which of those a model reaches for is a coin toss the
// work never had an opinion about. Which word may stand in front is read OFF THE
// FILE (its shebang line, its executable bit) and never off a list of launchers
// this package keeps, which is why `rm <the check>` is not a spelling of the
// check. A check that names no file keeps the field-by-field prefix match it
// always had.
//
// ── THE MEASURED FAILURE THAT PUT IT HERE ──
//
// The allowlist used to be a constant: `go test`, `go build`, `go vet`, and
// git's read-only reporting. On a live SWE-Marathon run — a Rust deliverable, in
// a container with no git on the PATH — every one of those was either wrong or
// absent. The auditor reached for the project's own check, the one the task
// itself names, and was told:
//
//	refused: bash run_tests.sh is not verification, and an auditor only runs
//	verification. You may run: go test, go build, go vet, git diff, git log,
//	git status, git show, pwd, wc, head, cat
//
// It could not run the build either. So it read source files until its five
// minutes ran out — 21 calls, 300 seconds, six cents — and the node landed on the
// window running out, which lands as the person's call, which is a run stalled
// waiting for a person. (The sentence that says so is [checkerRanOut]
// now, and it says only what a clock knows.) That happened on
// EVERY ONE of the six audits of that run's main task. A gate that can only
// verify one language is not a gate, it is a coincidence.
//
// ── WHY THE SAFETY ARGUMENT DOES NOT MOVE ──
//
// The auditor still has no hand that writes, and its bash still runs ONE command
// with no shell composition. What changed is where the list of commands comes
// from, not what a command may be — and a command a blanket-allow policy would
// still stop and ask about (internal/approval's critical table) never becomes a
// door however the work spelled it.
//
// ── THE SECOND MEASURED FAILURE: ONE FILE, FIVE SPELLINGS, FIVE REFUSALS ──
//
// The door above was live on the next run of the same benchmark, and it opened
// onto nothing anyway. It offered:
//
//	You may run: /workspace/rust-java-lsp/target/release/rust-java-lsp,
//	run_tests.*, /workspace/golden.jsonl, bash /app/timer.sh, git diff, ...
//
// and the auditor, reading that, tried in order: the check with the directory it
// was standing in stated first — refused, composition; the check with its
// absolute path — refused, not on the list; the bare name — no such program on
// the PATH; the name with a program word in front — refused; the name with a dot
// and a slash in front — refused. FIVE SPELLINGS OF ONE FILE, and the file was
// sitting in the tree the whole time. That is [auditDoor.admitsFile]: the door
// asks WHICH FILE a command names, not how the model typed it — and then asks the
// file itself which word is entitled to start it ([fileFacts]).
//
// ── THE THIRD MEASURED FAILURE: A DOOR ONTO A WORD THAT IS NOT A PROGRAM ──
//
// The declaring source used to admit EVERY backticked span in the document that
// had the shape of a command, on the reasoning that a dead entry costs a line of
// a refusal and a missing check costs a verdict. A real acceptance then
// backticked the things prose backticks — a remote, a branch, a repository, a
// rule identifier — and the door read:
//
//	You may run: origin, main, Agent-Field/agentfield, js/polynomial-redos, …
//
// The checker did exactly what it was told it could do. It ran them, one after
// another, collected the shell's 127s and 126s, and wrote "Ran the named checks:
// all refused or exit 126/127" into a finding A PERSON THEN READ as the state of
// the work. A dead entry does not cost a line of a refusal; it costs the finding
// the whole audit exists to produce, because a model handed a door believes the
// door.
//
// SO A DECLARED CHECK IS A DOOR ONLY IF IT COULD RUN WHERE THE CHECKER STANDS —
// its first word is a program the shell would find, or it names a file really
// sitting in the ground the auditor was put in ([runnableHere]). Both halves are
// questions asked of the machine the check would run on rather than of a list
// this package keeps, which is the same law the rest of this file is made of.
//
// ── THE FOURTH MEASURED FAILURE: THE WORK DONE TWICE ──
//
// The door used to hold a second source: EVERY COMMAND THE LAST WORKER RAN, read
// off its own tool receipts, on the reasoning that a worker hammering a build has
// said what the check is more clearly than any document. A live run then asked
// one task to run `./slow-build.sh` — two minutes of real work — and report the
// marker it wrote. The worker ran it once, exit 0, and read the marker back. The
// checker was handed that receipt as a door, ran the same script AGAIN for
// another two minutes, and answered a question nobody had asked.
//
// WHAT A WORKER RAN IS EVIDENCE OF WHAT HAPPENED, NOT PERMISSION TO MAKE IT
// HAPPEN AGAIN, and the difference is not about danger: the script was approved,
// it was uncomposed, it changed nothing a critical policy would have stopped. It
// is about WHAT THE REQUESTED ACTION WAS. A build, a deploy, a message sent, a
// counter incremented — the request was that it happen ONCE, and a second run is
// a second effect the person is paying for and did not ask for, in a copy of the
// tree where its result may not even mean the same thing.
//
// So a receipt is not a door any more. It is still in front of the checker, whole
// and verbatim, in the packet ([auditReceiptBlock]) — which is where it belongs,
// because a checker reading "the script ran, exit 0, here is the marker" can
// settle that the requested action completed WITHOUT MAKING IT HAPPEN TWICE. A
// command is re-run only where somebody declared, in the contract, that re-running
// it is how this work is verified.

//
// A NIL NODE STILL GETS THE READING COMMANDS. Every caller here has a node, but
// a door with no allowlist at all would be a bash that refuses everything, and a
// belt whose hand refuses everything is a hand this build would not have put on
// (CLAUDE.md's absent-not-broken law).
//
// THE GROUND IS THE DIRECTORY THE AUDITOR WILL BE PUT IN and not some other one:
// a file check resolved against a directory the auditor is not standing in would
// admit spellings that name nothing where it is typing them.
//
// A DECLARED CHECK IS ASKED THE SAME TWO QUESTIONS A DOOR HAS ALWAYS ASKED — is
// it one command in shape ([commandLike]), and could it run where the checker
// stands ([runnableHere]) — because a contract is written before the work and a
// command that names nothing under the auditor's feet is a refusal it will spend
// a step on rather than a check it can make.
//
// AND A DECLARED CHECK IS RUN AGAINST THE TASK'S OWN COPY, which is what `own`
// is for (#886). The contract is written in the folder the work is ABOUT, by a
// parent standing in it; the checker stands in a copy, and an absolute argument
// is not a cwd question — so every address at or under the ground is bound to
// the copy the command will be run in ([taskCopy.bindCommand]) BEFORE the
// question below is asked of it. That order is the other half of the fix: a
// check naming the ground's own `run_tests.sh` by its absolute path was not
// runnable where the checker stood, and was dropped from the door in silence.
//
// AND STALE CHECKS ARE WORSE THAN NO CHECKS. A command declared against one goal,
// run against the next one and passed, is a verdict nobody earned — so a node
// whose verification was written for an earlier revision of its assignment gets
// the reading commands and the sentence that says it has nothing to re-run,
// exactly as a node that declared nothing does. The verification and the revision
// it is judged against come out of ONE snapshot ([TaskNode.verification]), taken
// in one hold of the graph's lock, because two readings could not be compared
// honestly: a revision landing between them would show the old goal's commands

// `/abs/path/run_tests.sh`, all of which start it. Two words are a program and
// the file it is handed. Three words are not a spelling of the check at all —
// they are the check plus arguments the work never declared, and this door speaks
// only for what the work declared.
//
// THE SECOND QUESTION IS ASKED OF THE FILE ITSELF, and it is why `rm <the check>`
// is refused while `<its interpreter> <the check>` is not. Three answers open a
// spelling, and all three are facts rather than a list this package keeps:
//
//   - THE WORK'S OWN SPELLING, exactly as the work wrote or ran it. The one
//     citizen entitled to say how a check is run is the work that declared it, and
//     a receipt is the work saying it a second time, in the shell.
//   - THE FILE ON ITS OWN, when the file is executable or carries a line saying
//     what starts it. Both are the file stating that running it is a thing that
//     happens; a file that states neither is data until the work says otherwise.
//   - THE INTERPRETER THE FILE NAMES, in front of it. A script's first line names
//     the program that runs it ([fileFacts]), so the file — not this package —
//     answers which word may stand there. Any path to that program does, since the
//     name at the end of it is the same program.
//
// THE CRITICAL FLOOR STILL STANDS UNDER ALL THREE: one simple command, and not one
// a gate told to allow everything would still stop and put to a person.

// a bare `src/version.py` out of its own acceptance ran `bash -c src/version.py`,
// collected exit 126 from a file with no executable bit, and reported "does not
// pass" about it on every round of a whole evening (#468).
//
// THE TREE IS ASKED BEFORE THE PATH, and that order is a law rather than a
// preference: A FILE THE TREE HOLDS OUTRANKS A PROGRAM OF THE SAME NAME ON PATH.
// A repository that carries its own `check`, `build` or `test` beside the work
// means THAT file, and a lookup that answered first would silently run somebody
// else's program of the same name against somebody else's assumptions — the exact
// shape of wrongness this whole reading exists to remove.
//
// THREE ANSWERS, AND EVERY ONE OF THEM IS A FACT RATHER THAN A LIST:
//
//   - THE SPAN NAMES A FILE AND THE WORK NAMED THE PROGRAM TOO — two words, a
//     launcher and its file — so the program stands exactly as the work wrote it
//     and the file behind it is resolved and quoted like any other. The work is
//     the one citizen entitled to say WHICH program runs its check; it is not the
//     authority on how a shell splits a word, and `sh run'"'"'tests.sh` handed back
//     as written is an unterminated quote rather than a check.
//   - THE SPAN IS THE FILE ALONE: it is opened the way the file itself says it
//     opens, by its executable bit or by the interpreter its first line names, and
//     the RESOLVED path is what goes into the command, because a bare word with no
//     directory in it would send the shell looking down PATH for a file sitting in
//     the tree.
//   - THE TREE HOLDS NOTHING BY THAT NAME AND THE FIRST WORD IS A PROGRAM THE
//     SHELL WOULD FIND ([onThePath]): the span is already a command and stands
//     exactly as the work wrote it.
//
// AND A FILE THAT SAYS NEITHER IS NOT A CHECK. It is data the prose happened to
// backtick, there is no way to run it, and "does not pass" is a sentence about a
// check that RAN — so this answers "" and the caller drops it rather than
// carrying a permanent failure for the life of the session. It answers "" EVEN
// WHEN A PROGRAM OF THAT NAME IS ON THE PATH, because the tree said which file
// was meant and running a different one would be worse than running nothing.

//
// KEPT: every other word — a filter, a package path, a flag — because each of
// them narrows what actually runs, and folding two narrowed checks together
// would quietly drop one somebody asked for. `./internal/tui3` and
// `./internal/tui3/...` are DELIBERATELY TWO COMMANDS: one measures a package
// and the other measures a subtree, and the day they read as one is the day a
// division could hoist away a check nobody else was going to make.

//
//   - WHITESPACE INSIDE A QUOTED ARGUMENT IS COLLAPSED WITH ALL OTHER

//     here. That is inherited from this package's own reading of a command
//     ([refuseOutsideDoor] normalises a command's whitespace the same way), and
//     it is kept the same ON PURPOSE: one reading of what a command is, not two.
//   - `-count=1` AND `-count 1` ARE THE SAME CHECK AND DO NOT FOLD, because
//     folding them means parsing a flag's VALUE — knowing which flags take one
//     and which do not — and a guess at a flag's shape that came out wrong would
