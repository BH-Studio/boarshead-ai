// ── the effort ladder, as this session reads it ─────────────────────────────
//
// THIS FILE IS WHERE EVERY MODEL CALL IN THIS PROCESS LEARNS HOW HARD TO THINK,
// and [Agent.effortFor] is the one function that answers. A spawn site that
// picks its own rung is the defect the ladder was written to end: a person who
// dials a rung expects it to BE the rung, and a call that quietly kept its own
// answer is a knob that does nothing with no way to tell from outside.
//
// The scopes and their order are internal/effort's; nothing about the
// precedence is decided here. What is decided here is which of this session's
// fields fills which scope, and it is this:
//
//	turn         the level dialled onto the model now in use (agent.go's map)
//	conversation the rung this session was set to, kept in meta.json
//	task         the rung set on the work this session IS (Config.Effort)
//	role         what this session is for (Config.EffortRole)
//	default      the install's `effort` row (Config.DefaultEffort)
//
// A child agent — a task worker, a standing firing, an adaptive-run node — is a
// whole session of its own, so the work's rung reaches it as ITS conversation
// rather than as a fifth argument threaded down every call: the child is the
// work, and its own turns are the work being done.

// effortFor is the rung one call on this model should ask for.
//
// It takes the model because the turn scope is held per model id: a step that
// has moved to a fallback asks that model for the level somebody set on IT,
// never for the level dialled onto the model that stopped answering.
