// A RUN THAT CAME TO NOTHING SAYS SO.
//
// Every task firing used to answer "landed" whatever it did, so the marker in
// the run folder never read [standing.OutcomeNothing], the sweep's whole licence
// over a run was never granted, and a watch that ran a headless child every
// night forever kept every one of those folders forever. These pin the rule that
// decides it and one firing end to end with a scripted child.
