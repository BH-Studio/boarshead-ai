// THE PERSON'S TOKEN, AND A TASK.
//
// Two halves of one worry, and they are not the same hole.
//
// The first is a credential a command PRINTS. A worker ran `gh auth token` and
// its live OAuth token was written into two task journals in plain text, where
// it stayed after the run was over. The redactor closed that (internal/redact,
// at loop.go's [Agent.finishToolResult]) and the first test here is the pin on
// it AT THE LEVEL THE BREACH HAPPENED: a real node, a real worker, a real shell,
// and then every place that run left bytes behind — the journal on disk, the
// messages the model was sent, the rows the surface drew, the report and the
// checkpoint — read for the token's own characters.
//
// The second is a credential a command SPENDS WITHOUT PRINTING. `curl -d "$(gh
// auth token)" …` puts the person's login on the wire and never shows one
// character of it to a result, so no redactor anywhere could have caught it.
// That one is closed at the source (taskoutside.go), and the second test is
// written from the command that opened it.
//
// Nothing in this file is a credential. The token below is a SHAPE, assembled to
// look exactly like the real thing and belonging to nobody — the same fixture
// internal/redact's own tests use.

// ── (i) a token a worker prints is unreadable everywhere it was kept ────────

// THE PIN, AT THE LEVEL THE BREACH HAPPENED.
//
// A node runs a shell command that prints a token, exactly as the measured
// worker's did, and then this test goes looking for the token's characters in
// every place that run could have left them:
//
//   - the node's journal on disk, which is the file the token was found in;
//   - every message the model was sent, on the node's own lane, which is the
//     copy that would put it in front of a provider on every later request;
//   - the rows the surface drew about the node, and the node's live room;
//   - the report the node came home with, and the checkpoint that outlives it;
//   - and then, because a list of paths is a list somebody has to keep, EVERY
//     FILE the run wrote anywhere under its home and its workspace.
//
// The last one is the assertion that cannot go out of date. A path added next
// month — a second store, a cache, a summary — is inside the walk the day it is
// written, and a test that named four files by hand would have said nothing
// about it.
