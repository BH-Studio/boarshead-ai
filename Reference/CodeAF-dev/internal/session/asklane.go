// The model's question lane: the book of what it has asked, and the one road an
// answer takes back to it.
//
// AN ANSWER IS A MESSAGE TO THE CONVERSATION THAT ALSO RELEASES A WAITING CALL
// WHEN THERE IS ONE (docs/design/questions/DESIGN.md, "An answer is a message").
// Until this lane existed an answer was only the RETURN VALUE of the `ask` call
// that raised the question — the turn parked on a channel, and an answer that
// arrived with nobody parked went nowhere at all. Three things a person asked
// for are the same shape and none of them could be built on that: carrying on
// while a question stands, a clock that takes the pick when it runs out, and
// changing an answer after it was given. Each is an answer arriving when no call
// is waiting.
//
// So the answer is rendered ONCE ([askAnswerText]) and delivered one of two
// ways: handed to the call parked on it, or put on the conversation's own queue
// through [Agent.accept] — the road a background job's ending, a watch's firing
// and a landed task already take, which lands at the next step boundary and
// starts a turn on an idle conversation. There is no second delivery path, and
// the bytes are the same either way (asklane_test.go holds it).
//
// ── THERE IS ONE BOOK, AND IT IS NOT THIS FILE ──
//
// The book of what the model has asked is [askedOfThePerson] in `askwait.go`
// (#870), and this wave did not write a second beside it: two books holding one
// question was the defect that file's own doc warned about, and the lane's
// account of a question was folded INTO it rather than the other way round. So
// `askwait.go` keeps the map, the channels, the four ways an ask ends and the
// ownership rule that makes them safe; what lives here is everything an answer
// needs AFTER somebody has given one — the rendering, the delivery, the lane's
// clock, the hold, and the revision.
//
// Two of that file's rules are worth knowing at this end, because this file is
// where they are felt. The fourth ending is CARRIED ON: the call never waited
// ([askBlocking]), so there is no channel and the answer is a message whenever
// it comes — the ending the other three had no room for, and the one this wave
// is about. And the ownership moved down one field: a settled entry is KEPT so
// its answer can be changed, so the answer claims `open.wait` rather than the
// map entry ([askedOfThePerson.answerLocked]).
