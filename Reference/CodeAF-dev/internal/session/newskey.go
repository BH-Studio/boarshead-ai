// newskey.go is WHOSE NEWS THIS IS, AND THE DOOR NEWS COMES BACK IN THROUGH.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS FIXES. Bare `codeaf` in a workspace does not run this engine
// in the surface's own process: the surface dials the machine's engine host
// (internal/enginehost) and talks to a `remote.Agent` over a pipe. Everything
// [OnPhaseNews] and [OnLaneNews] carry — the live rate at the right edge of the
// status row, the `via <machine>` rider on the seam, `connecting · 1.2s`,
// `first word …`, `thinking`, `writing`, and the `served` row `/status` prints
// — is posted in the ENGINE'S process and read in the SURFACE'S, and until the
// wire carried it none of it ever arrived. The surface's code for all four was
// right the whole time; there was no road.
//
// TWO THINGS ARE NEEDED TO BUILD THAT ROAD, AND THIS FILE IS BOTH OF THEM.
//
// The first is an IDENTITY. Both readers are process-global — one desk for the
// whole build, because a surface that draws a status line does not hold the
// agent that ran the errand behind it (lanenews.go says why). One process with
// one window needs nothing more; a HOST runs many conversations down many
// connections, registers one reader for all of them, and would fan every
// window's clock out to every other window without a name on each piece of news
// to sort by. [Agent.newsKey] is that name.
//
// The second is a WAY BACK IN. [TellPhase] and [TellLane] are the doors the
// surface's side of the connection hands a decoded frame to, so that a relayed
// piece of news runs the same forwarding an in-process one runs and reaches the
// same registered reader. Nothing else may call them: they are for a transport
// that took the news off a wire.

// newsKey names the conversation a piece of news belongs to.
//
// IT IS THE ROOT CONVERSATION AND NOT THIS AGENT, which is the whole of why it
// is a function rather than a field read. A conversation runs a talk turn, a
// naming errand, and — under it — a tree of task nodes, each of which is an
// agent of its own with its own journal. All of them are one window's work, and
// a node whose phase was filed under its own journal would be news the host
// could not place on the connection the person is sitting at. `rootSession` is
// the answer that already travels down every node's Config for the ledger's
// sake (session.go), so this reads it rather than minting a second lineage that
// could disagree with the one the money is filed under.
//
// A conversation itself carries no root — its own journal names it — so it
// falls back to [Agent.threadID], which is the journal header's id when there
// is a file and the minted lineage id when there is not.

// NewsSubject is the name one piece of work's news is filed under: the
// conversation it is rooted in, and the node inside it.
//
// IT IS EXPORTED BECAUSE BOTH SIDES OF THE SEAM SPELL IT, and there is exactly
// one spelling. The engine stamps it on every phase and every sighting a node
// produces ([Agent.newsSubject]); a surface asks its own desks for the subject
// of the room it has open (internal/tui3's phase.go and lanes.go). Two
// hand-written spellings of one identity is a room that quietly draws nothing
// forever, which is a defect no test would name.
//
// THE CONVERSATION IS PART OF THE NAME BECAUSE NODE IDS RESTART. Every
// conversation counts its work from one, so `7` alone would alias — and a
// window CAN be looking at two conversations' node 7 at once, which is exactly
// what a guest room is (internal/tui3's taskGuest, whose own comment says a
// per-task key must be built this way for the same reason).
//
// A CONVERSATION THAT CANNOT NAME ITSELF NAMES NOTHING. An empty conversation
// gives an empty subject, which reads as "the conversation" everywhere a
// subject is read — the honest answer, because a subject nobody can scope is a
// subject that would collide with somebody else's.

// cannot name a conversation fans nothing out to it rather than fanning

// [forwardPhase] — the same forwarding the in-process road runs — so a relayed
// phase lands on the same desk, wakes the same repaint, and is aged out by the
// same window as one measured here.
//
// IT CANNOT DOUBLE-POST. A build where the engine and the surface share a
// process has no connection between them, so nothing ever calls this; a build
// where they do not share a process has two readers in two processes and each
// posts once. The [PhaseNews.Relayed] stamp the caller sets is what keeps a
// build that is BOTH — a test driving a host inside its own process — from
// sending back out what it just took in.
