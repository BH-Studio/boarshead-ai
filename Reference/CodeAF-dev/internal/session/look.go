// The LOOK STAMP: when somebody last stood in front of home.
//
// Home's one genuinely new answer over the world itself is the delta — "what
// landed while I was not looking" — and a delta needs an origin. This is that
// origin: one RFC3339 instant in a dotfile beside the project buckets, written
// when home closes and read when it opens. Work that finished after the stamp
// is news; work that finished before it has been seen.
//
// IT IS WRITTEN ON THE WAY OUT AND NOT ON THE WAY IN. A stamp taken when the
// screen opens would declare everything seen the moment it appeared, before a
// person's eye had crossed a single row; closing is the first instant "they
// looked" is actually true. A window that dies with home open writes nothing,
// and the next open marks the same work as news again — repeating news is the
// harmless direction to fail in.
//
// A machine with no stamp yet has no origin, and a delta with no origin is not
// a delta: the first look marks NOTHING as news, rather than everything. That
// is [LastLook] answering zero and every caller treating zero as "no claim".

// ── one stamp per place ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE ONE STAMP ABOVE CANNOT ANSWER "TWO THINGS CHANGED IN MEMORY". It is one
// instant for the whole machine, written when home closes, so it means *since
// you last shut the screen* and nothing narrower. A tab bar that wore a count
// against it would say the same number about every place at once: open home,
// glance at the task list for ten minutes, and memory still claims two new
// things because the machine-wide stamp has not moved.
//
// So a place gets its own stamp, written when that place is left. Seven small
// instants in ONE small file rather than seven files, because they are read
// together — a tab bar asks about all of them on the same beat — and because
// seven dotfiles beside the project buckets is seven things a person has to
// wonder about.
//
// IT DOES NOT REPLACE THE STAMP ABOVE AND IT MUST NOT. [LastLook] is what the
// whole surface's "since you left" ledger is measured from, it is written by a
// path this file does not touch, and it goes on meaning exactly what it meant.
// A place with no stamp of its own falls back to nothing — zero, "no claim" —
// and a caller that wants the machine-wide origin instead asks for it by name.
//
// The same failure direction as the stamp above: a lost write, a torn file, two
// windows closing at once and one overwriting the other's map — every one of
// them costs a place its origin, and a place with no origin marks NOTHING as
// news rather than everything.

// looksStampName is the per-place file, beside [lookStampName]. It is JSON
// rather than one line per file because it is a map and JSON is what this
// codebase writes maps in.
const looksStampName = "looks.json"

// being the document itself so that a later reader of this file can add a

//
