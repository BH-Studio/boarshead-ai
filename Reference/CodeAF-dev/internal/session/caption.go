// The line over a batch of work.
//
// Most captions cost no second call: the surface lifts the short narrating line
// the working model already wrote before its tools, or composes an honest floor
// from the batch's targets. Thinking is never a caption — it is machinery under
// the step. This file owns the last rung: a cheap narrator that names the
// discrete step while the batch runs, cancelled when the batch ends so a late
// answer cannot rewrite a settled title.
//
// TWO THINGS TRAVEL WITH THE SENTENCE, and both are here because they are
// decided here. The FAMILY of work is a one-word prefix on the same answer
// (actioncategory.go), so the surface's one still mark costs no second call. The
// ANCHOR is the batch's first call id, and it is what makes the cancellation
// above a fence rather than a hope: the check is a race — this goroutine can
// pass it and then be descheduled past the end of its own batch — so the event
// names the step it is about and a surface holding a different step drops it.
//
// AND THE LINE IS JOURNALED. A caption is not a message; nothing was said to the
// model, so there is nothing in the transcript to recover it from, and a
// conversation reopened without a `caption` line falls back to recomposing a
// title out of tool names — which turns "starting the local server" into
// "running 1 command" and a step the narrator called a `test` into a `run`.
// [sessionFile.appendCaption] writes it against the same anchor the event
// carries, so the record and the stream name the step the same way.
