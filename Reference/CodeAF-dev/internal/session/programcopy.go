// A PROGRAM IN A REPOSITORY WORKS IN A COPY OF ITS OWN.
//
// THE CONTRACT, for a folder that is a git repository (programfolder.go keeps
// the rest — which folder, a plain folder, the refusals):
//
//  1. THE COPY IS A GIT WORKTREE IN A PRIVATE FOLDER OF CODEAF'S — under this
//     account's cache folder ([programCopyRoot]), never inside the person's
//     repository, and never in a shared temporary folder another account can
//     reach first or a restart empties — cut on a branch of the program's own
//     ([taskBranchName]) from the commit the person's checkout stands on. It is
//     not for the person to open: it exists so that several runs can work on
//     one repository at once, and so that the person's own checkout, index and
//     branch are never touched.
//  2. THE COPY STARTS WHERE THE PERSON IS, UNCOMMITTED CHANGES AND ALL. What
//     their checkout tracks but has not committed — edits, staged or not,
//     and staged new files — is written into one commit on top of the one their
//     checkout stands on, through an index of codeaf's own, and the program's
//     branch begins with it ([ProgramFolder.snapshotLeftBehind]). Their index,
//     their files and their branch are only read, and the changes stay
//     uncommitted in their folder as they were. A checkout in the middle of a
//     merge or a rebase is not carried — its files hold conflict markers — and
//     neither is anything when git cannot read it; the run is not refused for
//     either, and the receipt and a shell run's first lines say which it was
//     ([ProgramFolder.LeftBehindWords]). Untracked files are copied as local
//     inputs, excluded from automatic commits and submission snapshots.
//  3. A FEW FOLDERS GIT IGNORES ARE LINKED IN, NOT COPIED ([programCopyLinks]):
//     installed dependencies and environment files the project's own build
//     and tests need and a fresh checkout does not have — `node_modules`, a
//     `.venv`, a `.env`. Build output is never linked, because two runs
//     building into one folder corrupt each other, and neither is anything
//     else: a `bin/` linked in once had a run's `make build` overwrite the
//     binary its person was running. A project names its own list in
//     `.codeaf/config.json` ([config.ProjectProgramLinks]). A link git would
//     not otherwise ignore is named in the repository's exclude file only
//     while a copy of it is on disk ([excludeLinkedNames]).
//  4. WHEN THE PROGRAM EXITS — done, not finished, stopped, crashed, or its
//     process gone — what it left uncommitted on its branch is committed there,
//     the copy is removed and git's record of it pruned, so THE BRANCH IS
//     RELEASED: checked out nowhere, and free for the person, a merge, or the
//     next run of the same work. THE BRANCH IS ALWAYS KEPT, even when the run
//     changed nothing. What cannot be committed on it — the program moved the
//     copy off its branch, or left a merge half done — is kept as a patch in the
//     run's record folder instead of being lost with the copy, and commits it
//     made on no branch are put on one. NOTHING THE PROGRAM LEFT IS DELETED
//     UNSAVED: a copy whose leftovers could be neither committed nor kept is
//     left where it is, and the ending says where ([ProgramFolderEnd.CopyKept]).
//  5. A RUN WHOSE PROCESS WENT AWAY IS FINISHED THE SAME WAY by the next codeaf
//     that finds it: the conversation that reopens it, or the next program run
//     on the same repository ([sweepProgramCopies]). Unlike a folder a person
//     works in, nobody else's edits can be in a copy, so committing what is in
//     it is committing the run's own work. And the program is not still making
//     it: the hold on the copy is handed to the program's own process
//     ([ProgramFolder.Hold]), so a codeaf that died leaves the program its
//     grace to stop, and its copy is finished only once the program is gone.
