package session

// THE ADAPTIVE RUN, from this side of the wall.
//
// internal/orchestrate owns the shape: a planner that only amends and a
// scheduler that only launches, one fuel tank, digests between nodes. It owns
// no model, no tools and no worktree, because none of those are shapes. THIS
// FILE IS WHERE THEY ARE SUPPLIED — and the whole of it is three seams and the
// doorways a surface reaches them through:
//
//	the planner    one non-streamed model call per completion, held to an
//	               amendment by the salvage ladder and one repair turn — the
//	               same bargain a harness design is held to (harness_build.go)
//	the executor   one node = one child agent in the session's own loop, with
//	               its write scope enforced by the control plane and its
//	               worktree resolved through [Config.WorktreePath]
//	the lanes      notes, the gauge and the fuel gate go out on a standing
//	               subscription ([Agent.Orchestrations]), never on a turn's hub
//
// THE RUN OUTLIVES ITS TURN, which is the fact every other decision here bends
// around. A turn that asks for one ends immediately — a conversation frozen
// for twenty minutes on work the person can watch is not a conversation — so
// the run holds a context of its own, is registered so [Agent.Close] can end
// it, and reports back through the standing lane and an ambient note. That is
// the arrangement a designed harness already uses one file over, for the same
// reason.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE, AND IS NOT ANYWHERE ELSE EITHER: A DOOR. Nothing in this
// file decides that a turn wanted a run, because NO CHAT TURN CAN OPEN ONE AT
// ALL any more. There were three ways in and all three are closed — the model's
// `run_adaptive` hand, which went with the wave that left ordinary work one road
// (a planner guessing the parts from a request it can only read lost to a worker
// that opens the material first, task_divide.go); `/task adaptive`, retired with
// the preference that spelled it; and last the anchored cue, a lookup on the head
// of what somebody typed, which is now gone too (loop.go states the whole of it).
// Typing `orchestrate the migration` is an ordinary turn today: absence, not
// refusal.
//
// SO WHO STILL DRIVES THE ENGINE. cmd/harness-design, on a driver of its own
// straight onto internal/orchestrate. /subharness is NOT a second answer and is
// worth naming so nobody looks for one: a saved program is a task node started
// by its own runner (subharness_contract.go's startSubharnessRun) and it never
// enters this file. So what stands below is the whole of what a conversation
// would need to hold a run — the doorways, the fuel gate's answer, the snapshot
// and the steering a room draws, the roster family — with no chat-side caller
// left. IT IS KEPT DELIBERATELY: those seams are exercised by this package's
// tests, a surface would come back in through exactly them, and taking the organ
// out is a separate decision nobody has made. Where a piece here has no caller
// at all, it says so where it stands.

// THE TURN THAT ASKED FOR ONE STOOD HERE, and it is gone. An anchored cue read
// the head of what somebody typed — `orchestrate …`, `adaptively work on …` —
// stripped the courtesies off it, took the money and the model clause out of the
// sentence, and started a run with what was left. It was a lookup and never a
// judgement, and it was still the last way a conversation could reach a planned
// graph, which is a thing this product has decided a conversation does not do
// (loop.go carries the whole statement). The parser went with it: nothing in this
// package reads a person's sentence for a run any more.
//
// What is left below is the announcement a run makes when one is started, kept
// for the reason everything else on this side is kept.

// announceOrchestrate says one run has started, on the standing lane where
// every other thing that run will say arrives. It is the FIRST NEWS OF A RUN and
// the only line a surface has to go on: a run is not a node, so it is on no
// roster and has no row, and this event is what tells a surface one exists at
// all (internal/tui3's roomorch.go).
//
// NOBODY CALLS IT TODAY — the cue that stood above it was its one caller — and
// it stands for the reason the rest of the engine's chat-side wiring stands: a
// surface that starts a run through [Config.OrchestrateRunner] still needs the
// line, and the tui3 reader that draws it is untouched.
//
// THE ID IS THE RUN'S NUMBER, AND A RUNNER MAY NOT HAVE ONE. Every question in
// this package is answered by [Event.ID], which is a uint64, and the engine here
// mints its ids as decimal numbers written out ([Agent.RunOrchestrate]) — so the
// number goes back on the event. A surface that was handed a runner minting ids
// of some other shape gets ID zero, which every reader already treats as "this
// names no run": the note still lands in the conversation, and what it costs is
// the page, which could not have been opened on an id the session cannot resolve
// anyway. The error is read rather than dropped so that this is a decision on

const orchestratePlannerLaw = `You plan an adaptive run. You never do the work.

You are called once at the start and once every time a node finishes. Each
time you see the goal, what has finished (as short digests), the frontier, the
fuel, and anything the person has typed at the run. You answer with ONE JSON
object and nothing else — no prose, no code fence.

THE WHOLE VOCABULARY:

  {"add": [{"id": "n3", "goal": "...", "needs": ["n1"], "write_scope": ["path"], "worktree": false, "verify": ""}],
   "cancel": [{"id": "n4", "reason": "..."}],
   "note": "one line about what you are doing",
   "done": {"brief": "what the write-up should say"}}

Every key is optional. {} is a complete answer and it is the RIGHT answer most
of the time: a node finished, nothing about the plan changed, say nothing.

THE RULES:

- A NODE IS SMALL. One question, one artifact, a handful of turns. Parallelism
  comes from having many nodes, never from a big one. A node whose goal has an
  "and" in it is two nodes.
- A NODE'S GOAL IS SELF-CONTAINED. It is read by a worker who cannot see this
  conversation, the other nodes, or you. Never write "see above" or "as
  discussed".
- NEEDS ARE ONLY FOR REAL DEPENDENCIES: this node cannot start until that one's
  finding exists. Two nodes with no edge between them run at the same time, so
  every edge you add that was not necessary is time somebody waits for nothing.
- WRITE_SCOPE IS THE PATHS A NODE MAY WRITE. Nodes that only read leave it out.
  Two nodes that write the same path are serialized for you — you do not need
  an edge for that.
- YOU MAY NOT CANCEL A RUNNING NODE. Cancel is for work that has not started.
  A finished node is a fact.
- IDS ARE MINTED ONCE. Never reuse one, never rename one.
- SAY DONE WHEN THE GOAL IS ANSWERED, not when the frontier is empty: a run
  that has what it needs should stop, and the brief you write is what the
  write-up is asked for.
- THE FUEL IS ONE TANK for the whole run, your own calls included. When it is
  low, add only what the goal cannot be answered without.
- A NODE THAT WROTE NOTHING FAILED, whatever its digest reads like. A node given
  a write_scope that ends without writing anything comes back failed, and its
  digest begins "INCOMPLETE: nothing was written". A worker announcing what it is
  about to do is not a worker that did it — read those digests as unfinished
  work, never as a deliverable.
- THE SAME FILE IS NOT SENT OUT FOREVER. Once %d nodes aimed at one path have
  come back without writing it, the run stops taking new nodes for that path and
  goes straight to the write-up. Sending the identical brief a third time is not
  a plan. Change what is being asked for — a smaller piece, a different worker,
  or a different path — or say done and let the write-up say honestly which part
  of the goal is incomplete.`

// ── the write scope ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// writeGuard is the control plane's citizen for [Config.writeScope]: an agent
// that was given a slice of the tree may write in that slice and nowhere else.
//
// IT IS A HOOK AND NOT A SENTENCE IN THE BRIEF, and that is the whole point. A
// scope written into a prompt is a request; a scope on the pre-action seam is
// the one moment every execution passes through (hooks.go), so an agent that
// wandered is refused by the harness rather than trusted not to wander. The
// refusal is a result the model READS — it can pick a different file and carry
// on — because a veto that ended the turn would cost it its work.
//
// IT HAS TWO CITIZENS and they want it for opposite reasons. A node of an
// adaptive run is scoped so that nodes running in DIFFERENT places do not both
// claim the same corner of the plan; a quick task is scoped so that quick tasks
// running in THE SAME working copy cannot collide at all, which is what stands
// in for the worktree a quick task does not get.
//
// IT BINDS THE CALLS WHOSE TARGET IS A KNOWN PATH — edit, write, and the three
// edit_video actions that write the file they name (recovery.go's [mutatedPath],
// which is where that condition is stated). It is asked of the CALL rather than
// of the verb because the newest of the three is four operations behind one
// name, and while it was bound by name alone it was bound by nothing at all: a
// node scoped to `assets/` could cut a film straight over `src/release.mp4`,
// which is a truncation this guard exists to make impossible.
//
// TWO THINGS REMAIN OUT OF REACH AND ARE NAMED RATHER THAN PAPERED OVER. bash,
// because a shell command's effects are whatever it did and a guard that
// pattern-matched commands would be claiming a guarantee it cannot keep. And a
// write that names no path — edit_video called without one lands under a
// timestamped name in the session's own video folder, which nothing can read out
// of the arguments, so that call goes unscoped exactly as generate_image's does.

// ── the run as a task FAMILY ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A run is work a person handed over, exactly as a task is, and until this
// section existed it was the one kind of work with no row anywhere: the roster
// draws tasks, the run drew a note in the conversation and a page somebody had
// to know to open. So a run registers itself with the tasker — one row for the
// RUN, one per node under it — and the roster's tree has a family to draw
// (internal/tui3's taskstrip.go, whose parent seam this fills).
//
// IT REGISTERS AND IT DOES NOT ADMIT. Nothing here calls [TaskGraph.admit]:
// admission is what STARTS work, and a node's work is already running in this
// package's own executor. What the family reuses is the tasker's id sequence
// (so no run's row can ever collide with a task's) and [Agent.emitTaskUpdate],
// which is the one lane every surface reads a task's life from. What it
// deliberately does not reach is the rest of a node's afterlife — the project
// index and the note the model reads when work lands — because a run already
// says what it came to, once, in its own write-up, and a model told twelve
// times that a node finished would report each of them.
//
// WHAT THAT COSTS, said plainly: the ids these rows carry name nothing in the
// task graph, so a surface that offers to open a node's room or stop it by id
// will find no node there. The run's own page is where a node is read and
// steered ([Agent.OrchestrateSnapshot], [Agent.SteerOrchestrate]), and the row
// is a row.
//
// WHAT THE GRAPH DOES HOLD IS THE ROWS THEMSELVES, and that is not admission.
// Every notice this family publishes goes through one door
// ([orchestrateFamily.publish]) which hands the family's rows to
// [TaskGraph.keepRunRows] — not as nodes, which would make them schedulable, but
// as the last thing said about each row. That buys the two things a row that
// exists only at the instant it moves cannot have: it is REPLAYED to a lane that
// opens late ([Agent.replayTaskRoster]), so a surface that detached and came back
// gets the family whole; and it is WRITTEN DOWN with the graph (task_store.go's
// [runRecord]), so a conversation reopened tomorrow redraws yesterday's runs
// settled instead of showing an empty column beside a transcript full of them.
// The run itself still does not survive the process — nothing here resumes one.

// orchestrateFamily is one run's rows: the root, the id minted for each node,
// and the last state each was published in — which is the whole of what makes
// this ONE UPSERT PER STATE CHANGE rather than one per publish. A run publishes
// on every launch, landing, note and steer, and a roster redrawing twelve rows
// for a note is a roster nobody can read.
