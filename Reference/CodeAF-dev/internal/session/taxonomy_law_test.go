// ── THE BOUNDARY IS A BOUNDARY ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// These are structural tests, in this package's own convention (landing_test.go
// scans the sources with go/ast and holds the package to a law rather than to a
// behaviour). They exist because the failure the response boundary was written
// for was NOT a bug in any one site: it was three sites each answering "what did
// that failure mean" its own way, and a fourth site added next year would answer
// it a fourth way unless something says no.
//
// So: one file classifies, and one file buys a stronger model. A change that
// adds an escalation trigger somewhere else fails here with the line number.

// boundaryFile is the one file in this package allowed to ask the taxonomy
// anything or to buy a tier with the answer.
const boundaryFile = "taxonomy_boundary.go"

// tierBuyers are the functions that put a piece of work on a DEARER MODEL than
// the one it was on, and every one of them must be called from the boundary and
// from nowhere else.
//
//   - nextNodeModel walks the adapter's fallback chain for a node whose run
//     ended on a provider failure (task_run.go). It is the site that read four
//     consecutive transport 400s as the model being unable and moved a whole
//     task onto a model seven times the price.
//   - repairModel resolves the careful tier for a repair round (repair_role.go).
//     It is the site that bought that tier on the FIRST finding, whether or not
//     the round it judged had lost its calls on the wire.
//   - terminalProviderFailure is the test those two used to be gated on. It is
//     in the list because a caller that asked it directly would be classifying
//     by hand, which is the habit this whole mechanism replaces.
