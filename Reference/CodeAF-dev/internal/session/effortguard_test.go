// ── THE LAW: ONE PLACE EFFORT COMES FROM ────────────────────────────────────
//
// The ladder is only worth having if it is the ONLY answer. A spawn site that
// decides for itself how hard its model should think is not a small local
// judgment — it is a knob that does nothing, silently, for whoever turned it,
// with no way to tell from the outside which of the two it is.
//
// The engine's model calls are spread over a dozen files here (a turn, a task
// worker, an errand, a firing, a sentinel, a design round), and the next one is
// always one file away. So this is a test rather than a paragraph: a lane that
// adds a stamp has to come here and say which it is, and the two lists below are
// the whole of what is allowed.

// ladderStampers are the files that stamp a rung from the ladder, and every one
// of them must ASK the ladder rather than answer for itself.
//
// The check is that the same file also resolves — through [Agent.effortFor],
// [Agent.effortLocked] or effort.Resolve — because a file that stamps without
// resolving has picked its own rung, which is exactly the defect.
var ladderStampers = map[string]string{

	"standing_run.go": "a firing's sentinel, at the standing role's own floor",
}

// legacyEffortStampers are the calls that still speak the ADAPTER'S older
// vocabulary — provider.Effort, carried on a crew tier value or a harness phase
// — rather than a rung on the ladder.
//
// They are not a backlog and they are not wrong: a tier suffix is a narrower
// notation with three levels of its own (internal/roles), and a harness phase
// default is a decision about one call shape rather than about a person's
// depth. What this list buys is that the boundary is DELIBERATE. A new spawn
// site cannot join it by accident, because joining it means editing this map and
// writing down which of the two things the call is.
