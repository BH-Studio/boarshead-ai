// worktree, because "the events a person sees are the child's own, as they
// happen" is not a claim a stubbed graph can make: the whole seam under test is
// the fan-out inside runTaskChild. The refusals are exercised against a stubbed
// runner, because "no such task" and "that one is over" are the room's own law
// and want neither a provider nor git.
