// WHERE A STOPPED PROGRAM'S WORK GOES.
//
// A stop ends a program's run the way every ending of it ends: its copy
// finished (programcopy.go), with what it had left uncommitted committed on
// its own branch, the copy removed so the branch is checked out nowhere, and
// the person's checkout untouched. A stop that changed nothing keeps its
// branch too, and the person is told at once where the work will be.
