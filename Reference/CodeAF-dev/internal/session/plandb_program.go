// A PROGRAM'S TASK IS READ AS THE ACTIONS IT TOOK. A task a run handed to a
// program codeaf carries (senior-dev first; internal/delegate) is drawn as what
// the program did, step by step through its own process: every stage, step and
// ending it reported, which the run's worker writes to the task's action log
// as each arrives (delegate.ActionsFile), read through the program's own
// vocabulary for them (delegate.Delegate's Present). Beside them the page
// carries the program's calls to a model — every one of which goes through the
// model API codeaf serves the run, which writes each as one turn into the
// task's own record folder (delegate.ConversationFile) — because the calls
// know two things the actions do not always say (a compaction, a change of
// model) and because the raw calls stay one key away on the page. This file is
// the reading side of both for the task page: whose run it is, the stages it
// said it would move through, the step it is in now, its actions and its
// turns, cut to what a page draws.
//
// NOTHING HERE WRITES. The run's worker writes the program record when the
// program says hello (delegate.ProgramFile) and the action log as the records
// arrive, and the model API writes the turns; this file reads all three,
// inside the page read the surface already makes off its loop
// ([Agent.PlanTaskPage]) and the row read the side list already makes on its
// beat ([Agent.PlanTasks]), and never on a frame.
