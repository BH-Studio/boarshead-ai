// PROMOTING A RUNNING FOREGROUND COMMAND INTO A JOB.
//
// A foreground `bash` call used to be committed at the moment it was made. When
// the command turned out to be a fifteen-minute build, the timeout killed the
// process group, the call answered `Command timed out after N seconds`, and the
// only way forward was to run the whole thing AGAIN with background:true. The
// elapsed work thrown away, every time, for a judgement nobody could make in
// advance: no model and no person knows which side of the line `make` falls on
// until it is already past it.
//
// So a call that hits its bound is now ADOPTED rather than killed. The process
// keeps running, the registry takes it over, and the call answers
//
//	still running as job 3; log at /path/to/.codeaf/jobs/3.log
//
// followed by everything the command has printed so far ([promotedSentence]).
// The first line is the sentence a background start already speaks
// (tools_jobs.go). From there it is a job in every way that matters — a row in
// `jobs list`, a tail in `jobs output`, a kill that reaches its whole process
// group, a death at Close, and an exit note carrying its output on the steering
// lane at the next step boundary. Nothing new was invented; one existing
// capability grew one door.
//
// THE FIRST ARMED BOUND WINS. The session's background-after clock normally
// makes the handoff; the command's own timeout may make it sooner. With the
// session clock off, the timeout-only posture remains exactly as it was.
//
// ── WHERE THE SEAM IS, AND WHY THERE ──
//
// Two things had to stay where they were.
//
// THE TIMEOUT LAW IS ONE READ, and it is [BashTimeoutSeconds]: the wrapper
// writes it into the wire arguments and bare arms one timer from those
// arguments. The session clock is armed here from the one Config value, and
// [BashBoundSeconds] lets the surface count down against whichever comes first.
//
// PROCESS OWNERSHIP IS ONE REGISTRY, and it is [jobRegistry]. bare must not
// grow a second reaper: everything that decides a process is over — the settle,
// the note, the kill, the shutdown — lives in jobs.go, and a second place that
// knew how to end a process would be a second set of rules about which deaths
// are reported.
//
// So bare keeps the timer and the exec.Cmd frame, and offers the RUNNING call
// through a door in the context (internal/exec/bare's promote.go). This file
// implements that door. bare never learns what a job is; the registry never
// learns what a timeout is.
//
// The one thing that could not be moved is the wait: Go permits exactly one
// cmd.Wait per command and bash's is already in flight when a promotion
// happens. So the registry does not wait on an adopted process — it reads the
// exit code off the channel bare's existing waiter feeds, and settles it the way
// it settles everything else ([jobRegistry.settleExit]).
//
// ── THE DECISIONS AT THE EDGES ──
//
// AN INTERRUPT IS STILL AN INTERRUPT. esc cancels the turn's context, and a call
// whose context is cancelled cannot be adopted — bare refuses it inside the
// claim. A person who asked for the work to stop does not get a job that
// outlives the turn they just ended.
//
// A BACKGROUND CALL IS NEVER PROMOTED, because it never reaches here: the door
// is installed only on the foreground branch of [Agent.backgroundBash], so a
// call that asked for background:true went to [jobRegistry.start] and was a job
// from the first instant. The guard is the branch, and it is stated at the
// branch.
//
// CLOSE KILLS A PROMOTED JOB LIKE ANY OTHER. Between the promotion and the exit
// it is an ordinary row in the registry, so [jobRegistry.shutdown] claims it,
// SIGTERMs it, and kills it after the shared grace (jobs.go). Its death is
// requested, so no note lands on a queue whose journal is about to close.
//
// A TASK NODE PROMOTES THE SAME WAY. `watch` comes off a node's belt because a
// watch's whole delivery mechanism is a note arriving in a conversation and a
// node has none — but `jobs` does not, and never has: a node has a steering lane
// of its own, drains it at its own step boundaries, and a node whose `make` runs
// long is in exactly the bind this file exists to end. So the behaviour is the
// same in a node, deliberately, and the only difference is who reads the note.

// promotedSentence is what a promoted call answers with: the line
// [Agent.backgroundBash] already speaks for a background start — an id and a
// path — and then THE OUTPUT THE COMMAND HAS ALREADY PRODUCED.
//
// ── WHY THE OUTPUT IS HERE AND NOT LEFT IN THE LOG ──
//
// The id and the path used to be the whole answer, on the reasoning that the
// model could go and read the rest. What that cost was measured: a model handed
// a bare id has learned nothing about the work, so its next move is to look at
// the log — and a command that is still running has usually printed the part
// that matters (the plan, the first failures, the progress) long before it
// exits. Handing that back with the id turns a promotion from a question into an
// answer, and the commonest next call from a model that reads a promotion — go
// and tail this — stops being worth making.
//
// It is bounded by [bare.TailForResult], which is the SAME truncation this
// command's own result would have been cut by had it finished: last whole lines
// inside pi's line and byte caps. A promoted call and a finished one are the
// same command, so the amount of it the model may read is the same number.
//
// THE ID LEADS. Everything downstream reads this sentence from the front — the
// surface, the tests, a person's eye — and a tail of build output above it would
// bury the one fact that says what happened.
//
// BashPromotedLead is exported because the surface has to recognize this one
// result without inventing a second spelling of it. The composer and every
// reader share the same lead; the job id and the rest of the sentence remain
