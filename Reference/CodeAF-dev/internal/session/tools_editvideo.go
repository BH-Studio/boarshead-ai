// edit_video: the local, free, deterministic half of video work — as against
// generate_video (tools_video.go), which buys one short clip at a time from a
// provider and takes minutes to do it.
//
// ── WHY THIS VERB EXISTS AT ALL ──
//
// Every video longer than one render is an assembly job: several clips laid end
// to end, a frame carried out of each one to open the next so the shots connect,
// and a score laid underneath. Those four operations were, until this file,
// ffmpeg command lines the model wrote into bash — and the manual said so,
// because that was the truth.
//
// It went wrong in a way nobody could see. The obvious join carries the FIRST
// input's audio and silently drops every other clip's, so the cut plays, looks
// right, and goes quiet after the first shot; the obvious mix halves the sound
// already in the clip, because amix normalizes unless told not to; and fitting a
// piece of music to a cut meant measuring both and looping or trimming by hand.
// None of those failures errors. All of them are audible and only audible.
// internal/video carries the fixes structurally — a join there cannot come out
// silent, because there is no branch in which the audio is not mapped — and this
// file is the wire that hands them to the model.
//
// ── ABSENT-NOT-BROKEN, ON A MACHINE FACT RATHER THAN A SETTING ──
//
// The verb is on the belt when ffmpeg and ffprobe are on PATH and off it when
// they are not (design-law: a capability that cannot work is absent, not broken).
// That gate is a fact about the machine and NOT a fact about the person's
// settings, which is the one interesting difference from the four making verbs:
// edit_video needs no model, no key and no money, so it is present on a machine
// that cannot generate a single frame — where it is still the right way to cut
// together footage the person already has.

//
// So the description carries exactly the facts that change what the model DOES
// and hands the rest to the manual, which is a tool it can call: the four
// actions, the audio law — stated as a promise, because a model that does not
// know it will write the filter graph itself and the graph it writes drops the
// sound — the frame-chaining trick, and the two figures. Everything else, the
// arguments in full and every refusal's wording, is one `manual` call away.
