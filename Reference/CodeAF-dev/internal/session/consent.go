package session

// The approval gate: the moment between "the model asked for a tool" and "the
// tool ran".
//
// The policy itself is internal/approval — a pure function from a call to
// allow, prompt or deny, with the dangerous cases decided by MATCHING rather
// than by a model's judgement about its own request. This file is the other
// half: where that answer is asked for, and what happens to each of the three.
//
//   - ALLOW runs the call, exactly as before this file existed.
//   - DENY returns an ordinary error tool result naming the rule. The model
//     reads it, knows the call did not run, and can do something else. A refusal
//     it can act on is worth more than a refusal that ends the turn.
//   - PROMPT emits EventConsentRequest and BLOCKS the call — not the turn's
//     other tools, which run in their own goroutines — until the person answers
//     or the turn's context dies.
//
// ── WHY CONSENT IS NEVER JOURNALED ──
//
// The session file is the record of what was DONE: messages sent, tools run,
// results returned, compaction passes taken. A consent request is a question
// about work that has not happened yet, and a denied call never ran at all —
// journaling it would put an event in the transcript that no message
// corresponds to, and a resume would replay a question whose moment is gone.
// So consent is events only, and the record shows the two things that are true
// afterwards: either the tool result, or the refusal the model was handed.
//
// ── WHY THE MEMO IS NOT A SETTING ──
//
// "Don't ask me again" (ConsentToolSession) lives in memory for this agent's
// life and is written nowhere. A session-scoped answer that survived the
// session would be a policy change the person never made, in a file they did
// not open. The place to change the policy is the policy.

	// that is wider than anything the card ever promised: a card that said

	// The honest consequence, stated here because it is surprising: this scope

// ── AND THEN THE PERSON'S OWN WORD ABOUT THE ACCOUNT ──
//
// A call against one of their accounts has a second thing said about it: the

// (connectcaps.go). It is applied AFTER the policy and it moves the answer by at
// most one rung, in one direction each:
//
//   - YES is the person's named allow. It is worth exactly what a
//     `gmail_send:allow` rule is worth — and it is worth that for the same
//     reason, that somebody wrote it about that tool — so it lifts a prompt to
//     an allow, INCLUDING the floor internal/approval holds under a blanket
//     allow for calls that act in their name. That floor exists because a
//     blanket allow cannot vouch for a message it has not seen; this is not a
//     blanket allow.
//   - ASK is a floor of its own, and it applies to any capability rather than
//     only to the ones that act: a person who sets "read your mail" to ask first
//     is asking to be asked, and a policy that allowed everything would
//     otherwise silently ignore the only control they were given.
//
// NEITHER TOUCHES A DENY. A rule that refuses outright is a refusal, and a word
// on a settings row is not a licence to overrule it. Off is not here at all —
// it is answered before this, in [Agent.approve], because a capability that is
