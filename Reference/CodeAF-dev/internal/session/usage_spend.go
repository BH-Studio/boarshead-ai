// READING THE USAGE LEDGER: three questions and one control.
//
// Screen 2c asks three things of the same rows and nothing else: which days,
// which models, and what the money was FOR. Screen 3d says how a person moves
// between them — two arrow axes, `shift+←→` for which window and `shift+↑↓` for
// how coarse — so that no letter is spent on time.
//
// Everything here is a PURE FUNCTION over lines a page already has. Nothing in
// this file opens a file, takes a lock or looks at a clock that was not handed
// to it: the read is [UsageCache.Read]'s and the drawing is the page's, and
// arithmetic that sits between them must be callable on a three-second beat
// without anybody having to think about it.
//
// THE EMPTINESS LAW IS THE PAGE'S TO APPLY, NOT THIS FILE'S, and the split is
// deliberate. [UsageByDay] returns a bucket for every day in the window
// INCLUDING the days nothing was spent, because a sparkline that silently
// dropped its quiet days would draw a fortnight as a week and read as busier
// than the fortnight was. Those zero buckets are honest data; what a page must
// not do is print `$0.00` under them. The two are different rules and this one
// is the reader's half.

// ── one node and everything under it ────────────────────────────────────────

// Receipt is what one node cost, in the three readings every spend surface in
// this program wants — and it is ONE OBJECT, computed in ONE PLACE
// ([UsageTree]), because the alternative is what issue #269 measured: the card,
// the roster and the spend place quoting three different costs for the same
// piece of work, each summing the same rows a slightly different way.
//
// A SURFACE CHOOSES WHAT TO SHOW AND NEVER WHAT TO SUM. The status line's money
// segment and Settings→Spending's `this one` show [Receipt.Folded]; /cost prints
// Direct beside Children under it — readings of one arithmetic, rather than one
// arithmetic per surface.
//
// THE SPLIT IS THE POINT AND THE FOLDED FIGURE IS THE HEADLINE. The defect the
// split answers (issue #145) is a conversation whose ambient figure read $2.53
// while the tasks it had started were spending $51.05 — the smaller number,
// alone, for two hours, because a node's money only reaches the node's own books
// when the child closes. Folded is the honest one; the halves are what makes it
// auditable rather than a figure that jumped.

	// including the checks and the repair rounds — and the hands a turn forked,

	// task, and are counted here because they are money the node's books do not
	// hold until they come home. It is what those books will eventually hold as
	// each piece of work closes, and it is here now.

// than adding a running total of its own. A fold writes no ledger line
// ([Agent.addFoldedUsage]), so a node's calls are here under the node that made
// them whether the node is still running or closed an hour ago — and a reader
// that added this to a conversation's own books would count a closed node
// twice. The books and this are two readings of the same money, not two
// quantities to add.
//
// A LINE BELONGS TO THE WORK WHENEVER IT NAMES A ROOT, and to the conversation
// only when it names the conversation itself. That ordering matters at exactly
// one point: a conversation whose journal id somehow appeared as a root would
// otherwise be counted in both halves.

// An empty conversation id matches nothing at all rather than everything, which
// is the honest answer for a surface that does not know which conversation it
