// The subharness contract, session side: the three doors every surface in the
// subharness v2 wave opens, and the types they hand over
// (docs/SUBHARNESS-PRD.md, docs/SUBHARNESS-CONTRACT.md). It is written by hand
// before the lanes start, in the shape standing_contract.go and
// standing_orders.go already proved.
//
// THE SIGNATURES ARE THE CONTRACT. The surface lanes code against them exactly
// as they stand and the bodies fill in underneath. A door with nothing behind it
// answers the way it does when this build has no subharnesses at all — nothing,
// calmly — so a page built against one draws nothing rather than an error.
//
// WHICH LANE FILLS WHICH is written on each door below. In short: the LIST and
// the INTAKE CARD are answered here already, out of the registry, because
// everything they need is a fact the registry holds and a second reading of it
// would be a second answer to "which subharnesses are there". LAUNCHING is the
// door lane's, because a run is a task node and this file may not decide what a
// task node is.

// store arrive here indistinguishable, which is the whole contract in one line:
// the person, the model and this list cannot tell which is which, because there

//
// THE GENERALIST IS NOT ON IT. `linear` is registered as a runner — the
// deoptimization path resolves it by name — but it is what you get when you pick
// nothing, not something you pick, and a list that offered it would be offering

// THE TUI LANE draws it; the LastRun note is read through the STORE LANE's seam
// ([Config.SubharnessLastRun]), which is filled from the run journals that lane

// A RUN IS A TASK NODE: a roster row, a room, a journal fed by the program's own

// DESIGNING a harness is a task and RUNNING one blocks the conversation as a
// turn (harness.go) — the thing a person most wants to walk away from is the
// one thing they cannot.
//
// THE TASK SURFACE IS A PRESENTATION OF A RUN AND NOT ITS DEFINITION. The

// system in the process at all, which is why the contract this door sits on
// ([exec.Runner]) knows nothing about tasks and this door knows everything.

// THE BODY IS subharness_run.go's, and this is the door onto it: the name is
