// ONE FAMILY-WIDE CHECK IS THE PARENT'S, AND IT IS RUN ONCE (#569).
//
// A division hands out parts that run at the same time, each in a worktree of
// its own. So a done-condition copied into every part is not one check — it is
// as many runs of that check as there are parts, all of them concurrent, none
// of them able to see what the others wrote, and then one more run by the parent
// after the parts are integrated. The measured shape is three parts each ordered
// to run `go test ./internal/tui3/...`, a suite that takes eight minutes on an
// idle box: four runs of it where the work needed one, three of them judging a
// tree that does not yet hold the other parts' files and so cannot be right
// about the family anyway.
//
// THE LAW THE DIVISION WANTED: A PART'S DONE-CONDITION IS SCOPED TO THE FILES
// THAT PART OWNS, AND A CHECK OVER THE WHOLE FAMILY RUNS ONCE, BY THE PARENT,
// AFTER INTEGRATION. That is the same sentence the scope rule already makes
// about paths (task_divide_scope.go) said about commands: what a part is
// finished against describes the part, not the family it belongs to.
//
// These cases drive the real divide door, exactly as the scope-admission cases
// beside them do (task_divide_test.go's newDivideNest / divideArgsFor), because
// the whole of the question is which child specs the door actually admits.

// the one literal would call `go test  ./internal/tui3/` a different check and
// pass a division that is still four runs of one suite. Whitespace is collapsed,
