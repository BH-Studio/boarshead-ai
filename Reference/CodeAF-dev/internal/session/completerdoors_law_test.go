// ── THE LAW: THE WRAPPER HIDES NO DOOR THE ADAPTER OFFERS ───────────────────
//
// [sessionCompleter] is the one thing every request an agent makes goes
// through, and it is a WRAPPER: [Agent.installSessionClient] writes it on every
// construction path, so `a.client` is never the adapter itself. Everything this
// package asks the adapter through an optional interface — `client.(modelChain)`,
// `client.(laneProber)` — is therefore asking the WRAPPER, and a door the
// wrapper does not forward is a door the conversation does not have, however
// completely the adapter implements it.
//
// THAT IS NOT A HYPOTHETICAL. `ProbeLanes` was swallowed exactly this way: the
// probe bought by a person starting to type — the one that exists so a turn's
// first token is not also paying for a TLS handshake — had never fired in a
// built agent, on any road, since the wrapper landed. It looked covered, because
// the test that covered it constructed `&Agent{client: adapter}` directly and so
// never met the wrapper at all. A green test over a door nobody could reach is
// the same shape internal/remote's surface-door law was written for, one layer
// down.
//
// So: every optional interface this package type-asserts on a completer, that
// the real adapter satisfies, must be forwarded by [sessionCompleter]. The
// comparison is by name and arity for internal/remote's stated reason — the same
// method is spelled `Answer` in one package and `session.Answer` in another —
// and a door that is absent or the wrong shape is what this catches.
