// Issue #890's engine half. The belt refuses a `propose_task` whose declared
// check is a composed shell command, and THE SENTENCE IT ANSWERS WITH IS
// WRITTEN FOR THE MODEL: it names `checks`, quotes the offending command, and
// is one repair away from a working call — which is the stated reason the door
// refuses rather than dropping silently. The surface may no longer draw that
// sentence to the person (tui3's refusal_test.go holds that half), but nothing
// about the refusal itself may soften: the model still reads it verbatim as
// the tool's result, in the transcript, because that is the only place the
// repair can happen.
