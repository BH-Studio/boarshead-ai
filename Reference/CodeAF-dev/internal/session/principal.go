package session

// THE PRINCIPAL: WHO THIS SESSION IS WORKING FOR.
//
// Every road out of a running turn eventually reaches the same sentence — "ask
// them what to do next" — and until this file there was no `them`. The
// harness said the words into whatever was there: a terminal with a person in
// front of it, or, on a run started with `--yolo` and left overnight, nobody at
// all. The two look identical from inside the engine, and that is exactly the
// bug. A note that reads "offer them a follow-up in their own words before
// anything else is spent" (task_run.go's [taskNote]) is a correct sentence to a
// person and a dead end to an empty room: the model answers it in words, the
// turn ends, and the session idles with the budget unspent.
//
// So the addressee is named, once, and every such road goes through it.
//
// ── THE EVIDENCE THAT WROTE THIS FILE ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// Three autonomous runs, same build, same shape of ending. One quit after two
// and a half hours holding a measured partial result with three quarters of its
// budget left. One quit at the same hour on a tree that did not compile. One
// quit after eighteen minutes with nothing built at all. None of the three hit
// a wall, ran out of money or was stopped: each reached a moment where the
// engine's answer was "ask the person", there was no person, and the run ended
// there. Two more were zeroed at the end by scratch files the session had left
// lying beside the deliverable — nothing in the engine ever looked back over
// what it had created.
//
// ── THE TWO PRINCIPALS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// [Person] is the interactive one and it is DELIBERATELY EMPTY. It answers
// every question the way the engine answered it before this file existed: it
// holds no acceptance (a person holds their own), it has no budget, it turns no
// landing into a brief, and it decides exactly what [Agent.readRemains]'s empty
// string already decided. That emptiness is the contract — an interactive
// session must not be able to tell that this interface arrived — and
// principal_person_test.go is the part a build fails on.
//
// [Steward] is the autonomous one. It is handed the goal, an acceptance written
// for the WHOLE ask rather than for one unit of work, and a budget; and it
// answers the questions a person would have answered, out of the evidence the
// session already has.
//
// ── WHY A BUDGET IS WHAT ARMS IT ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `--yolo` today says one thing: run tools without asking. It says nothing
// about how long, how much, or whether anybody is coming back — and a flag that
// silently started carrying a session on for hours because it also happened to
// mean "unattended" would be the harness deciding to spend somebody's money on
// a sentence they did not write. A BUDGET IS THE SENTENCE. It is a ceiling the
// person states in advance, it is the thing a Steward stops at, and without one
// `--yolo` is exactly what it has always been.

// Principal is the addressee of every "ask the person" path in this package.
//
// FIVE METHODS, AND EACH ONE IS A QUESTION THE ENGINE USED TO ANSWER FOR
// ITSELF. Ask and Acceptance are what the work is measured against; Budget is
// what may be spent measuring it; Report is one unit of work coming home, and
// what — if anything — to open next on the strength of it; Decide is the end of
// a turn that stopped.
//
// IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT A STRUCT OF CALLBACKS. Two implementations exist and
// the whole point of the interface is that a third — a person on another
// machine, a queue, a scheduled owner — can be written without any road in this
// package learning a new name.

	// finished, as one observable sentence. Empty means this principal holds
	// no acceptance of its own — which is a person, who is looking at the
	// work and does not need one written down.
	Acceptance() string

	// Budget is what may still be spent. The zero Budget is no ceiling at all,
	// which is what an attended session has always had.
	Budget() Budget

	// Report is told how one unit of work landed, and answers WHAT TO OPEN
	// NEXT — a brief, in the words the next attempt should start on. An empty

// ([Budget.Set]), which is the whole of how `--yolo` keeps its old behaviour.

//     silence — a run that spent its hours and said nothing is a run nobody can
//     learn from.
//  3. WHAT LANDED AND WHAT RAN COME BEFORE ANY READER'S LINE. This is the rung
//     that moved, and it is the whole of #468. A reader's line is a reading of the
//     TRANSCRIPT — what the session said about itself — while a settled landing

// THE FROZEN DONE-CONDITION IS NEVER EVIDENCE HERE. It is written before any work
