// wiring; this file is the reading side of it): the rows a surface draws for
// the plan this conversation seeded, and one task's page when a person opens
// it. Nothing here writes the store — the pulse, the CLI and the worker own
// every write — and nothing here runs a model, so a pane refresh costs a
// couple of reads and no calls.
//
// A ROW IS THE STORE'S READ, narrowed to the conversation. The plan store is
// read whole and filtered by the run's chat tag, so a store that holds another
// conversation's work answers only this one's; the surfaces that want the
// machine-wide picture read the store whole through the CLI, and this door is
// deliberately the narrower one.
