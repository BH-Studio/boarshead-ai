// The `stand` tool: how a sentence in a conversation becomes something that
// keeps working after the window is closed.
//
// A person says "remind me at six", "tell me when CI goes red", "every Monday
// draft the weekly update", "keep main green", "tonight run the full suite".
// Every one of those is an ordinary sentence and NONE of them is a command:
// there is no cron syntax to learn and no scheduler screen to open, so the
// whole recognition problem lands on the model, and this tool is the one verb
// it reaches for when it recognises one. docs/AMBIENT.md is the design; the
// object it makes is internal/standing's [standing.Item].
//
// ── THE LAWS THIS FILE APPLIES ──
//
//   - NOTHING STANDS UNTIL THE PERSON SAYS YES. The tool proposes; the card is
//     answered; only then is anything created. There is no argument, no phrasing
//     and no op that arms an item without a yes.
//
//   - NO CLOCK WHILE SOMEBODY IS THERE. The card is a thing a person reads:
//     their own sentence, when it would wake, what it would cost. Reading that
//     takes as long as it takes, and a card that ended itself halfway through
//     was a card the person watched expire rather than answered. So a WATCHED
//     session sends NO deadline at all (Notice.Deadline stays zero, and the
//     surface draws no meter for a zero) and the wait ends on exactly three
//     things: they answer, the turn is interrupted, or the session closes.
//
//   - AND SILENCE STILL ARMS NOTHING. This is where the standing card parts
//     company with propose_task's, whose silence is a yes (task.go). A task is
//     bounded work somebody is watching; a standing item spends money on its
//     own, forever, at times nobody chose. A turn that ended with the card
//     unanswered therefore leaves NOTHING behind, and the model is told exactly
//     that rather than a refusal nobody made.
//
//   - AN UNWATCHED SESSION CANNOT RATIFY ONE AT ALL. A --once run, a task node,
//     a firing's own headless session: none of them has anybody to answer, and a
//     card drawn into an empty room would be a card only a clock could ever
//     answer. So the tool refuses in plain words rather than proposing there.
//     (The door does not even fill Config.Standing for those, so in practice the
//     tool is absent — this is the belt-and-braces half of the same law.)
//
//   - THE OFFER TO KEEP CHECKING WITH NO WINDOW OPEN IS MADE ONCE, EVER, and
//     the yes is journaled BEFORE the host is touched. A marker file under the
//     store root is the whole memory of it: asked, what they said, when. An
//     install that half-worked must never be an install nobody remembers asking
//     about.
//
// The tool is ABSENT when Config.Standing is nil (tools.go), which is the
// absence law this codebase is built on: a verb with nothing behind it is worse
// than no verb, because a model told it can set up a reminder will plan a whole
// reply around one.

// standDescription is what the model reads before it calls, and most of it is

// AND RECOGNITION IS A TEST, NOT A WORD LIST. This description used to hand the
// model a bag of trigger words — "whenever", "every", "from now on", "make sure"
// — and a bag of words is a matcher a model runs instead of thinking: it caught
// "make sure this website you're building is 3 pages" and proposed a standing
// order for an acceptance criterion, which is the worst failure this tool has,
// because a card the person did not want teaches them to distrust every card
// after it. So what it carries now is the reasoning — the discharge test, what
// anchors a sentence to today's work, what separates a waking kind from a hold,
// and what to do when the answer is genuinely unclear — with a handful of
// canonical examples to calibrate it and nothing to pattern-match on.
//
// AND IT IS WRITTEN FOR DENSITY, BECAUSE THIS STRING IS BILLED ON EVERY REQUEST
// OF EVERY TURN. The belt's schemas ride in front of each request the model
// makes — dozens of them in one task — so a paragraph here is paid dozens of
// times while this comment is free. So the reasoning stays and the repetition
// went: the last paragraph used to walk every argument a second time, and every
// one of those sentences is now said ONCE, in the schema field it governs.
var standDescription = "Set up something that keeps working after this window is closed — a reminder, a watch on the world, a rule, or work that runs overnight — and manage the ones that already stand. THE PERSON NEVER NAMES THIS TOOL; you recognise it from what their sentence IS.\n\n" +
	"THE DISCHARGE TEST decides it. Can this sentence be satisfied once and then forgotten? If it CAN, it is part of the work in front of you — an acceptance criterion, an instruction — and it does NOT stand, whatever words it is dressed in and even when it says \"make sure\": \"make sure this website you are building is 3 pages\" is discharged the moment the site has three pages. If it can NEVER be discharged — if work nobody has done yet could violate it tomorrow — it is standing: \"make sure the tests never break\".\n\n" +
	"ANCHORING. A sentence about the artifact under construction RIGHT NOW binds the current work, whatever verbs it uses, and what anchors it is the GRAMMAR: a demonstrative pointing at the thing in front of you (\"this website you're building\"), or a present tense about work already under way (\"what you're doing\"). An \"always\", a \"never\" or an \"ensure\" inside such a sentence is EMPHASIS ON THIS WORK — a quality bar for the thing being built is acceptance, and acceptance is never a card.\n\n" +
	"WAKING OR HOLDING. A standing sentence that names a moment, a rhythm or a condition gets the waking kind it names (\"remind me at 6\" is at, \"every Monday draft the update\" is every, \"tell me when CI goes red\" is probe, \"tonight run the suite\" is idle). One that names none of them — a rule, a convention, a preference — is when.kind hold.\n\n" +
	"UNSURE MEANS INSTRUCTION PLUS AN OFFER. When the discharge test is genuinely unclear, bind the sentence to the work in front of you AND offer the standing version in one line of prose at the end of your reply. NEVER a card on a guess: a card they did not want costs their trust in every card after it.\n\n" +
	"Doing a standing sentence once instead of proposing it answers a request they did not make: \"run the tests\" is work you do now, \"run the tests whenever I push\" is one of these. The `watch` tool is the near neighbour that is NOT this: a watch is a job inside this conversation and stops the moment the window closes, so anything that has to keep looking after they walk away belongs here and never there.\n\n" +
