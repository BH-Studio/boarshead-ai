// A HARNESS BEING DESIGNED IS A TASK, AND A TASK IS A PLACE.
//
// harness_build.go is the design itself — the meta-guide, the review pass, the
// validator, the card nobody may skip — and none of that changed. What changed
// is where it happens. A design used to be a goroutine with a note in front of
// it: one dim line said a harness was being written, a minute or two passed
// with nothing on screen, and a card arrived. From the outside that is
// indistinguishable from a program that did nothing, and there was nothing to
// walk into, nothing to say to it, and no number to refer to it by afterwards.
//
// So a design is admitted to the WORK GRAPH (task_run.go) as a node of its own.
// It costs nothing to say and it buys everything the tasker already has:
//
//	a row on the roster        with a live phase and an id a person can say
//	a room                     enter it, watch the page being written, esc out
//	a journal                  the design thread, on disk, permanently
//	a stop                     the same ✕ and the same `Cancel("task:4")`
//	a settle card              naming the harness and the version it saved as
//
// ── IT IS ADMITTED, NOT PROPOSED ──
//
// [Agent.proposeTask] asks the person before the work starts, on a countdown.
// This does not, and the reason is that THE QUESTION ALREADY EXISTS one step
// later: nothing is written to the registry until somebody answers the design
// card, which is the whole bargain harness_build.go makes. A countdown in front
// of it would be two questions about one decision — "may I write a page?" and
// then "may I keep the page?" — and the first of those is a question about
// spending a minute, which is what the ✕ on the row is for.
//
// ── THE PHASES ARE THE POINT OF THE ROW ──
//
// A node of this kind moves through three named moments and says so on the wire
// ([TaskNotice.Doing]): it is DESIGNING while the page is being written, it is
// AWAITING YOUR LOOK while the card is up, and then it lands — saved, declined,
// or failed with the reason. The state under all of that is plain `running`
// until it settles, because it is running; the phase is the same fact in the
// vocabulary of the work rather than of the graph.
//
// ── AND THE ROOM IS A CONVERSATION, WHICH IS WHY IT HAS AN AGENT ──
//
// An ordinary node's room holds the worker, and the person's words reach it
// because it is always mid-turn. A design has no worker — it is two model calls
// and a wait — so the room would have been empty and steering it would have
// been refused. What stands in it instead is a THREAD AGENT: a child session
// whose transcript is the design's own story (the brief, the page it wrote,
// what became of it), whose journal is the permanent record of it, and which
// wakes to answer anything the person says into the room (Config.roomThread).
// The page is in its context, so "why did it choose two steps?" and "would this
// work for the nightly build?" are questions it can actually answer.
//
// AND THE JOURNAL HOLDS MORE THAN THAT TRANSCRIPT DOES, which is the one place
// the two part company. What the designer THINKS goes into the room as it
// streams, and what each stage REACHED is journaled as it finishes
// ([designSeat.noted]) — the draft with its card, an attempt the law turned
// down, what the review made of the page — so the room reads back tomorrow as
// the story it was, while none of it is put in front of the thread, because a
// draft that was replaced is a wrong answer waiting to be given
// ([Agent.journalOnly]).
//
// WHAT NEVER CROSSES IS THE REPLY ITSELF. The designer answers with one enormous
// JSON envelope, and a room that typed that envelope into itself at reading
// speed buried the very thing somebody walked in to watch. The page being typed
// is accounted for by the replacing progress row instead (harness_build.go's
// harnessProgress), which reads the same stream and says "naming it: X", "4
// steps so far", "receiving · 12.3 KB".
//
// AND THE THING THE MODEL NEEDS THAT NOBODY WANTS TO READ GOES IN SYSTEM-ROLE.
// The thread agent has to reason off the PAGE — the real one, with its node ids
// and fields — while the person in the same room wants the card and nothing but.
// Both live in one transcript, so the split is the role: the surfaces skip system
// messages when they draw a transcript, and the transport takes them anywhere in
// the array ([harnessThreadBrief] states the whole mechanism, and
// [harnessPageContext] is what rides on it).
//
// AND THE THREAD CAN CHANGE THE PAGE, WHICH IS WHY THE ROOM IS WORTH STANDING
// IN. It used to be able only to talk about one: asked to "change it to also run
// the linter" it said, correctly and uselessly, that a revision was a new design
// and pointed at the door. A person looking at a draft, in the draft's own room,
// told to leave and start over — and the key on the card that offered to help
// silently dropped the page first.
//
// It has one verb for that now (tools_harness.go's revise_design), and the verb
// hands the person's own words to the design loop parked on the card
// ([TaskNode.reviseDoor]). The card comes down, the designer writes the page
// again with the change in it, the same milestones are journaled for the rework,
// and a new card goes up. It goes round as many times as it takes.
//
// WHAT IT STILL CANNOT DO IS SAVE. Nothing in this thread reaches the registry:
// only the person's approval of a card does, and that has not moved. Which is
// also why the card is no longer the only door — the room draws an approval row
// of its own while one is waiting (internal/tui3's roomapproval.go), so the
// three things a person can do about a page can all be done where they are
// standing.

// may not do.
//
// IT USED TO BEGIN BY REFUSING. The brief said a revision was a new design and
// told the thread to say so — which was true of the machinery and useless to the
// person, because they were standing in the design's own room, looking at the
// page, saying the one thing anybody ever says about a draft. The room is where
// a page is worked on now (revise_design), so the brief that denied it is gone
// and this one is written for a collaborator.
//
// WHAT IT STILL REFUSES IS THE SAVE, and that has not moved an inch: nothing in
// this thread writes to the registry, and the card is the person's to answer.
