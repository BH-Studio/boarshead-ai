// A team's name, suggested once.

// A person grouping conversations on the conversations view is offered a name
// for the group before they type one. When the conversations share a project
// folder the surface offers the folder's name and never asks; otherwise it asks
// here, once, over the conversations' own titles, and a person who has started
// typing has already answered.
//
// IT IS THE CONVERSATION NAMER'S ERRAND WITH A SMALLER QUESTION. It goes through
// the same door ([Agent.callRoleChecked]) on the same role ([roles.RoleTitle]),
// so it lands on the cheap tier a person has configured for names and is billed
// the same way: against the model that answered, off every turn's clock. It is
// one ask with no ladder of retries of its own, because the caller holds a word
// already and a slow answer is simply not used.

// teamNameAsk is the instruction, last in the user message for the reason
// titleSystem's comment gives.
