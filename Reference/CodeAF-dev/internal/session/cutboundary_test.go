// A SPLIT DRAWING REACHES THE BOUNDARY ITS OWN CUT OPENED (#956).
//
// A mark's drawing rides beside the next step and its one power over the work is
// the interruption: cut the request in flight so that the boundary where the
// drawing can be SPENT arrives at once rather than whenever the step happens to
// end (checkpoint.go's [markAside], sidecar.go). Two orderings took that promise
// away, and both ended the same way — the turn paid for a whole extra step, and
// where that step was its last the drawing was written down as a carry-on and
// nothing was handed anywhere:
//
//   - the answer was published only once the interruption had been DELIVERED, so
//     the boundary the cut bought could read the reading as still in flight;
//   - a cut that arrived between two steps found nothing to cut and was dropped,
//     though a drawing rides no transcript and has nowhere else to be spent.
//
// The tests below are the two orderings, both directions of the claim that keeps
// an interruption and a taker from both happening, the properties that keep an
// owed cut from reaching anybody else's turn or outliving the boundary it was
// owed for, and the journal row on the one road where a drawing genuinely can
// land too late.

// THE FIRST ORDERING, at the mechanism. A reading whose interruption has been
