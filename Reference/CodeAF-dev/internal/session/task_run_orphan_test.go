// A RUN NO PROCESS HOLDS IS A RECORD, NEVER MORE WORK.
//
// On 2026-09-24 a CSSTree `/senior-dev` ran inside the store an earlier
// happy-dom run had left open when codeaf went away under it: the program was
// handed happy-dom's brief in the CSSTree copy, its calls, spend, ceiling and
// ending were written into happy-dom's record folder, and the CSSTree task had
// no page. These tests pin the three doors that close that: the conversation
// closing under a program's run ends it before anything is cut, a new hand-off
// archives whatever store it finds and seeds its own, and a conversation read
// back from disk ends a program's run the last process left open — each at the
// run's last evidence of life, never at the moment somebody noticed.
