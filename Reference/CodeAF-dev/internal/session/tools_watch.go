// The watch tool: the harness polls so the context does not.
//
// Watching a log today costs a turn per look. The model runs `tail -50 app.log`,
// reads fifty lines, waits, runs it again, reads forty-eight of the SAME fifty
// lines, and the transcript fills with near-identical chunks whose information
// content is two lines. Background jobs do not fix this — a job reports once,
// when it exits, and a log file never exits. Polling is the missing primitive's
// shadow: the model keeps asking because nothing can tell it.
//
// So the harness runs the command on a timer and speaks only when there is news.
// Three ideas hold the whole thing up:
//
//   - A WATCH IS A JOB. It gets an id from the same registry, a log file in the
//     same directory, a row in the same list, and it dies to the same kill and
//     the same Close (jobs.go). What differs from a background process is only
//     what happens in the middle — a timer instead of a wait — which is why it
//     is a jobKind and a stop function rather than a second machine with its own
//     vocabulary for "running".
//
//   - THE NOTE IS THE DELTA, NOT THE OUTPUT. Every mode answers the same
//     question — what is NEW — and answers it in at most forty lines. on=change
//     diffs against the previous tick and says only what appeared; on=match says
//     only the new lines the pattern picked; on=always is the deliberate
//     exception, for a number that is supposed to be watched climbing. The first
//     tick of a change or match watch is SILENT: it is the baseline, and a
//     baseline delivered as news would be exactly the fifty-line chunk this tool
//     exists to stop sending.
//
//   - A TICK RIDES THE AMBIENT LANE AND THE FIRING DOES NOT. The full tick is
//     kept in the job log, while a compact update waits in agent.go until the
//     turn boundary. Several ticks become one count plus the newest fact. No
//     push and no new surface event: the job row and log remain live, while the
//     model is protected from a synthetic user message in the middle of
//     unrelated work.
//
//     A TICK DOES NOT WAKE AN IDLE SESSION. A delta is periodic telemetry rather
//     than a new question, and waking once per delta turns a quiet observer into
//     an autonomous conversation. Its accumulated result is waiting in the
//     next turn's opening batch, and `jobs output` holds every tick if the model
//     needs the detail.
//
//     THE FIRING WAKES IT, and it is the opposite case wearing the same clothes.
//     When `until` matches, the output goes quiet, or the command fails its way
//     out, the watch has ANSWERED THE QUESTION IT WAS STARTED FOR and will never
//     say anything again. Held for a turn boundary, that answer sits until the
//     person happens to type — measured: a session watching `gh pr checks` learned
//     the checks had settled and said nothing about it. So the firing is queued as
//     an OWED note that starts a turn by itself, exactly as a background job's
//     exit is ([runWatch], agent.go's [Agent.enqueueWatchNote]).
//
// Two governors, because a timer that never stops is a way to burn a session
// down. THREE WATCHES AT A TIME, so a model that discovers the tool cannot turn
// the transcript into a ticker tape. And THREE CONSECUTIVE FAILED TICKS WITH THE
// SAME ERROR ends the watch with one note — a watch spinning on a command that
// cannot run is the loop detector's cousin (looped.go), and the honest response
// to a repetition that carries no information is to say so once and stop.

// again: ANYTHING HANDED OFF REPORTS ITSELF. Four tools each paying for the same
// sentence on every request of every turn is four bills for one rule, so it is
// stated once on the page (prompts/system.md) and nowhere on the belt. What
// stays here is the contract: the timer, the batching, the ceiling, and the
