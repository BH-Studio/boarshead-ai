// A TURN READS, A TASK WRITES — WITH A SMALL ALLOWANCE IN FRONT OF IT.
//
// ── THE RUN THIS WAS WRITTEN FROM ──
//
// A person typed "implement this issue" and it ran as a PLAIN CHAT TURN for
// seven minutes and forty-six seconds: forty-eight tool calls, `sed -i` edits in
// their live checkout, nobody watching, nothing to open. What finally moved it
// was the checkpoint ceiling at forty finished rounds — a governor sized for a
// READING grind, which counts rounds and knows nothing about what those rounds
// did to the disk. Nothing before it was a seam at all: the pre-turn route judge
// was deliberately demoted to triage, and the post-turn judge excuses any turn
// that used tools.
//
// ── THE RULING (owner, 2026-09-01, issue #272) ──
//
// A turn may make A SMALL BOUNDED EDIT INLINE — of the order of
// [writeAllowanceCalls] write calls — and then the next workspace write promotes
// it to a task through the road the ceiling already takes. READS STAY FREE, in
// any number: a turn that spends forty rounds looking at a repository has cost
// the person a wait and nothing else, and the checkpoint's own argument that
// slow-to-interrupt is the honest direction holds
// for exactly that turn. It fails for a writing one, because what is at stake
// there is not the wait — it is unreviewed edits in a directory somebody is
// standing in.
//
// ── WHY IT COUNTS CALLS AND NOT FILES ──
//
// The allowance was once TWO COUNTS, and the second of them was how many DISTINCT
// files under the workspace the turn had touched. Two files is not a grind; it is
// the commonest shape of one small finished piece of work. A turn that writes a
// script and then the output the script produces has touched two files and done
// ONE thing, and it was moved onto a task for the breadth alone — a fresh worktree,
// a brief, and a person waiting on a handover for what was already finishing in
// front of them. Breadth is not the harm the ruling names: HOW OFTEN A TURN
// REACHES FOR THE DISK is, because that is what the measured run was made of and
// that is what nobody is watching. So there is one count, and it is the calls.
//
// ── WHY THE COUNTER IS ITS OWN THING AND NOT ANOTHER MARK ──
//
// The checkpoint meter prices READING: [checkpointPrice] and its doublings are
// rounds of a turn, and the ceiling is where the harness stops paying to look.
// Writes are a different unit and a different question, so this is a counter of
// its own with its own allowance, and it opens THE SAME DOOR — a counter that
// grew a second way to start a task would be two roads into the graph, which is
// the thing checkpoint.go exists to have exactly one of.
//
// ── AND IT IS A DOOR, NOT A CAGE ──
//
// The seam fires ONCE in a turn. Past it the ceiling is the governor again, as
// it always was. That is not a softness: the handover it opens is the ordinary
// one, which can be DECLINED when the running model and the mark's own reader
// both say nothing remains ([Agent.handOverRunningTurn]) — and a turn that made
// its handful of edits and finished is exactly that turn. A seam that re-fired
// every round would ask the reader and the model the same question over and over
// and charge the person for each of them.

// finishing. It is the count that catches the shape the ruling was written from —

// ── delivery: the one turn this counter does not move ───────────────────────
//
// THE LAW: A RESULT THIS CONVERSATION ALREADY OWNS IS DELIVERED BY THIS
// CONVERSATION. The seam does not hand the delivery of an owned result to a
// second task.
//
// ── THE MEASURED FAILURE (the four-module trial, 2026-09-06) ──
//
// A person asked for a four-module repair delivered on a branch, with a final
// commit. Task 1 did the repair and landed: 29 independent checks passed, the
// protected files were untouched, the branch existed. Its report woke this
// conversation, and the turn that read it did what the request still owed —
// cherry-picked the work across and staged it. That is a run of writes under the
// workspace, so THIS COUNTER FIRED, and the delivery was handed to a second
// task in a FRESH WORKTREE: a working copy with none of the staged index, none
// of the cherry-pick, and a brief written from a turn that was integrating
// rather than working. It ended in a cancelled stream. The requested commit
// never happened, on work that was finished and correct.
//
// ── WHY THIS IS THE SEAM'S OWN LAW AND NOT ANOTHER EXCEPTION ──
//
// The seam's premise is stated at the top of this file: what is at stake is
// unreviewed edits in a directory somebody is standing in, WITH NOTHING TO OPEN
// AND NOBODY WATCHING. Neither half is true of a delivery. The work was watched
// — it ran as a task, it was audited, it reported — and there is something to
// open, which is the task whose result is being delivered. What the promotion
// buys there is not supervision; it is a second worktree that cannot see the
// first one's index, which is the failure above.
//
// checkpoint_custody.go states the neighbouring half of the same law for work
// this conversation is STILL HOLDING ("work this conversation is still holding
// never leaves it"), and it reads only UNSETTLED pieces, deliberately: a piece
// that has reported is a fact rather than a wait. This is what the same custody
// means once the piece has come back — the delivery of a settled result is the
// conversation's own, for the same reason the coordination of an unsettled one
// is.
//
// ── AND WHAT IT DOES NOT TOUCH ──
//
//   - THE ROUND CEILING AND THE WALL STILL GOVERN THIS TURN, both of them, on
//     the same ladder as any other woken turn. That reversal was measured
//     (checkpoint.go: a wake that ran 127 calls over 46 minutes ungoverned) and
//     nothing here gives it back. What stands down is THIS COUNTER alone, because
//     a run of writes is the expected shape of an integration and is evidence of
//     nothing there.
//   - A PERSON'S OWN NEW SENTENCE CLOSES IT IMMEDIATELY. A turn that owes
//     anything the person typed — a new request, a correction steered into this
//     one — is not a delivery, and the seam protects it exactly as it did.
//   - THE DOOR IS NOT SPENT, ONLY HELD. The counter keeps counting, so the
//     sentence they type next is met with the allowance already crossed and the
//     seam free to fire.
//   - AND OWNERSHIP MUST BE PROVABLE FROM THE GRAPH. Where it cannot be — a node
//     restored from a checkpoint has no admitter and no owner, both died with
//     the process — the seam fires as it always did. A doubt is not a delivery.

// deliveringOwnedResult reports whether this turn is delivering results this
// conversation owns, and names one of them for the journal.
//
// EVERY PART OF IT IS A RUNTIME FACT and none of it is a reading of anybody's
// words: which results arrived in this turn ([Agent.rememberOwedLocked] stamps
// them from the reply tags the delivery itself carries), whether the person has
