// A RUN'S LIFE, FROM THE REQUEST THAT OPENS IT TO THE LAST WORD ON ITS RECORD.
//
// Each test here is one defect a reviewer measured on the bash belt's run door,
// held at the door a person reaches it through: a new hand-off adopting a run it
// did not start, an ending that wrote nothing on the run's own task, a hand-off
// joining a run already on its way out, a closed conversation landing work and
// failing its row, a steer taken on a run that had ended, a stop that read as a
// failure, and an interrupted row asking a question nothing could answer.
//
// The engine is a double, for the reason task_run_belt_test.go gives: the real
// one is built on this package and cannot be imported here. Every double in this
// file ends only when the test says so, so no assertion races a run.
