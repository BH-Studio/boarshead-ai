// WHAT A DESIGN IS HELD TO, AND WHAT IT COSTS TO GET IT WRONG.
//
// harness_build_test.go has the job and the card. This file has the ladder
// underneath them — salvage, the repair turn, the retry that hands a refused
// design its own error back, and the two ways an attempt can be spent for
// nothing. Every case here was a real failure first: a design that kept failing
// on a slow reasoning model, chased down to a reply that ran out of budget, a
// review thrown away by its own draft's homework, and a guide that told the
// designer there was no filesystem while handing it seven filesystem tools.
