// The durable frontier: the graph as a checkpoint, and recovery as a pure
// function of it.
//
// Until this file the task graph lived in one place — memory. Kill the app
// while a node is grinding on a build and everything about that work vanished
// with the process: which nodes were admitted, what they were briefed with,
// which of them had already landed and what their reports said, and — worst —
// the fact that a branch called task/fix-the-reconciler-9c1a2f is sitting in the
// repository with somebody's half-finished work on it and nothing left alive
// that knows why. The worktree survived; the knowledge of it did not.
//
// The research names the contract exactly (harness-research-notes.md §7, Resume
// semantics, arXiv:2608.03836): SCHEMA-VALID CHECKPOINTS, CONSUME-ONCE
// INTERRUPTS, RECOVERY AS A PURE FUNCTION OF DURABLE STATE. They machine-checked
// real frameworks against it and found violations, which is a good reason to
// write the three rules down rather than to assume them:
//
//   - THE CHECKPOINT IS WRITTEN AFTER EVERY TRANSITION, not at exit. A process
//     that is killed does not get to run its shutdown path, so a checkpoint that
//     is only correct at exit is a checkpoint that is only correct when nothing
//     went wrong. Admitted, running, the working copy prepared, the verdict in,
//     merged or conflicted or failed: each of those is a `g.checkpoint()` on the
//     way out of the transition, atomically (tmp + rename), so the file on disk
//     is always a whole graph somebody wrote and never half of two.
//
//   - LOADING IS SCHEMA-VALIDATED, AND A VIOLATION DROPS THE FILE WHOLE. This is
//     state.go's law and it is here for state.go's reason: refusing to start a
//     session because a bookkeeping file has a bad byte costs the person their
//     whole conversation, while starting with no graph costs them a summary they
//     can rebuild by working. One log line naming the path, and never fatal.
//
//   - AN INTERRUPT IS CONSUMED BY EXACTLY ONE RECOVERY. A node that was RUNNING
//     when the process died is interrupted work: nobody will ever finish it,
//     nobody will audit it, and its branch is on disk. Recovery turns it into a
//     failed node whose report says so and names the branch — and it RECORDS in
//     the checkpoint that it did (Interrupted), so the next resume reads plain
//     history rather than interrupting the same node a second time. The state
//     rewrite alone already makes it unrepeatable; the flag is the checkpoint
//     admitting to the consumption, which is the half of the contract a reader
//     can check.
//
// ── RECOVERY IS LOAD, RECONCILE, CONTINUE ──
//
// [Agent.recoverTasks] is three lines of work and no cleverness. LOAD the
// checkpoint. RECONCILE it with the disk — a node that was running is failed
// with its branch named, done and failed nodes come back as history with their
// leavings intact, queued nodes come back queued. CONTINUE by turning the same
// frontier every other transition turns: a queued node whose prerequisites are
// (still) done starts now, a queued node whose prerequisite was interrupted
// fails through the cascade that already exists. There is no resume path
// separate from the ordinary scheduler, because a second scheduler is a second
// set of rules to disagree with the first.
//
// ── A COMPLETION IS ANNOUNCED EXACTLY ONCE, ACROSS LIVES ──
//
// A done node must not re-notify on resume: its note is already in the
// transcript the journal replays, and hearing "task 1 finished" again would tell
// the model that work it has already read about has just happened. So the
// checkpoint records whether a node's completion note was ever handed to the
// steering lane (Noted), and recovery delivers a note ONLY for the nodes that
// never got one — the interrupted node, and the rare node that landed in the
// instant between its completion and the process dying. Those arrive inside the
// single recovery note, in the shape [taskNote] would have produced, so the
// model reads one grammar for one kind of news.
