// THE PERSON'S OWN WORDS REACH THE MODEL. Every door onto a turn is checked
// here, and the check is always the same one: the sentence somebody typed is in
// the request the provider was actually sent, carried by a user-role message.
//
// It is written as a family because of the shape of the defect it guards. A
// session that loses the sentence loses it BETWEEN two places that both look
// right on their own — the journal, which is written from the same value, and
// the transcript the model reads — so a test that asserted the journal, or
// asserted a.messages, would have passed while a person watched the model
// answer a question nobody asked. The only assertion worth making is the one
// made against the request that left.
//
// The last case runs over the real adapter, so the assertion is made on the
// bytes rather than on the []ai.Message the loop handed over: the seam between
// those two is a place a message has been reshaped before (internal/provider's
// sanitizeMessages, the cache breakpoints in caching.go), and a scripted
// completer cannot see it.

// personWords is the sentence every case in this file sends. It is deliberately
// a real question with real punctuation and a real misspelling, because the
// defect this file exists for was reported against exactly such a sentence.
