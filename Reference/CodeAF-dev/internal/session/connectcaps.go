// WHAT AN ACCOUNT MAY BE USED FOR, at the two moments a conversation touches it.
//
// internal/connect owns the model and the memory: a handful of sentences per
// service — "read your mail", "send mail as you" — each carrying yes, ask or off,
// and a file with only what somebody actually said in it. This file is the other
// half, the half that wave left to the wiring: the two places those answers have
// to bite, and the one place they are written from a conversation.
//
//   - ARMING. A capability that is off takes its tools OFF THE BELT, and the
//     account's line in `services` stops advertising it. Off is not a refusal at
//     the gate: a refused call costs a turn, teaches the model to try again in
//     different words, and puts a question in front of somebody who already
//     answered it. What is off is a thing the conversation never learns exists.
//   - JUDGING. The gate reads the state again at the moment of the call, so a
//     word changed in the settings sheet while a conversation is open takes
//     effect on the next call and not on the next process. Settings and chat
//     share one process and the store's lock is on the FILE, so that reading
//     costs a file read and nothing else.
//
// ── THE STATE IS READ FRESH, ALWAYS ──
//
// Nothing here caches an answer for the life of a turn, a belt or a session. The
// whole point of the panel is that a person changes their mind in it; a session
// that had read the answers once at arming would go on sending mail for an hour
// after they turned that off, which is the one failure this feature exists to
// prevent.
//
// ── ONE TOOL, TWO CAPABILITIES ──
//
// The hand-written families are one tool, one sentence: gmail_send is "send mail
// as you" and nothing else. A key account is different — it brings ONE tool that
// makes every call, so what it is doing is in the verb rather than in the name.
// A GET reads; every other verb writes at the far end in the person's name. So
// the capability that governs such a call is chosen by the verb here, using the
// same reading internal/approval already takes for its own floor
// ([approval.ActsInThePersonsName]), which is what keeps the panel's word and
// the gate's floor from ever disagreeing about what a POST is.
