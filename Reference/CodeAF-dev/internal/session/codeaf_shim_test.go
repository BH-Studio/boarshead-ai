// A WORKER'S `codeaf` IS THE CODEAF THAT IS RUNNING. The bash worker is taught
// to edit with `codeaf patch` (prompts/bashworker.md), and the only PATH entry
// the harness gave it was the run's `plandb` shim — so on any install whose
// file is not named codeaf (devaf, stageaf, a `--name` word) the call resolved
// on the machine's own PATH: `command not found` on a clean machine, and on the
// fresh-install check of 2026-09-25 an OLDER codeaf that answered `error: there
// is no \`codeaf patch\`` three times. These tests stand a stale `codeaf` that
// prints WRONG first on the process PATH and drive the real harness PATH setup
// ([NewBeltWorker], the run engine's worker seat, through the belt's own bash).
