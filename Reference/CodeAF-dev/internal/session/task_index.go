package session

// THE TASK INDEX: WHAT THIS PROJECT'S WORK WAS, AFTER THE CONVERSATION THAT
// ASKED FOR IT IS GONE.
//
// task_store.go keeps ONE conversation's graph, beside that conversation's
// journal, and it is right to: a graph is a live thing with a frontier and a
// scheduler, and it belongs to the session that turns it. This file keeps the
// other half — the compact record of every task family and landed node this
// PROJECT has ever run, in one append-only file the whole directory shares.
//
// The two are not the same fact and neither can stand in for the other. Ask
// "what is running" and the answer is the graph. Ask "what did we do about the
// nil-map crash last Tuesday" and the graph cannot answer at all: it died with
// the window. That question is the whole reason this file exists, and it is
// asked by two people —
//
//   - THE PERSON, by typing "@" (internal/tui3's task mentions). They half
//     remember a title, they want the row, and what they get back is a pointer
//     into the prompt rather than the work itself.
//   - THE MODEL, by calling the `tasks` tool (tools_tasks.go), when the person
//     referred to earlier work and pointed at nothing.
//
// Both read the same rows through the same search, because a person and a model
// disagreeing about which task "the reconciler one" was is the defect the index
// exists to prevent.
//
// ── THREE RULES ──
//
//   - JSONL, APPEND-ONLY, ONE ROW PER RUN ROOT AND LANDED NODE. Not a JSON
//     document like the checkpoint: the checkpoint is rewritten whole after
//     every transition and is one conversation's, while this is written once
//     per indexed row, forever, by every window open on the directory. An
//     append is the one write two processes can make to the same file without
//     a coordinator.
//   - A BAD LINE IS SKIPPED, NEVER FATAL. Two processes appending can, in the
//     limit, interleave a large row; a half-written line then costs exactly one
//     task's row. Refusing to complete an "@" because of it would cost the
//     feature.
//   - IT IS AN INDEX, NOT AN ARCHIVE. Every row is small and carries URIs
//     rather than content: the transcript is a file on disk, the artifact is a
//     worktree or a branch, and both are things the model already has hands to
//     read. A row that inlined an outcome in full would be this build's own
//     16KB-transport defect, one layer down.
//
// ── WHERE IT LIVES ──
//
// In the PROJECT BUCKET — ~/.codeaf/v3/projects/<workspace>/ — which is the
// directory holding this workspace's session folders (place.go, Decision 26).
// The scope is the project and not the conversation: every window open on the
// repository appends to one file, which is what makes "what work has this
// project had done" a question with one answer.
//
// The path is DERIVED rather than resolved a second way, exactly as
// [taskCheckpointPath] is: from the session's [Place] when it has one — the
// parent of the folder is the bucket — and from the session file's own
// directory for the legacy flat layout, where the workspace directory WAS the
// project scope. Deriving it from the workspace instead would be a second
// definition of "this project" to disagree with the first.
