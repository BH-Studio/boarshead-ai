// A RUN SETTLED AFTER ITS PROCESS WENT AWAY SAYS WHAT ENDED IT AND WHEN.
//
// The reopen road ([Agent.settleInterruptedProgramRow]) and the close road
// ([Agent.cutBeltRun]) each write a program's run's ending without the run
// there to say how it ended, and the project's index closes every run row its
// last process left running ([Agent.closeInflightTaskIndexRows]). These tests
// pin that each of them tells the truth the run left behind: a person's stop
// is a stop, a limit is the limit, a program that had already exited is not
// said to have been running, and every ending is dated by the run's own facts
// rather than by the moment somebody noticed.
