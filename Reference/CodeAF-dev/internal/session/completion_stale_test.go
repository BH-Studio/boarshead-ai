// WHO OWNS THE DECISION THAT A REQUEST IS FINISHED (calibration handoff-before
// cell 004-revision-midwork-codeaf, and handoff-after cell 001 after it).
//
// Both cells are the same conversation: a person asked for a one-minute command
// AND a report, changed the report from Markdown to CSV while the command ran,
// and the model wrote `report.csv`, removed `report.md` and finished. Both cells
// then made a task out of it and both hit the 180-second cap.
//
// The two traces failed through the SAME line for two different reasons, which
// is what these cases pin. In 004 (`transcript.jsonl` lines 33-44) the mark's
// reader drew `B` — one part, no division — the continuation answered
// `NOTHING LEFT TO DO` (`carry rung:draft outcome:nothing-left`), and the drop
// was refused because the drawing was not the word `(done)`; the ceiling wrote
// `seam:write decision:moved carry:ask` and a cold worker was started on the
// person's ORIGINAL sentence, CSV and all. In 001 the reader could not be
// reached at all (`role:markreader message:context canceled`) and the identical
// refusal followed from a reading that never happened.
//
// So the law these cases hold: a drawing REFUSES a completion claim only when it
// says work remains, never merely by failing to agree — and the claim is bounded
// by the turn's own budget rather than by a second reader.
