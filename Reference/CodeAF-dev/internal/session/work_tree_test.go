// THE WORK TREE, AS TESTS: what "working right now" answers, and what it must
// never answer.
//
// Two surfaces read this door and nothing else, so the thing worth pinning is
// not the shape of the struct — that is the contract, and it is frozen — but
// the three claims a reader is entitled to make about what comes out of it:
// every row is a worker that exists, a row's state is what that worker is
// actually doing, and an idle session answers nothing at all.
