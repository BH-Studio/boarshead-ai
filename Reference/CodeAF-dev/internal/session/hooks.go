package session

// The control plane: the four moments in a turn where the harness — rather than
// the model — gets a say, each one named.
//
// The seam began as names around existing behavior. The turn-output fold is the
// first new context citizen to use it: its end-of-turn pass shares this chain,
// while its per-step pass is called alone because the older cross-turn stub must
// remain an end-of-turn operation (loop.go). Every guardrail, recovery move and
// context trick this harness grows next otherwise lands as another line in the
// turn with its own ordering argument, testable only through a whole turn.
//
// ── THE FOUR, IN HARNESS-R1'S OWN WORDS ──
//
// (https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.02276 §"lifecycle hooks", the edit surface an
// automated harness-engineer emits patches against; the one-liners below are
// theirs, and each interface's doc comment repeats the one it implements.)
//
//	1. episode-init   — set starting context/state
//	2. pre-decision   — augment context with retrieved guidance/constraints
//	                    before the model decides
//	3. pre-action     — canonicalize, rewrite, or VETO the proposed action
//	                    before it hits the environment
//	4. post-feedback  — inspect the observation, trigger recovery when the
//	                    trajectory stalls
//
// The mapping to what this session already does is exact, which is the reason
// to adopt the naming rather than invent one:
//
//	episode-init   the turn's loop window (looped.go) and change ledger (recovery.go)
//	pre-decision   the tool-output stub passes (stub.go, turnfold.go)
//	pre-action     the approval gate, and the guardian inside it (consent.go, guardian.go)
//	post-feedback  the loop detector's nudge and its recovery escalation (looped.go, recovery.go)
//
// ── WHY THE REGISTRY IS PER TURN, NOT ON THE AGENT ──
//
// Two of the four citizens carry state that is a fact about ONE turn: the loop
// window, and the ledger of files this turn changed. looped.go's own comment
// says why that state may not outlive its turn — a detector remembering
// yesterday's repetitions nudges a model for a call it is making for the first
// time today — and a ledger remembering yesterday's edits would offer to revert
// work the person has already accepted. So the plane is built per turn, by
// [Agent.newEpisode], and dies with it. The Agent holds nothing: there is no
// registry to reset, no lock to take, and no way for one conversation's turn to
// see another's.
//
// A hook is therefore an object with an Agent in it, not a plugin: it reaches
// the turn's private state, which is the whole point of a seam INSIDE the loop.
// The interfaces are unexported for that reason — a hook that could be written
// outside this package could not touch anything worth hooking.
//
// ── THE LAW OF THE PLANE ──
//
// A hook is an ASIDE, with one exception. episode-init, pre-decision and
// post-feedback may not fail a turn and have no way to say so: they return
// nothing, and a panic in one is a bug in this package, not a turn the person
// loses. pre-action is the exception inside the plane and may STOP one call.
// Post-feedback may leave a terminal observation on the episode, but loop.go is
// the only owner allowed to spend it and end the turn because it owns the usage,
// request and checkpoint meter that a governed hand-off requires.

// ── the four hooks ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// episodeInitHook is `episode-init`: "set starting context/state".
//
// It runs once, at the top of a turn, before the first request is assembled. Its
// citizens hang the turn's own state off the episode — a window, a ledger — and
// nothing else: work done here is work done before anybody has asked for
// anything.

	// Name identifies the citizen in the plane's order, and in the failures of
	// the tests that assert it.
	Name() string
	EpisodeInit(ep *episode)
}

// preDecisionHook is `pre-decision`: "augment context with retrieved
// guidance/constraints before the model decides".
//
// It runs at the boundary where the next request's context is settled and the
// model has not yet been asked anything. The whole chain runs at the end of a
// completed turn, where old heavy results and old current-turn results become
// pointers before the compaction check weighs what remains. The current-turn
// fold also runs alone at tool-step boundaries because its bound applies inside
// a turn while the cross-turn stub's cache bargain does not. Anything that
// shapes WHAT THE MODEL WILL SEE belongs here: retrieved lessons, injected
// constraints, a memory read.
type preDecisionHook interface {
	Name() string
	PreDecision(ctx context.Context, ep *episode)
}

// preActionHook is `pre-action`: "canonicalize, rewrite, or veto the proposed
// action before it hits the environment".
//
// It runs inside [Agent.executeTool] — the one chokepoint every execution passes
// through, the batch's and the early start's alike (loop.go) — after the belt has
// been found to carry the tool and before the tool runs.
//
// The contract:
//
//   - The returned call is what runs. A citizen that canonicalizes hands back a
//     rewritten call; every citizen today hands back the call it was given. The
//     tool NAME is fixed by the dispatch that already happened, so a hook that
//     wants a different tool must veto and let the model ask again — a rewrite
//     that changed the name would run one tool's arguments through another's.
//   - false is a VETO, and the toolResult beside it is what the model reads
//     instead of the tool's output. It must say why, in words the model can act
//     on: a refusal it can work around is worth more than one that ends the turn.
//   - The first veto wins and the rest of the chain does not run. A call somebody
//     has already refused is not a call the next citizen has an opinion about.

//
// It runs at the step boundary, after a batch's results are in the transcript and
// before the next request is assembled — the one moment a note can ride into the
// next request the way a person's steering does (looped.go).
//
// It sees the calls and their results in call order, paired by index, plus the
// one batch-level fact of whether the assistant message carried visible text.
// It sees nothing else on purpose: a detector that read the whole transcript
// would be a second model's worth of judgement about a turn, and the
// deterministic stuck signals are the cheap half of recovery that works
// without one (PMCoder, https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.06811).

//     stat of the file the call is about to change.
//   - post-feedback runs THE LEDGER FIRST. The detector's escalation offers to
//     revert what this turn changed, and "this turn" has to include the batch
//     that just tipped the detector over — an offer computed before the ledger
//     read the batch would be an offer missing the very edit the model is stuck
//     repeating.
//
// The guardian is NOT a separate citizen. It lives where it has always lived,
// inside the gate's prompt branch (guardian.go), because its whole safety
// argument is positional: it sees only calls the policy already decided to ask
// about, and it can only turn that prompt into an allow. Registered beside the
// gate it would be a hook that could veto — which is exactly the power it must

	// is load-bearing — a command aimed outside the task's ground has to be
	// refused with a sentence about where it was aimed, because the git guard's
	// sentences are about the task's own copy and are false about anywhere else.
