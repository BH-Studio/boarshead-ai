// The plan side of the bash belt (docs/design/plandb-cli/DESIGN.md, the
// wiring section): the store the worker's `plandb` calls write, and the two
// pulse points that make the graph and the store one thing. THE STORE IS THE
// WORKER'S CLI's STORE and this file's store at once — one SQLite database in
// the session folder, found by both roads the same way (the runtime by path, the
// CLI by walking up from its own working directory) — so a task the model
// adds through bash is a task the runtime dispatches, and a node that lands
// is a task the plan says is done.
//
// LOCK ORDER, stated once because everything here depends on it: a pulse may
// hold the plan gate while taking the graph's mu (claimChild and admit take
// it internally), and nothing may hold the graph's mu while asking for the
// plan gate. Every pulse point — after a worker's bash call, at the end of its
// turn, when a fan slot goes back, and after a node lands — is called from
// code that holds neither, and the seed takes the plan gate BEFORE admit takes
// the graph's mu, never inside it.
