// THE SKETCH AS THE DIVISION, AS TESTS.
//
// A mark's second reader draws what is left of a turn, the turn is handed over,
// and the drawing rides the spec into the task that takes the work
// (task_divide_sketch.go). What is under test is that the harness then PUTS that
// drawing to the division road on the worker's behalf — through the same verb, the
// same gates and the same reviewer — instead of hoping a cheap worker will find
// the parts again.
//
// Everything here drives the real doors, for task_divide_test.go's reason: the
// whole of this road is that there is no second way to spawn work.

// ── the judge's yes arms the worker it was read beside (#958) ───────────────

// A JUDGED-WIDE TASK WHOSE FIRST PARTS THE REVIEWER REFUSES KEEPS THE VERB.
//
// Two readers answered two different questions here. The judge read the person's
// sentence and said the WORK was wide; the reviewer read one set of parts drawn
// out of that same sentence, before anybody had opened the material, and said
// THOSE were one job. The second answer does not undo the first — so the worker
// that is already running gains `divide_work` and the page that says how to use
// it, which is exactly what it would have been constructed holding while the
// judge was still asked in front of the work.
//
// IT IS ASSERTED FROM THE OUTSIDE: what the wire offered on the first request,
// and what the running worker's own belt and instructions carry once the reading
// has been joined. The join is the runner's (task_beside.go's law: no reading
// outlives the node that started it), so the node landing is a fact that happens
// after the refusal and everything it decided.
