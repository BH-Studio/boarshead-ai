// Line-level novelty: how much a result actually told the node, and how long it
// has been since the work itself moved.
//
// ── WHY A LINE AND NOT A RESULT ──
//
// The no-progress counter (task_run.go) asks one question of every step: did
// this teach the node anything it did not already know? The answer used to be a
// hash of the WHOLE result, which makes the question binary and makes it easy to
// answer yes by accident. One line of a sixteen-line result changing — a
// timestamp, a run counter, an elapsed time — makes the other fifteen new again,
// and the counter that exists to notice a node getting nowhere resets.
//
// MEASURED (a peer harness on the same benchmark family, and the same shape is
// reachable here): for two hours a worker rewrote its own measuring script four
// times and re-ran it six times against a deliverable it never touched. Every
// run printed `Starting at <date>` on its first line, so a whole-result detector
// saw six productive steps in a row while the score under it did not move by a
// point. A per-line estimator sees two new lines in sixteen and calls that what
// it is.
//
// So novelty is a RATIO: how many of a result's lines the node has never been
// told, over how many lines it has. It needs no list of volatile tokens, no rule
// about timestamps, and no idea what kind of work is being done — a line either
// came back before or it did not.
//
// ── AND WHY THE WORK'S OWN CLOCK IS BESIDE IT ──
//
// The ratio says how much the node is learning. It says nothing about whether
// the DELIVERABLE is moving, and the loop this file was written for is one where
// both answers are needed: the node was learning a little (new timings every
// run) about a thing it had stopped changing. [workClock] holds that structural
// fact — the step at which the work last changed, and what has happened since —
// and it is stated in words rather than acted on. NOTHING STOPS ON IT: the only
// threshold that ends anything is still the no-progress counter, now fed by the
// honest estimator above.

// taughtLineThreshold is how much of a result must be new before the step that
// fetched it counts as having taught the node something.
//
// ONE HALF, and the number is a judgement rather than a measurement, so here is
// the judgement. The two failures it sits between are not symmetric:
//
//   - TOO LOW (a tenth) and the estimator is the old one with extra arithmetic.
//     A sixteen-line result with a clock in it clears a tenth on the clock line
//     alone, which is exactly the defect above.
//   - TOO HIGH (nine tenths) and a real discovery is called a spin. `go test`
//     after a fix reprints most of its output and changes the four lines that
//     matter; a directory listing grows by one file; a log is tailed and has
//     three new lines at the end. All of those are the node finding out what it
//     went to find out, and all of them are mostly old bytes.
//
// A half says: MORE OF THIS ANSWER IS NEW THAN IS OLD. It is the one point on
// the scale that needs no argument about how much repetition is acceptable,
// because it is the point where the result stops being mostly a repeat. A
// one-line result that is new clears it outright (1 of 1), which is the case
// that must not be lost — a single new line is information.
//
// IT IS A CONSTANT AND NOT A SETTING. A threshold a task could raise would be a
// threshold a stuck task raises.

// noveltyGeneration is how many line hashes one generation of the memory holds

// between one and two of these and never more.
//
// BOUNDED BECAUSE A LONG RUN IS THE ORDINARY CASE. A node at its step limit can
// read a hundred thousand lines, and a set that grew with every one of them
// would be a leak whose size is decided by how much output the world happens to
// produce. Four thousand lines is many times the window any of this reasons

// and no bookkeeping; an LRU would give the same answer at several times the
// cost, to a question nobody asks.
//
// THE TOOL IS PART OF THE KEY, exactly as it was when this was a whole-result
// hash (task_run.go's [taughtSomething]): two hands that happen to answer the
// same bytes are two ways of learning the same thing, and the counter has always

// ── what a step added ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// progressLedger is the whole of one run's no-progress accounting: the lines it
// has been told, the questions it has already asked, and whether the deliverable
// has moved since the last thing it learned.
//
// ── LINE NOVELTY JUDGES A RE-MEASUREMENT AND NOTHING ELSE ──
//
// The ratio above is the right judge of ONE shape: the same question asked again
// of a deliverable that has not moved. That is where the measure→measure loop
// lives, and it is the only shape in which "most of this answer is a repeat"
// means "this step told me nothing". Two other shapes reach the same estimator
// and are not that, and reading them through the ratio kills working nodes:
//
//   - A READING TAKEN OVER A CHANGED DELIVERABLE IS INFORMATION BY CONSTRUCTION.
//     The node measured a state it had never measured before, and learning that
//     an edit moved little is still learning. MEASURED (SWE-Marathon s9, two
//     seeds, this binary): edit, `cargo build` reprinting the same warnings,
//     then a check reprinting a sixteen-row table in which three numbers had
//     moved — 3 of 16 is 19%, so build→check→build→check after real edits
//     counted as six dead steps and the node was landed after nine minutes of
//     work, right after its check went from ~0 to 21,838 passes. THE MOST
//     LEGITIMATE LOOP THERE IS, read as a spin.
//
//   - A QUESTION THE NODE HAS NEVER ASKED IS NOT A RE-MEASUREMENT. MEASURED
//     (SWE-Marathon s8, task 4, replayed in progress_law_test.go): six commands
//     in a row, each pulling a DIFFERENT method's expected shapes out of a
//     corpus of pretty-printed JSON. Every answer was new to the node and every
//     answer was mostly `    {`, `      "startLine": 1,` and `  }` — 4% to 20%
//     new lines — because structured data repeats its own scaffolding. Six of
//     those and the node was landed mid-survey.
//
// So the estimator is asked LAST, of the case it was built for, and the two
// structural facts are read first.
//
// ── AND WHAT STOPS THAT FROM BEING THE OLD DEFECT AGAIN ──
//
// "A new question counts" is one word away from "a new CALL counts", which is
// the activity detector lane/l replaced: nine `sleep N && tail jobs/1.log`
// commands, nine distinct strings, nine identical `(no output)` answers, and a
// counter that congratulated the node each time. The word is the answer. A
// question is only asked once, and it only counts when THE ANSWER BROUGHT
// SOMETHING BACK — a result with no new line in it at all told the node nothing,
// however novel the sentence that fetched it. The same journal contains both
// shapes three steps apart and this rule separates them: six greps of new
// records (13, 2, 9, 19, 22, 15 new lines) are information; the two one-line
// answers it had already been given are not.
//
// THE CHANGED-DELIVERABLE ARM CARRIES NO SUCH GUARD, deliberately. An identical
// reading after an edit is the sentence "your change did not move this", which
// is a fact about a state that did not exist a step ago; an identical reading
// after nothing changed is the same sentence twice.
