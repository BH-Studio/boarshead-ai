// WHAT A PIECE OF WORK COST, AFTER THE PROCESS THAT PAID FOR IT IS GONE.
//
// Three files carry a bill and each of them is asked one question here: the
// checkpoint (does a resumed node still know what it spent), the project index
// (can a landed row say at what rate, and over how many tokens), and the index
// again for an adaptive run (does the tank ever reach disk). The fourth law —
// that an older file without any of it still opens — is pinned first, because
// every field below is additive and a checkpoint written yesterday is the
// commonest file this build will ever be handed.
