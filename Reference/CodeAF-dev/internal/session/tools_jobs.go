// The background half of the belt: bash with one extra argument, and the jobs
// tool that looks at what it started.
//
// This file is the WINDOW onto jobs.go's registry. The split is deliberate:
// jobs.go owns processes, logs, and the steering note; this file owns the wire
// — the schemas the model sees and the sentences it reads back. The watch tool
// (tools_watch.go) is the third thing in this family and it uses the same
// registry, the same list, and the same kill.

// ── bash, wrapped ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// backgroundSentence is the one sentence the wrapper adds to pi's bash
// description. One sentence, not a paragraph: the tool is pi's, and a model
// that has read pi's description already knows what bash is.
//
// IT STATES THE CONTRACT AND NOT THE ROUTING. What a job leaves behind — a log
// and an exit code, and nothing else — is this tool's own contract, and it is
// still here because it is the fact that decides whether a long thing belongs
// on this door at all. Which road a piece of work belongs on is the page's
// table, stated once (beltfacts.go's `## Work or words`, and at length in the
// manual's own "A job is the wrong door for work whose result is a
// deliverable"); it used to be repeated here, in front of every request of
// every turn, which is 200 bytes of routing policy billed sixty times a task.
//
// AND THE ARRIVAL IS NOT SAID HERE AT ALL. That a finished job reports itself
// and must never be polled for was in this sentence, in the timeout sentence
// and in the background argument's own description — three copies of one law,
// all three billed on every request. The page now states it once for the whole
// family (prompts/system.md's `Anything handed off — a job, a watch, a task, a
// quick task — reports itself into this conversation; never sleep, tail or poll
// for it`, registered as `handoff.reports-itself`), so this tool states only
// what is its own.
const backgroundSentence = " Run long-lived commands (servers, watchers, long builds) with background:true and ask the jobs tool about them; a job leaves its log and an exit code and nothing else."

// timeoutSentence states the v3 foreground law pi leaves unstated: a call the
// model did not bound is bounded by the harness, because one hung command
// otherwise wedges the whole turn until the person interrupts.
//
// AND WHAT REACHING THE BOUND ACTUALLY DOES, because that changed and a model
// reasoning from "it will be killed" reasons wrongly: it hedges, splits the
// command, or starts again from nothing when the answer was already running
// (promote.go). What the promoted job then does — report itself, unpolled — is
// the page's own law for the whole family and is not repeated here.
//
// The figure is interpolated from [BashCeilingSeconds] rather than typed, on
// this codebase's one-source-of-truth law: a number in a description is read by
// the model as a fact about the machine, and a stale one is a lie it reasons
// from.
func timeoutSentence(backgroundAfter int) string {
	if backgroundAfter <= 0 {
		return " bash WAITS for the command: a foreground call runs for as long as your own timeout argument says, up to " +
			strconv.Itoa(BashCeilingSeconds) + "s, and is never turned into a job before then. One that outlives even that is NOT killed — it becomes a background job, and the call answers with the output so far and 'still running as job N; log at <path>'. Background calls never time out."
	}
	return " bash WAITS for the command: a foreground call runs for up to " + strconv.Itoa(backgroundAfter) +
		" seconds and is then kept running as a background job while you get its output so far and the job id. Its own timeout can move that handoff sooner and is capped at " +
		strconv.Itoa(BashCeilingSeconds) + " seconds. Background calls never time out."
}

// BashCeilingSeconds is THE bound on a foreground bash call — one number, read
// everywhere, typed once.
//
// ── WHY THE CEILING IS THE DEFAULT TOO ──
//
// There used to be two numbers: a 120-second default and a 600-second cap. The
// gap between them was measured and it was expensive. A scoring script that took
// three to five minutes hit the 120-second default on every call, was adopted as
// a job, and answered `still running as job N` — so a model that had asked for
// nothing of the kind was handed a background job it then had to chase, and the
// chasing (sleep, tail, sleep, tail) ate 68% of a ten-hour worker's wall clock
// while a competitor's harness, which simply waited, saw the same score
// thirty-eight times to our two.
//
// THE MODEL'S FIGURE IS HONOURED UP TO THIS CEILING. A session may hand the
// still-running command to the job registry sooner through its independently
// configured background-after clock; setting that clock to zero restores the
// timeout-only posture. Either handoff preserves the same process.
//
// The number itself lives with the bare tool (bare.BashCeilingSeconds), which
// now applies it as its own default too — a headless worker nobody is watching
// used to run `find /` unbounded — so the session, the bare loop and the surface
// that counts down all read one figure. Exported here so the surface need not
// know where it is kept.
const BashCeilingSeconds = bare.BashCeilingSeconds

// BashTimeoutSeconds is the bound one foreground bash call actually runs
// under: the model's own figure when it set a usable one, and
// [BashCeilingSeconds] when it did not or when it asked for more.
//
// It is the ONE READ of the timeout argument. The wrapper applies it to the
// wire args ([withTimeoutLaw]) and the surface counts down against it
// (internal/tui3's toolLimit), so the number a person watches and the number
// the command is bounded by cannot drift apart.
//
// AN EXPLICIT NULL IS UNSET, and so is a zero, a negative, a string, a NaN, or
// anything else that does not read as a positive number of seconds. A weak
// model that spells every optional argument out — `"timeout": null` — must not
// be able to disarm the law by saying nothing in more words: that value used to
// take the "set" branch, decode as 0, pass the cap test untouched, and reach
// bare as a nil timeout, which arms no timer at all. An unbounded foreground
// call is a turn that never ends.

//
// AND EVERY FIGURE IS INTERPOLATED. The ring's size, the spool's chunk size,
// the kill grace and the tail's bounds are all enforced somewhere else in this
// package ([jobRingBytes], [jobSpoolChunkBytes],
// [jobTermGrace], [jobsDefaultTail], [jobsMaxTail]); a digit typed here would be
// the second copy, and the second copy is the one that goes stale.
// AND IT DOES NOT OFFER POLLING AS A WAY TO WAIT. `output` is still here for an
// intermediate look at a job somebody asked about, but the sentence that used to
// invite a poll loop is gone and replaced by the fact that makes polling
// pointless: A FINISHED JOB REPORTS ITSELF. Every outstanding job's state also
// rides at the foot of a tool result whenever it has moved since the last one
// this turn carried (jobfooter.go), so "is it still going, and what did it last

// diet). This description carried it TWICE — once as "completions come to you"
// and once as "for an intermediate look and not for waiting" — while `watch` and
// `propose_task` each carried a third and a fourth copy. It is one law about
// everything handed off, so prompts/system.md states it once for all of them and
// the belt states none of it; the manual's own page answers it at length ("Does
// codeaf poll a background job, or does it get told", what-i-can-do.md). What
// this description keeps is the contract: which two kinds of work are here, what
// each op does, what comes back, and where the whole log lives.
