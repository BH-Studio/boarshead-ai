// DIVISION: a worker saying "this is wider than one pair of hands".
//
// A task is groomed before anybody has opened the material. The brief says
// "bring the eleven adapters up to the new interface" and nobody yet knows
// whether that is an afternoon or a fortnight, because the thing that decides
// it — how much of the eleven is mechanical and how much is not — is only
// visible from inside. propose_task already lets a node hand out parts it can
// name up front (task.go's fan-out law). What was missing is the other moment:
// the worker halfway through, holding the material, that can now see the work
// is wider than the envelope it was given.
//
// So a worker gets one more verb. `divide_work` names the parts it has found
// and the evidence that revealed them, and the parts become session workers
// under it — the SAME nesting road propose_task admits into, because a second
// spawning road would be a second set of rules about worktrees, cancellation,
// spend and reports, and the person would have two kinds of child to learn.
//
// ── THE TWO GATES, AND THEY ARE THE ONES THAT WERE MEASURED ──
//
// Division is not free. Every part pays for a worktree, an audit and a wait,
// and the swarm bench measured what that costs when it buys nothing: on the
// eight-task corpus, dividing work that was never wide lost outright, and
// dividing work that was wide won by 1.15× to 1.95× of wall clock
// (bench/swarm/AB-REPORT.md). Two gates came out of it, and both of them are
// asked here, in this order:
//
//   - THE EVIDENCE GATE. Does what the worker found actually enumerate enough
//     independent items for the parts to beat one worker doing them in order?
//     internal/splitgate is that question, and it is the same function and the
//     same floor the resident's planner and leaves are gated by — one decision,
//     asked in three places, because two implementations of it would become two
//     answers. It reads the EVIDENCE and not the briefs: what is being weighed
//     is what the worker saw, not how convincingly it wrote the parts up.
//   - THE CAPACITY GATE. Is anybody free to pick the parts up? A division into
//     five parts on a machine where every lane is held is five worktrees, five
//     audits and five waits buying exactly no wall clock, because the parts
//     queue behind the lanes that are already full. THE LAW IS: DO NOT DIVIDE
//     WHAT NOBODY IS FREE TO PICK UP.
//
// A REFUSED DIVISION IS NOT A FAILURE. The worker reads the answer and carries
// on as one worker, which is what it was doing a moment ago — nothing is
// cancelled, nothing is spent, and the node journals, spends and lands exactly
// as it would have if it had never asked. That is the whole bargain that lets
// the road be on by default: the gate refuses small work for free.
//
// ── AND ONE PLACE THE EVIDENCE GATE IS NOT THE LAST WORD ──
//
// The floor was measured on items a counter can see: a number standing beside
// a plural that is not a measure (internal/splitgate). Some work is wide in a
// shape any counter is blind to. Four whole ISSUES in one request are four
// ownable jobs with four done-conditions, and they enumerate NOTHING; so do four
// modules, which the bench measured losing. No amount of teaching a free counter
// over free text tells those two apart, and a floor tuned until it did would be
// a floor tuned to a benchmark's phrasing.
//
// So the floor does not move. What the road
// has instead is a TIEBREAK, and it fires on a disagreement rather than on a
// phrase: the evidence gate refuses on the count AND a model that read this
// request already said the work was broad ([taskSpec.armed] holds which reader
// armed the task, and [TaskNode.armedByJudgement] is the test). Two readers
// contradicting each other is not an answer, so the division is put to the one
// reader that can settle it — the DIVISION REVIEWER below, which was going to
// read these parts anyway, on the merits it already weighs. A floor refusal on
// UNARMED work, or on work the counter itself armed, is untouched: free, final,
// and one reader never gets to disagree with itself at a mastermind's price.
//
// THE CAPACITY GATE IS UNTOUCHED BY ALL OF IT and still binds after the
// reviewer's yes: nothing here can divide work nobody is free to pick up.
//
// ── AND THEN ONE CALL THAT READS THE PLAN ──
//
// The two gates measure whether a division is WORTH IT, and neither of them
// reads the parts: the evidence gate weighs what the worker saw, and the
// capacity gate counts free lanes. But the parts are the thing that actually
// gets built. A part's brief is that worker's WHOLE WORLD — it never sees the
// conversation and cannot ask anybody anything — and every one of them was
// written by whichever model the parent task happens to be running on, which on
// a cheap crew is the cheap one.
//
// So a division that has passed both gates is put ONCE to the tier that thinks
// ([roles.RoleDivision]), which reads the evidence, the parent's own brief and
// all of the parts TOGETHER — the one thing the worker writing them could not do
// — and answers with those parts approved, amended, merged, or refused as not a
// division at all.
//
// IT FAILS OPEN. A reviewer that errors, that times out, or that answers
// something the contract does not allow admits the ORIGINAL parts unchanged. The
// division has already earned its way past two gates that were measured, and a
// flaky second opinion must not be able to turn the road off — the honest
// failure of a second opinion is not having one. That is the OPPOSITE posture
// from the route judge's confirm (route_judge.go), which fails closed, and the
// difference is what each of them stands in front of: the confirm holds back
// work that nothing has vouched for yet, and this one only improves work two
// measured gates already passed.
//
// ONE CALL AND NO REPAIR TURN, for the reason the route judge states about
// itself: this is a judgement nobody asked for, and a second call to rescue the
// first would be spending somebody's money to argue with it.
//
// ── HOW MUCH THINKING A PART IS DONE WITH ──
//
// The parts of one division are not all the same kind of work. Eleven adapters
// to move onto a new interface are eleven jobs whose failure mode is NOT BEING
// DONE YET, which anybody can see; the twelfth part — work out why the fixture
// races — has a failure mode of QUIET WRONGNESS, which a cheap model does not
// fail loudly at. So a part carries a `grade`, and it is the dividing worker's
// own reading: `mechanical` — the default, and what a part that says nothing is
// — keeps the parent task's model, and `careful` resolves through
// [roles.RoleCareful], which is the high tier.
//
// IT IS A GRADE AND NOT A MODEL NAME, and no file on this road writes a model id
// anywhere. The field says what KIND of work the part is and the registry
// answers with a model, so an install that has configured no tiers mints every
// part on the parent's own model exactly as it did before the field existed
// (internal/roles' ladder floors on the session's own model).
//
// ── WHAT THIS IS NOT ──
//
// The resident's `request_split` ENDS the leaf's run and lets the parts replace
// it (internal/exec's linear.go). This does not, and the difference is the
// session engine's own law rather than a shortcut: a v3 task's parent stays and
// coordinates. It holds its node open, every part's report re-enters it as the
// report lands, and it makes one deliverable and one branch out of them
// ([runTaskChild]'s tail loop). A parent that vanished into its parts would
// leave five branches racing for the person's, which is the arrangement
// task.go's nesting law exists to prevent.

// reader of the work saying it looks wider than one pair of hands, and they
// cover the three doors work comes through: the typed command, the model's own
// belt, and the text of the brief itself.
//
//   - A MODEL THAT READ THE WORK SAID SO BEFORE IT WAS ADMITTED. A turn handed
//     over at the ceiling is read by a mastermind that draws its parts, and the
//     yes is banked against the goal the handover admits
//     ([Agent.rememberDivisible], checkpoint.go). A person's `/task` is NOT armed
//     this way any more: its sizing judge is asked beside the worker, after the
//     belt was built, and its yes arrives as a division proposed for that worker
//     (task_divide_sketch.go's [Agent.proposalBeside]) rather than as a verb the
//     worker would have had to reach for.
//   - THE PROPOSER SAID SO IN ITS OWN WORDS. propose_task carries a `wide`
//     argument ([taskSpec.wide], task.go), and it is the model's half of the
//     same flip: a chat model that judged the work broad is answering the
//     question the sizing judge is asked at the typed door, with the whole
//     conversation in front of it rather than one sentence. THAT JUDGEMENT IS
//     THE YES. It starts one worker and arms it — never a planner — which is
//     what stops "this is a broad multi-source sweep" from being a reflex that
//     reaches past this road entirely.
//   - THE WORK'S OWN TEXT ENUMERATES ENOUGH ITEMS. This is
//     cmd/codeaf/cooperative.go's plan-time gate asked of a task instead of a
//     plan: a brief that already names eleven adapter FILES is a brief that may
//     divide. It is what arms the road for work nobody ran the judge over — a
//     proposal the chat model groomed, `/task solo`, a person whose standing
//     answer is `single`. THE PILE IS LOAD-BEARING AND A COUNT ALONE IS NOT
//     ENOUGH: internal/splitgate reads a number only where a plural that is
//     not a measure stands with it, so "eleven adapters" counts eleven and
//     "keep it under 250 words" counts zero — the gate knows the closed class
//     of measures rather than an open list of things people have piles of,
//     precisely so a domain nobody anticipated ("34 person-rows") still
//     counts. The counting is free text over free prose all the same, which is
//     why this signal is the last of the three and never the one a door should
//     lean on by itself.
//
// Anything else is not armed, and a task that is not armed is byte-identical to
// a task from before this wave.
//
// IT ANSWERS WHICH SIGNAL AND NOT MERELY WHETHER, and an empty string is no.
// The word is kept on the spec because two later readers need to know which of
// the three it was: the tiebreak, which only reconsiders a floor refusal where a
// MODEL said the work was broad ([TaskNode.armedByJudgement]), and the project's
// own record, which otherwise cannot tell a task that refused to divide from one

//
// WHY IT HAS TO EXIST. The sizing judge used to answer before the node was
// admitted, so its yes was one of [Agent.armDivision]'s signals and the worker
// was CONSTRUCTED holding the verb. The judge is asked beside the worker now, so
// that nobody waits through it (task_beside.go), and an answer that lands after
// the belt was built can no longer be a construction-time signal. Left at that,
// it was no signal at all: a task a model had read as wide, whose first set of
// parts the reviewer then refused, ran to the end of its life with no way to
// hand anything out — however much of the material it opened, and however
// plainly the parts were there (#958). A refusal is a finding about the parts
// that were drawn; it never un-judges the width.
//
// THE RULES ARE NOT COPIED HERE. The yes goes into the bank the arming reads
// ([Agent.rememberDivisible]) and admission's own question is then asked again,
// of the same reader, with the fact it was missing — so a harness design, a
// quick task, a part of somebody else's division and work that is already armed
// are refused here by the very lines that refuse them at admission, rather than
// by a second list that would drift from the first.
//
// AND THE BELT AND THE PROMPT CANNOT DISAGREE, which is the law that froze
// arming at construction in the first place. Both are built from

// and in this order after the one write: the verb joins the belt at the tail
// through the door every late capability comes through ([Agent.armFamily], whose
// append law is what keeps the prefix cache), and then the prompt is re-rendered

var divideReviewBrief = `A worker part-way through a piece of work has decided it is wider than one pair of hands, and has written the parts it wants to hand out. You read the whole division ONCE and answer for it.

Each part becomes a worker of its own, in a copy of its own. It never sees this conversation and it cannot ask anybody anything. A part's ` + "`brief`" + ` is its SCOPE — what that one part works on, and only that: the work being divided and the map of what its siblings own are composed around every part before it is handed over, so a scope that restates them says the same thing twice. WHAT A PART OWNS IS WHAT ITS ` + "`acceptance`" + ` NAMES: the done-condition says what must be true once the part is finished, so it names what that part produces. Material several parts read is shared and belongs in the brief, not in a done-condition. A check that proves the whole proves nothing about a part: each part names the check that proves its own slice, and the whole is yours to make once, after their work is home.

READ THE PARTS TOGETHER, WHICH IS THE ONE THING THEIR AUTHOR COULD NOT DO:

  - two parts that would produce the same file. Fix the boundary in both done-conditions, or merge them into one part. Two parts that merely READ one file are not an overlap and never were. An overlap you leave standing is not a rough edge: a division whose done-conditions still name the same file when you are done is REFUSED OUTRIGHT and nothing is handed out, because everything the parts write goes into one deliverable and the file would be kept once, one part's work quietly over the other's.
  - a part that cannot start until another has finished. That is a stage and not a part: merge it into the part it waits on.
  - a scope that assumes what its author knew. Name the files, the symbols and the conventions THIS part works in. Where something nearby belongs to a sibling, say whose it is — "the report itself is another part's" — rather than leaving a worker to guess where its own share ends.
  - a done-condition that names no file while the part's brief names several. Write the file that part produces into it: that sentence is where ownership is read, so a part whose done-condition names nothing has claimed nothing, and one that names a sibling's file has claimed somebody else's. It is a boundary to sharpen, never a reason to refuse the division.
  - a done-condition somebody else could not check without taking the part's own word for it.

Answer with ONE JSON object and nothing else — no prose, no code fence:

  {"parts": [{"title": "...", "summary": "...", "brief": "...", "acceptance": "...", "grade": "` + gradeMechanical + `"}, ...]}

Those are the parts that will exist, in the shape you give them. Repeat a part unchanged to approve it, rewrite its brief to sharpen it, give one part where there were two to merge them. Write every field on every part, the grade included — a part you leave a field off is a part that loses it. At least 2 parts and at most ` + strconv.Itoa(taskFanLimit) + `.

  grade  "` + gradeCareful + `" for a part whose failure mode is subtle wrongness — a design decision, tricky debugging, a judgement about somebody else's code — and "` + gradeMechanical + `" for a part whose failure mode is simply not being done yet. It decides how much thinking that part is done with, so it is worth being right about in both directions.

REFUSE ONLY WHEN THIS IS NOT A DIVISION AT ALL — the parts are stages of one procedure, or there is really one job here:

  {"refuse": true, "why": "one line, in a person's own words"}

Refusing throws nothing away: the worker carries on with the work in its own hands. It is not the answer to a division you would have written differently — amend that one instead.

AND ONE ANSWER MORE, FOR THE CASE WHERE THERE IS NO JOB LEFT FOR ANYBODY HERE:

  {"refuse": true, "nobody": true, "why": "one line, in a person's own words, saying what only a person can do"}

Add "nobody" ONLY when what is left cannot be done by a worker at all, however many of them there were: an approval or a signature only a named human may give, a credential or an account nobody here holds, a decision that is the person's to make, or work that is simply somebody else's system doing something by itself. Say what the person has to do, in their words.

IT IS NOT THE WORD FOR A DIVISION YOU THINK IS UNWISE. "This is really one job", "these parts overlap", "this would not pay" and "I would rather one worker did this" are all the plain refusal above, and the worker gets on with the work. "nobody" STOPS THE WORK AND PUTS IT IN FRONT OF A PERSON, so it is worth being sure: if one worker could still make progress on any part of what is left, this is not it.`

// divideAdjudicateAsk is the head of the question on the one path where this
// call decides whether the work divides at all rather than how well.
//
// IT ASKS FOR A JUDGEMENT AND NOT FOR A COUNT. What put this division in front
// of the reviewer is that counting the items said no while a model reading the
// request said the work was broad, and the reviewer settles that by reading the
// PARTS: independence, whether each is a whole job somebody could own, and
// whether handing them out pays for the copy of the repository and the check
// each one costs. The two answers it may give are the two it already has, so
// nothing new is being taught here — only which question is on the table.
const divideAdjudicateAsk = `THIS ONE IS YOURS TO DECIDE, not merely to sharpen. The work was started by somebody who read the request and judged it broad, and what the worker has found does not obviously enumerate a pile of like-for-like items. So the question is whether these parts are a division at all:

  - could ONE person take each part from start to finished, knowing nothing of what the others produced? Not a step of one job — a whole job with its own end.
  - is what each part owns genuinely separate from what the others own — different files, different questions, nothing half-finished passing between them?
  - and does handing them out actually pay? Every part costs its own working copy, its own check and its own wait, so a handful of small edits one worker could do in order is not worth dividing however separate they are.

Yes to all three: answer with the parts, as usual. Any of them no: refuse, and the worker carries on as one worker with nothing lost.`
