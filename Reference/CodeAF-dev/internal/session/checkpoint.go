// THE CHECKPOINT: what a turn costs, priced against what handing it over costs.
//
// Two mechanisms already stand between a chat message and a grind, and both of
// them decide BEFORE there is any evidence to decide on. prompts/system.md
// teaches the model to hand work over the moment it can name the scale in front
// of it, and a model deep in tool momentum does not stop to re-consult a verb it
// rarely reaches for. route_judge.go asks a second model about the REQUEST,
// racing the turn rather than standing in front of it, and its cheap screen
// declines the very message this exists for: four independent pieces of work in
// one paragraph, answered twice in measurement by ninety-odd rounds of inline
// tool calls.
//
// What neither has is a reading taken WHILE THE WORK IS HAPPENING, when the cost
// is a fact rather than a guess. That is what this file is, and it is now the
// ONE door out of a running turn ([Agent.handOverRunningTurn]). The race used to
// be the other one; it was demoted to triage in the same wave that measured this
// question, and what its both-yes does now is TIGHTEN THIS METER so the first
// mark lands at the next step boundary instead of after the full price
// ([checkpointMeter.tighten]).
//
// ── THE FRAME IS SKI RENTAL ──
//
// Working in the conversation is RENTING: it costs a little per round and it
// never stops costing. Handing the work to the graph is BUYING: one fixed price
// — a worktree opened and closed, a brief written, somebody independent reading
// the result — and after it the work runs supervised, with a budget, a repair
// loop and a rail the person can stop it from.
//
// The competitive answer to rent-versus-buy is to rent until you have spent what
// buying costs, and then buy. That is exactly the shape here, with one softening
// and one hardening:
//
//   - NOTHING HERE IS DECIDED ON WHAT THE TURN IS ABOUT. Neither rung reads a
//     word of the subject: the notes are counted in finished tool rounds and the
//     ceiling is a property of the machine the turn is running on. So there is no
//     phrasing that defeats this and no kind of work it is tuned for.
//   - AND THE RENT IS TOLD TO THE ONE READER THAT CAN PRICE IT. At each note rung
//     the turn is handed what it has run up and the roads on, and NOBODY IS ASKED
//     ANYTHING ([checkpointChoiceNote], inherit.go): the model holding the work is
//     the only party that knows what carrying it elsewhere would cost, because
//     only it knows what re-reading everything it has read would buy.
//   - AND THE LAST RUNG IS NOT RENT AT ALL. Spending is not a reason to end a
//     turn; being unable to carry on is. The ceiling fires on a turn that can no
//     longer work where it is ([Agent.turnHasRunAway]) and moves the REMAINING
//     work onto the one road, where it is watched — and remaining is the whole of
//     what is still asked there ([checkpointNothingLeft]): a turn that answers
//     the handoff by saying it is finished is left to finish, which is not the
//     harness asking again but the harness having nothing to move.
//
// ── WHY THE MARKS ARE GEOMETRIC AND NOT ONE LINE ──
//
// A single threshold is a single chance to be wrong. Doubling the interval means
// a turn that is honestly one long job is told a bounded number of times — twice,
// the second at [checkpointRatio] times the handoff price — while a turn that is four jobs in
// a trench coat hears it early, when the findings are still worth handing over. A
// note costs no call, but it costs the turn's attention, so saying it gets rarer
// as the evidence that the answer is carrying on accumulates. [checkpointRatio]
// is the whole of that policy.
//
// ── WHY THE MARK IS READ BY SOMEBODY ELSE ──
//
// This used to be a question INJECTED INTO THE RUNNING TURN. A line rode the
// ambient note lane at each mark, said the answer had now cost more than handing
// it over would have, and asked the model to say in one line whether what was
// left was one job or several independent parts. It was measured off-policy over
// 240 completions against real recorded transcripts at the round-ten mark
// (bench/oneroad/replay/RESULTS.md), and the finding that killed it is not that
// the answers were wrong. It is that THERE OFTEN WAS NO ANSWER: the running chat
// model emitted a tool call instead of answering between 17% and 53% of the time,
// depending on the phrasing. A mechanism whose decision is left to a model in
// tool momentum is a mechanism that is off in exactly the momentum it exists to
// interrupt.
//
// The mastermind tier answered the same questions on the same transcripts with
// 0% to 7% unanswered. So the READING is done BY A SIDECAR ([Agent.readMark]):
// one call, on the tier that thinks, over the transcript the turn has built —
// and the running model is never asked to answer anything.
//
// WHICH IS WHY THE NOTE RUNGS ASK NOTHING RATHER THAN ASKING CHEAPLY. A line does
// ride into the turn at those rungs (inherit.go's [checkpointChoiceNote]), and
// the difference between it and the mechanism the measurement killed is the whole
// of what was learned: it is told and not asked, it needs no answer to be worth
// sending, and a turn that replies to it with a tool call has lost nothing. The
// one reading that must come back is the one at the ceiling, and that is the one
// the sidecar takes.
//
// ── AND WHAT IT IS ASKED FOR IS A SHAPE AND NOT A DECISION ──
//
// Four phrasings were measured against both models. The one that asks the reader
// to DECIDE — "one job, or several independent parts" — scored 96% on the traps
// and 67% on the one genuinely wide case. The one that asks it to SKETCH what
// remains as parts and arrows ([checkpointSketchAsk]) scored 58% on the traps and
// 100% on the wide case, with nothing ambiguous and nothing unanswered at all.
//
// THE ASYMMETRY PICKS THE SKETCH. A wrong SPLIT costs one downstream check: the
// task is armed, the worker MAY reach for divide_work, and both the evidence gate
// and the division reviewer still stand in front of any actual division
// (task_divide.go) — the reviewer now adjudicates even a floor refusal on
// judge-armed work, so an over-suggestion is refused for free. A wrong CONTINUE
// costs THE WHOLE ROAD, silently, on precisely the turn this was built for. So
// the reading that never misses width and over-suggests on single jobs is the
// right shape of wrong.
//
// ── AND THE HARNESS DOES THE DECIDING ──
//
// What comes back is PARSED AND NEVER INTERPRETED: the first line, split on a
// top-level ' | ', and two or more parts is a SPLIT ([parseCheckpointSketch]).
// Everything else is a CONTINUE — one part, a fork nested under a first step,
// prose, an empty answer, a call that never came back, an install with no
// mastermind to ask. THAT FAIL-OPEN IS SAFE BECAUSE THE CEILING IS THE RECOVERY
// BOUND: a turn whose sidecar can never be reached is a turn the last mark moves
// anyway, which is what this file did before any of it was read.
//
// ── WHAT THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO ──
//
// It opens no new door into the graph. Both marks and the ceiling admit their
// task through [Agent.launchRouteTask], which is the road route_judge.go already
// takes for work nobody groomed: straight to [TaskGraph.admit], no card, told
// after.

	// that read ten files in 48 seconds was moved by it, and its worker then spent
	// 551,000 tokens reading them again. What ends a turn is a reading of RUNAWAY

	// where the note has nothing to say. Measured on a real planning turn
	// (2026-09-12): the verdict landed two rounds in, the first [taking stock]
	// fired at round three over one issue and two listings — 43 KB of mostly
	// listing noise — and the model waved the note past, which is what taught
	// it the round-twenty note could be waved past too. A telling its reader
	// has learned to ignore is not a cheap telling; it is the mechanism's
	// credibility spent at a rung that held no facts worth weighing.

	// the reader sees what the running model sees — and it was measured on a crew
	// run over four pieces of work: three marks fired, the sidecar read 57k, 65k
	// and 91k input tokens on the mastermind tier, and the three reads cost $0.62
	// between them against $0.123 for the whole of the sixty-two calls that did
	// the actual work. AT THE MASTERMIND'S PRICE A RAW READ COSTS MORE THAN THE
	// WORK IT IS JUDGING, which turns a meter built to save a person money into
	// the largest line on their bill — and all three reads answered "carry on".

	// So the reader is shown an ACCOUNT of the work instead ([checkpointDigest]):

	// what the smallest of them was charged for, which puts a read back at cents.
	//
	// AND IT USED TO CARRY NO RESULTS AT ALL, ON AN ARGUMENT THAT WAS MEASURED
	// FALSE. The argument was that nothing inside a tool result changes the SHAPE
	// of what is left — that the shape is decided by what was asked, what was done
	// and what is still open. On a real ten-hour benchmark run that turned the
	// reader into the one participant who could not see the evidence: the turn had
	// `Loaded 68186 golden test points … Passed: 0` in front of it, had enumerated
	// twelve protocol methods and had ninety-seven compile errors on the screen,
	// and the reader — shown a ledger of verbs and paths — sketched a serial chain
	// three times running. A result is not noise when it is the only statement of

// model asked to draw one line answers with one line. Across both models it left
// nothing ambiguous and nothing unanswered, where every phrasing that asked for a
// judgement was ignored outright on a quarter to a half of the turns.
//
// IT NAMES NOTHING ABOUT THE KIND OF WORK, which is the law prompts/system.md and
// the ceiling's line are both held to. codeaf is a general harness: a research
// sweep, a writing project and a mechanical change are one shape of problem to
// this question, and a sentence about files would read as an instruction about
// programming to a reader watching a literature review.
//
// AND IT CARRIES NO THRESHOLD AND NO PRICE. The reader is not told what the turn
// has cost, because a number invites it to answer about the number. It is shown
// the work and asked what is left of it.
//
// THE LEGEND IS ASKED FOR BECAUSE THE SHAPE ALONE IS USELESS TO A WORKER. `A | B
// | C` is what the harness parses; "A is the validation workflow, B is …" is what
// rides into the brief so that whoever takes the work has the parts already named
// ([checkpointSketch.head]).
//
// AND IT NAMES THE TWO THINGS THE DIGEST PUTS IN FRONT OF IT. The reader used to
// be handed the transcript, where "what remains" could only mean "of whatever
// this conversation is about"; it is now handed an account whose first section is
// the person's own ask ([checkpointDigest]), so the question is anchored to it —
// what remains OF THE ASK, read against what has been done. THE GRAMMAR HALF IS
// UNTOUCHED, from "independent parts" to the end: that is variant C word for
// word, it is what both models were scored on, and it is what the parser is
// pinned to.
//
// AND IT TEACHES THE SECOND TOKEN FOR THE SAME REASON IT TEACHES THE FIRST.
// `(done)` exists because a reader that was never told how to say "nothing is
// left" says it in a sentence nobody can parse; `(waiting)` exists because a
// reader that was never told that work already handed out is not a part DRAWS IT
// AS ONE. Measured live 2026-09-01: a conversation with four pieces out spent a
// turn watching them, the honest sketch of that turn was "wait for the second |
// wait for the third | wait for the fourth", and three parts is a split — so the
// turn was converted into a task whose whole brief was to review reports and
// accept work that a worker in its own copy cannot see, let alone accept. The
// exclusion is stated in the ask, and the fold that reads it back is
// [checkpointSketch.handsBack].
//
// AND IT SAYS THAT WHAT IS DONE IS NOT WHAT IS LEFT, which is a repair rather
// than a tidiness. WHAT COMES BACK FROM HERE BECOMES THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THE
// BRIEF, under the words "WHAT IS LEFT, AS PARTS" ([checkpointSketch.head]) — so
// a reader that drew work the turn above it had ALREADY FINISHED handed the next
// pair of hands a louder, earlier instruction to do it again, while the evidence
// section further down that same document correctly said it was done and pointed
// at what came back (admission.go). Measured 2026-09-10: a worker opened on
// exactly that brief and spent its first minutes re-reading what the parent had
// read and re-deriving what the handoff had already stated. The contradiction
// cannot be repaired downstream, because by the time the two halves are in one
// document they already disagree — so the reader that draws the line is the one
// that has to be told, and the writer of the prose half is told the same thing in
// the same change ([checkpointHandoffWriteAsk]).

	// would read that firing as "never fired" and hand the turn the very
	// re-arming this latch exists to stop.
	//
	// THE NET IS A CONDITION AND NOT A BOUNDARY, WHICH IS WHY IT NEEDS THIS. The
	// ladder's rungs are rounds and a round happens once; "this turn cannot work
	// where it is" is true of a quantity that only grows, so it is true at every
	// boundary after the first one it is true at. Three of the endings below

// another piece's report, it cannot accept anything on anybody's behalf, and it
// cannot wait for something it was never told about — so a part that asks for any
// of those is a part with nobody to give it to. Handing one over buys a worker
// that opens its brief, finds nothing it can act on, and spends its whole
// deadline failing to.
//
// THE READING IS THE SHAPE'S OWN AND NOT A RULE ABOUT ENGLISH, as far as a
// vocabulary can be: it folds the two places a drawing puts a coordination verb —
// the word a part OPENS on, and a last stage that is a BARE verb with no object —
// and it folds nothing else. `review the manuscript` is work and reads as work,
// because the verb has something after it; `the second report > review` is a
// hand-back, because the stage the drawing ends on names nothing to review that
// this conversation is not already holding. It is the same fold
// [checkpointDoneShapes] makes of `(done)`, applied per part.
//
// AND IT TAKES ALL THE PARTS OR NONE. One coordination part beside two real ones
// is a turn with real work in it, and refusing that split would cost the road the

// nothing to hand out.

// THE QUESTION IT ANSWERS IS "HOW MANY PAIRS OF HANDS COULD START NOW", which is

// at THIS moment, before anything else has to have happened.
//
// THE RULES, WITH THE EXAMPLES THE ASK ITSELF GIVES:
//
//   - `A | B | C` is THREE parts, and a SPLIT. Nothing has to happen before
//     anything else, so three pairs of hands can start now.
//   - `A > B > C` is ONE part, and a CONTINUE. It is a chain: the second step
//     cannot begin until the first is done, so handing it out buys nothing.
//   - `A > (B | C)` is ONE part, and a CONTINUE. The fork is real, but it is
//     BEHIND a step that has not happened yet — at THIS mark the work in front of
//     the turn is A, which is one job. This is the stricter reading of the
//     benchmark's own scoring, and re-scoring variant C that way took the
//     mastermind's trap accuracy from 58% to 100%.
//   - `A > B | C > D` is TWO parts, and a SPLIT: two chains that wait on nothing
//     but themselves. THE BAR BINDS LOOSER THAN THE ARROW, which is why it is read
//     first — a reading that cut on arrows first would find `A` in front of
//     everything and call two independent chains one job.
//   - `(A | B | C) > D` is THREE parts, and a SPLIT: three jobs that can start now
//     and one step that gathers them afterwards. So is `(A | B) > C`, at two. The
//     gathering step is not a fourth part and is not lost — it is what the PARENT
//     does once the reports land (task_divide_sketch.go's [drawnDivision.afterParts]).
//   - anything with no separator at all — a word, a sentence, an apology — is one
//     part, and a CONTINUE.
//
// THE BRACKETED FIRST STAGE IS WHY THIS STOPPED READING THE WHOLE LINE ALONE, and
// it is a measurement rather than a preference. A whole-line reading counted
// `(A | B | C) > D` as one bracketed group and therefore as one part — and on the
// four-issue batch that is the shape kimi actually draws: it found the four-way
// fork 6 times out of 6 at round ten and wrote it as parts-then-gather every
// time, so the shipping parser read SPLIT on 2 of 12 batch reads where reading the
// first stage reads 6 of 6 (bench/oneroad/replay/RESULTS-2.md). The cost of the
// rule on the traps is 4 more splits out of 72 reads, every one a genuine
// two-way `(A | B) > C`, which is a division the evidence gate and the reviewer
// stand behind anyway (task_divide.go).
//
// A separator with nothing beside it does not make a part, so a line that opens
// or ends on one counts what is actually there. Brackets of any kind nest, and an
// unbalanced closer is ignored rather than taken below zero: a shape a model
// mis-typed is still a shape, and the honest failure is to read it as narrow.

// other three for the same reason they are spelled apart from each other: a bench
// reading the file has to tell a turn the clock moved from a turn the counters
// moved, and it can only do that if the row says so.

// turn WITHOUT reading it ([Agent.checkpointReopen]'s gates), and a refusal
// nobody can find afterwards is exactly what #567 was: two runs that behaved

// THE MEASURED FAILURE. SWE-Marathon s4, 00:01:54Z. The round-40 ceiling ran this
// ladder. The running model's draft came back as seven tokens nobody could work
// from; the mastermind that writes the real brief was asked and never answered,
// and its call was cut by [checkpointHandoffWindow] exactly ninety seconds later.
// Both upper rungs returned "", the task opened on the person's raw request, and
// the worker then spent twelve minutes and seventy calls re-deriving what the
// chat already held. The same run's s2 twin ran the same ladder in 1.5 s and its
// task opened on a 3.5 KB account of what had been learned.
//
// AND NOTHING WHATEVER WAS WRITTEN DOWN. The two runs left IDENTICAL journals at
// that moment — one ceiling line reading `moved` — so the difference between a
// worker that knew everything and a worker that knew nothing existed in no file.
// The failure itself was silent twice over: [Agent.writeHandoff] answered "" for
// six different reasons with one spelling, and the errand underneath returned on
// its own dead deadline before the row that would have named it was written
// (auxiliary.go's [Agent.callRole]).
//
// So EVERY RUNG SAYS WHAT IT DID, on its own journal line ([journalCarry]), and

//
// ── WHY AN ACCOUNT AND NOT THE CONVERSATION ──
//
// [checkpointDigestTokens] carries the measured bill. The short version is that a
// mastermind reading a raw transcript costs more than the work it is judging, and
// on the run that was measured it did so three times to say "carry on" three
// times.
//
// ── AND WHY THIS IS NOT A LOSS ──
//
// The question is what REMAINS OF THE ASK, and the four things that answer it are
// all here:
//
//   - THE ASK ITSELF, verbatim and first, because everything else is measured
//     against it and it is the one thing on this road nobody may rewrite
//     (task_brief.go).
//   - THE LEDGER: one line per tool call, the tool's name and the argument that
//     says what it touched. It is the COMPLETE account — ninety calls at eighty
//     bytes is seven thousand — and it is fitted before the results for that
//     reason: a reader that has lost the far end of the history has lost less than
//     a reader that has lost the newest thing it learned.
//   - WHAT CAME BACK, from the newest calls, each clipped to
//     [checkpointResultBytes] and printed newest-first. This is where the evidence
//     is. A ledger says a suite was run; a result says it reported `Passed: 0`,
//     which is the difference between a reader that can subtract the finished part
//     of the ask and a reader guessing at it.
//   - WHAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN OR CHANGED, deduplicated out of the same ledger,
//     because a thing already produced is a part of the ask already discharged and
//     that is exactly what the reader is being asked to subtract.
//   - THE LAST THING SAID, clipped, which is the running model's own account of
//     where it has got to and the only part of this a person would recognise.
//
// ── AND IT IS ASSEMBLED DETERMINISTICALLY ──
//
// No summariser, for [Agent.checkpointBrief]'s reason: a pass over text this
// session already holds is expensive at the worst moment and lossy by

//
//   - A NODE NEVER CHECKPOINTS. Work inside a task already lives under
//     governance — its own step cap, its own no-progress detector, its own
//     deadline and its own checker (task_run.go) — so a second ceiling over the
//     top of those would be the harness governing the governed, and the task it
//     started would be a third level of a tree that is two deep by law.
//   - A SCREENLESS SESSION WITH NOBODY LEFT IN CHARGE NEVER CHECKPOINTS. A
//     headless session that holds a [Person] has no one to read the line, and a
//     ceiling there would end a turn somebody is waiting on the answer of with a
//     task nobody will see land. A screenless session with a goal owner has
//     exactly the reader an unattended ending needs, so it takes the same road as
//     a watched conversation.
//   - AND NOT A LINE THE SESSION WROTE THAT NOBODY OWES AN ANSWER FOR. An ambient
//     note — a standing run's own instruction, a delta nobody has to reply to — is
//     the session talking to itself, and ending one of those with a task would be
//     the session spending money on its own sentence.
//   - AND NOT MID-INTERRUPT. A turn the person has just stopped is a turn they
//     have said they do not want; moving its remains onto the rail would be
//     answering an interrupt with a task.
//
// AND A WOKEN TURN IS METERED NOW, WHICH IS A REVERSAL AND A MEASURED ONE.
//
// The rule used to be "only what a person typed", and both of the shapes a wake
// arrives in were refused by it: a note the model owes an answer for is `wake`,
// and the turn it starts opens with an EMPTY message because the note itself is
// on the steering queue ([Agent.wakeLocked]). So the first two lines of the old
// gate turned the meter off for every turn a landing task began.
//
// ON A REAL TEN-HOUR RUN THAT WAS THE WHOLE FAILURE. A task landed, the wake note
// started a turn, and that turn made 127 tool calls over 46 minutes with no mark,
// no ceiling and no handover — it ended when the model stopped talking, and the
// harness then sat idle for the remaining seven and a half hours of the ask. The
// argument for the refusal was that a woken turn "already carries a budget of its
// own", and it does not: a budget belongs to the TASK that landed, and the
// conversation turn that reads its report is an ordinary chat turn with an
// ordinary chat turn's total absence of governance.
//
// SO THE ONLY THING THAT STILL DECIDES IS WHETHER ANYBODY IS OWED AN ANSWER. A
// wake is owed one by definition ([userMessage.wake]) and an empty opening
// message is what a wake looks like from in here, so both are metered exactly as
// a typed message is — same ladder, same price, same ceiling, same handover.

//
// Everything above this line prices a turn that is going on too long. Nothing
// anywhere priced a turn that stopped too soon, and on a measured ten-hour
// benchmark all three harnesses in the comparison — this one included — ended
// with hours of the ask unused. A turn ends when the model emits no tool call,
// and a model emits no tool call for two quite different reasons: because the
// work is done, and because it has reached a natural-sounding place to stop. "I
// have finished the parser, next I will wire up the handlers" is the second one,
// and it ended the turn just as firmly as the first.
//
// ── SO THE ASK IS READ AGAINST THE WORK, BY SOMEBODY ELSE ──
//
// The same reader, the same digest and the same remains contract the ceiling uses
// ([checkpointRemainsAsk]). MET ends the turn exactly as today. NOT MET re-opens
// it with the reader's one line as a synthetic continuation, and the running
// model carries on from where it stopped.
//
// ── AND THREE THINGS BOUND IT ──
//
//   - THE PERSON'S OWN QUESTION ENDS A TURN, ALWAYS. A turn whose last words ask
//     the person something is a turn WAITING, and re-opening it would be the
//     harness answering a question that was addressed to somebody else. It is read
//     structurally ([endsAskingThePerson]) and never by keyword, because a rule
//     that knew what "shall I" looked like would be a rule about English.
//
//   - A TURN THAT TOUCHED NOTHING AND THE METER NEVER THOUGHT WORTH ONE READING
//     IS NOT WORTH A REMAINS-READING EITHER. The price gate is the mark ladder's
//     FIRST RUNG ([checkpointMeter.markAt]), which keeps it a cost gate in the
//     meter's own currency rather than a content one, exactly like every other
//     trigger in this file — and keeps it on the SAME number, from the same
//     constant, that already decides when a running turn has become dear enough to
//     interrupt. It was one finished round until that was measured: `bash ls` is
//     one round, so EVERY small turn that touched a tool paid a mastermind call —
//     $0.001 to $0.002, a third to a half of a tiny ask's whole bill — and in eight
//     of nine measured runs the call re-opened nothing. A turn that only LOOKED has
//     not done enough work to have left any of it half-done, and charging it a
//     mastermind call anyway would be the bill this file's own digest exists to
//     prevent. route_judge.go already reads the turn that answered in words alone
//     and asks the other question about it. THIS RUNG IS A PERSON'S TURN'S RUNG:
//     it protects a cheap message somebody is sitting in front of, and a WOKEN
//     turn — a task landing's, nobody typed and nobody waiting — is never held by
//     it, because there is no person to carry the cheap one on (see the wake
//     carve-out at the gate itself, and [Agent.wakeLocked]).
//
//   - BUT THE READER IS GATED ON EXPOSURE, NOT ON PRICE. A turn that CHANGED THE
//     WORKING TREE and then stopped without anybody looking at the change is read
//     for what remains whatever it cost ([turnLeftTheTreeUnchecked]) — because the
//     thing a cheap turn cannot leave behind is a half-done job, and the thing it
//     very much CAN leave behind is an unbuilt edit.
//
//     SWE-Marathon s10, 10:35Z: a turn woken by a job's exit ran six rounds,
//     overwrote an 18,771-byte source file, said "now let me build and run the full
//     test suite" WITHOUT calling anything, and sealed. Six is under the first rung,
//     so the price gate returned early and nothing read the turn; the file it had
//     just written was the six compile errors the run shipped with, and three hours
//     of the ask went unspent. The rounds were cheap. The exposure was total.
//
//     WHAT COUNTS AS EXPOSURE IS THE DIGEST'S OWN FACT AND NOT A SECOND OPINION
//     ABOUT TOOLS: [checkpointLedger] already names the writers and the workClock
//     already holds the step the deliverable last moved on (novelty.go), so the
//     whole rule is "the last thing this turn did was change something". A turn
//     that wrote and then ran ANYTHING — a build, a test, a read of what it just
//     wrote — has had its change looked at by the one party that could, and it goes
//     back on the price gate like every other turn. That bounds the new spend to
//     turns whose last act was a write, which is a small set and is exactly the set
//     that was measured going wrong.
//
//   - AND THE METER IS THE ONLY COUNTER. A re-open is charged as a ROUND, through
//     the ordinary [Agent.checkpointRound], which is what "on the same meter"
//     has to mean if it is to mean anything: the marks still fire, a re-opened
//     turn that reaches the ceiling hands off as usual, and a model that would
//     answer the continuation with the same sentence forever is stopped by the
//     ceiling rather than by a second number invented here. There is no re-open
//     counter, and there must not be one.
//
// EVERY FAILURE ENDS THE TURN, which is the opposite fail-open direction from the
// marks and is the honest one here. A reader nobody can reach, a window that ran
// out, an install with no mastermind: each answers MET, and the turn ends as it
// did before this existed. The alternative — re-opening on silence — is a harness
// that will not let a conversation finish on the day its sidecar goes down.
//
// It reports whether the turn CARRIES ON, and whether it is OVER: a re-open that
// crossed the ceiling is a turn that ended by being handed over, which is neither
// of the two ordinary answers and belongs to the caller's `return true`.
// AND THE LAW THAT COST THE MEASURED RUN ITS EVENING ─────────────────────────
//
// A TURN THAT ENDED IN AN ERROR IS NEVER READ FOR WHAT REMAINS. THE ERROR IS
// WHAT REMAINS, and the retry ladder above already owns it.
//
// SWE-Marathon run s2, 22:45 UTC: three calls in fifteen seconds came back with
// no content, no tool call and no usage — failed calls, dressed as empty answers
// (loop.go) — and each one looked to this function exactly like a turn that had
// stopped short. It read the remains three times at mark-reader prices, re-opened

//
// THERE IS EXACTLY ONE ANSWER THAT LEAVES THE TURN RUNNING, and it is not a third
// sketch: it is the model saying nothing remains at all
// ([checkpointNothingLeft]) with no independent remainder named by the sketch. The ceiling
// exists to move A GRIND somewhere it is watched, and a turn that is finishing is
// not a grind — but a running model declaring itself finished is the model
// grading its own work, which is exactly the reading this whole file was rebuilt
// to stop relying on. It was measured doing it: a turn declared nothing was left
// at the ceiling, the handover was dropped, and the same model then ground on for
// twenty more rounds unwatched. So the drop is believed ONCE PER REQUEST and the
// ceiling comes back to meet a turn that carries on working past its own claim
// ([Agent.handOverRunningTurn], [checkpointMeter.believeDone]).
//
// EVERYTHING ELSE IT DOES IS [Agent.handOverRunningTurn]'S. It contributes the

// nothing if it is wrong, because it only means the worker MAY discover the work
// is wide and the evidence gate still refuses a division the material does not
// support (task_divide.go).
//
// THE SKETCH RIDES ALONG WHEN THERE IS ONE, and it now does two jobs rather than
// one. A drawing of what is left is exactly what the worker's first paragraph
// should be — and where it draws INDEPENDENT PARTS it is a second mind stating
// that work remains, which is the one reading that refuses a completion claim
// ([Agent.handOverRunningTurn]).
//
// AND THIS IS THE ONE MOMENT THAT WRITES ITSELF DOWN. What the ceiling did to a
// turn used to exist nowhere: a run where the handover was dropped and a run where
// it never fired read identically in the file, which is why the measured failure
// could not be attributed without re-reading provider logs. So one line, with the

//     ([Agent.checkpointRound]);
//   - the CEILING, when an answer has cost more than handing it over would have
//     and the harness has stopped reading ([Agent.checkpointCeiling]).
//
// BOTH OF THEM ARE THIS FILE NOW. The race was the third and is not any more: a
// read of a REQUEST nobody has worked on yet was measured converting turns whose
// work was small, so what it does instead is pull this file's first mark forward
// (route_judge.go's [Agent.routeTriage]). Its verdict still arrives here, on the
// meter, because the breadth and the done-condition it wrote are about this work.
//
// The caller brings the line the person reads, a verdict carrying whatever any
// earlier reading knew, and the sketch if a mark drew one. What this adds is the
// five things that are the same however the decision arrived: the dowry, the
// parts at the head of it, the task, the gap, and a turn sealed with the
// transcript left in a state the next turn can open on.
//
// AND IT CAN DECLINE, ON A CLAIM NO READING CONTRADICTS, ONCE PER REQUEST.
//
// The ground is the one no clock can see for itself: the model answering the
// dowry ask with [checkpointNothingLeft]. Every clock here decides on evidence
// that is old by the time it is spent — a counter of rounds already finished, a
// sketch drawn a step ago — and the model holding the findings is the only reader
// that knows whether it finished the work thirty seconds ago.
//
// BUT IT IS ALSO THE MODEL BEING INTERRUPTED, and a running model mid-grind
// answering "everything is done" is that model grading its own work at the exact
// moment it has a reason to. It was measured: a turn declared nothing was left at
// the ceiling, the handover was dropped on its say-so, and it then ground on for
// twenty more rounds with nobody watching — the failure this whole file exists to
// prevent, let through by the one door built to be kind to it.
//
// SO THE CLAIM IS WEIGHED AGAINST WHAT CONTRADICTS IT AND NOT AGAINST WHAT
// AGREES WITH IT. That is the correction the frozen revision cells forced: the
// declaration used to need the mark's reader to have drawn `(done)` at the same
// moment, and a reader that failed, was never reached, or drew a shape with no
// parts in it was spent as though it had said work was left. It had said
// nothing. Three measured cells ended with a finished request handed to a cold
// worker on the person's original sentence for want of a corroboration nobody
// was in a position to give.
//
// WHAT REFUSES A CLAIM IS A DRAWING WITH INDEPENDENT PARTS IN IT
// ([checkpointSketch.split]) — a reader stating positively that work remains —
// and nothing else. THE MARK'S OWN SPLIT THEREFORE STILL CANNOT BE DROPPED, and
// it needs no rule of its own to say so: that road is only entered on a drawing
// that says exactly this.
//
// AND THE MODEL GRADING ITSELF IS BOUNDED BY THE TURN'S OWN BUDGET. One claim is
// believed per request, whether or not a reader agreed with it
// ([checkpointMeter.believeDone]); a turn that then does [checkpointPrice] more
// rounds of real work has disproved it, and the ceiling is armed to come back and
// meet it with the claim spent. A person who types a NEW direction has changed
// the request, so the next claim is about that one and is believed on its own
// terms. When the drop is granted, NOTHING HAPPENS: no task, no line, no gap
// spent, no turn sealed — the turn carries on and its own answer stands, which is
// the honest outcome for a turn that was already finishing. When it is refused,
// the work moves on the person's own sentence, because a continuation that
// answered with the token wrote no instruction to hand anybody. That is the same
// fallback a dowry of machine markup gets, for the same reason: a task that could
// not start at all would be the guarantee broken.
//
// THE PERSON'S OWN WORDS ARE READ FIRST AND ARE NEVER WRITTEN BY ANYBODY. They
// ride the spec's request, verbatim, exactly as they do on every other door into
// the graph, and [composeBrief] prints them above the work under the rule that
// says where the two read differently theirs are what was asked for
// (task_brief.go).
//
// AND THE GOAL IS THE DOWRY, UNDER THE SKETCH. The model that has just spent the
// turn is the only reader in the building holding what the turn found out; the
// sketch above it is the shape a second reader drew of what is left. A goal
// written before the turn began — the race's own, from the request alone — would
// be the one thing on the table that knows least, which is why it is dropped
// where the other two fields of that verdict are kept.

	// THE FLOOR IS THE ONE RUNG THE REDUCTION CANNOT REACH. The two above it were
	// written by models and are blanked when they assign work this conversation is
	// holding; the floor is the PERSON'S OWN SENTENCE, and nobody on this road may
	// edit that. But the sentence that opened the measured incident was itself
	// coordination — "land everything once the other two report" — so a ladder that
	// had blanked both upper rungs came to rest on it and started a worker on the
	// very duty the reduction had just taken away. That is the bug reproducing
	// through the last door.
	//
	// SO THE ANSWER IS NOT TO EDIT IT, IT IS TO DECLINE. There is nothing here
	// anybody else could be given, which is a different fact from having nothing
	// written down at all ([checkpointCeilingNoBrief]) and is spelled apart from it:
	// one is a road that could not write a page, this is a road that wrote one and
	// found it was somebody else's already.
	//
	// AND THE WORK IS NOT LOST, BECAUSE NOTHING TOOK IT. The turn carries on, the
	// model that was doing the work still holds it, and what stayed is in the file
	// beside the drawing it came out of (sessionfile.go's [journalMark]'s `kept`).
	//
	// SO NOTHING IS WRITTEN INTO THE TRANSCRIPT HERE, and that is the difference
	// between this ending and the moved one at the bottom of this function. That
	// record exists because a MOVED turn is SEALED with the person's request
	// unanswered and the next turn would open on it; a turn that carries on is not
	// sealed, and an assistant message the model did not write appearing in the
	// middle of its own context is a thing this file has never done. The two other
	// non-moving endings ([checkpointCeilingNothing], [checkpointCeilingNoBrief])
	// record nothing for the same reason.
	//
	// AND THE TURN IS NOT ENDED EITHER, which is the same answer `dropped:no-brief`
	// gives and is not a gap to be closed here: what bounds a turn that has passed
	// its ceiling is the carried-on counter, and ENDING one is its own road (#513).
	//
	// IT FIRES ON THE WHOLE ENVELOPE THE WORKER WILL RECEIVE. The sketch heads the
	// chosen rung only after the ladder has been walked, and launchRouteTask adds
	// the person's request and fallback done-condition after that. Reading the raw
	// rung alone leaves three later doors through which held work can return. They
	// are composed here first and read by the same ledger rule as every rung.
	//
	// ── AND THE READING OF THE GOAL IS NOT WHAT CLOSES THE FLOOR ──
	//
	// A DRAWING THIS HARNESS HAD TO TAKE APART IS NOT A DRAWING A BARE SENTENCE CAN
	// STAND IN FOR. `namesHeldWork` reads a number beside the noun or a name quoted
	// whole, and the sentence that opened the measured incident was neither — "land
	// everything once the other two report" refers to two pieces without naming
	// either. A gate resting on that reading alone would be a gate the incident
	// itself walks through, so the second half of this rests on a FACT the harness
	// already holds: the drawing had to be divided at all.
	//
	// THE ASK IS THE LEAST SPECIFIC DOCUMENT ON THE TABLE. It is the person's whole
	// sentence, typed before any of this happened and never written for a worker;
	// when the drawing made out of that same turn had to be split into what can go
	// and what cannot, the sentence is BY CONSTRUCTION about the mixture — it is the
	// one document on the road that could not have distinguished the halves, because
	// it predates the reading that found them.
	//
	// SO THIS NARROWLY OVERRIDES "A BLIND WORKER BEATS A STALLED CHAT". That law
	// stands everywhere else on this road and is why the ask is a rung at all; here,
	// and only here, a worker opening on the bare ask would be opening on the very
	// mixture the reduction exists to prevent, and a blind worker does not beat a
	// duty nobody can discharge.
	//
	// AND THE PRICE IS SAID PLAINLY: where BOTH model rungs failed on provider
	// faults and the person's sentence happened to be self-contained after all, a
	// handover that would have been fine is dropped and the turn carries on. That is
	// the direction this errs in, deliberately, and it costs a conversation some

	// parts exist only if the road inside the task admits them.

//
// A handover SEALS A TURN. Every other way a turn ends under a steward passes
// through [Agent.checkpointReopen], which reads what is left and asks the
// principal what to do about it; this road asked nobody anything. Three
// unattended cells (one model, `--yolo`, a fifteen-minute wall) each handed
// their only turn to a task inside two minutes, and from that moment on the only
// thing that could have ended the run was a landing waking the head — which
// woke a turn that handed over again, and again, until the wall. Each cell
// finished its work, was green on the tree, and still ran to the wall with its
// top task reading `needs you` (#513).
//
// ── SO EVERY HANDOVER ROAD IS READ, AND ONE THING BOUNDS WHAT THE READING DOES ─
//
// A TURN IS NOT ENDED OVER RESULTS ITS MODEL HAS NOT READ. This road is usually
// reached at a step boundary, with a batch's results in the transcript and the
// model yet to say a word about them, and "the ask is finished" is not a claim
// anybody may make over the top of that — the results may hold the failure that
// answers it. So DONE IS NEVER AN ENDING HERE, and it is structural rather than
// guarded: the only verb this function acts on is the stop. The ask being
// finished is decided at the next stopped turn, where the model HAS read them
// and [Agent.checkpointReopen] already asks ([Agent.decideHandover] states what
// that costs).
//
// THAT LAW IS ABOUT DONE AND NOTHING ELSE, which is why the READING happens on
// every road whatever the model last did. A ceiling can only carry on or stop,
// and a ceiling that skipped the reading because the last thing in the
// transcript was a batch is a ceiling deciding an ending with the one opinion
// that matters left unasked — measured at round 40 of the attrs cell, where the
// handover the session had asked for one second earlier was thrown away (#513).
// Where a reading has ALREADY been taken for this ending it is handed down
// rather than taken again (see the `taken` argument).
//
// WHAT THE READING BUYS IS THE STOP AND THE OVERRULE. The stop: a run whose
// budget has gone, or whose guard has fired, or that is about to write down what
// it wrote down last time, ends here with its reason instead of paying for a
// handover and a task nobody will read. The overrule: a goal owner that says the
// ask is not finished is the one reader the two-minds decline may not talk over
// ([Agent.handOverRunningTurn]).
//
// AND THE READING AND THE SEAL ARE ONE STEP, taken without letting go of the
// graph's lock in between ([Agent.sealTurnWithNothingMoving]): a task admitted
// between the two — by a landing, by another window — is work this session has
// that the reading did not, and a turn sealed over it would be an ending declared
// across live work. So a stop over work that is moving becomes the carry-on it
// actually is, the work moves onto a task as it always did, and the goal owner
// says the same thing again at the next ending. THE ONE EXCEPTION IS THE
// BUDGET'S OWN STOP ([Decision.Spent]): a run that has spent its hours cannot buy
// the wait, so it seals over the moving work and says out loud that it did.
//
// AND A PERSON'S SESSION NEVER REACHES ANY OF IT. [Agent.steward] is the gate,
// so an attended turn hands over precisely as it always has and nothing new is
// spent, said or written down on its behalf.
//
// THE TURN IS SEALED HERE, because the callers read `moved` as "the turn is
// over" and return out of the loop without sealing (loop.go). The note is
// recorded as the turn's last words for [Agent.handOverRunningTurn]'s own
// reason: the next turn would otherwise open on a batch of tool results with

// checkpointBrief is the DRAFT of the dowry: what this turn found out, written
// down by the one reader that holds it.
//
// ── IT IS A DRAFT NOW AND IT USED TO BE THE DOCUMENT ──
//
// Everything below about WHY it is asked of the running model is unchanged and
// still true: this model is the only one in the building that knows what the turn
// found out. What changed is what happens to the answer. It used to become the
// worker's brief with two structural tests in front of it — the remains contract
// and [briefIsProse] — and a measured run walked straight between them: 5,882
// characters, 85 clauses of which 39 distinct, 62% one six-sentence loop, and a
// cold worker was started on it. So this hands a DRAFT to [Agent.writeHandoff]
// and the mastermind there writes what the worker actually opens on.
//
// AND WHAT IT REPORTS ON FAILURE CHANGED WITH IT. It used to answer the person's
// own ask when the draft was unusable, which made a bare sentence the SECOND best
// document on the table. It now answers the empty string, because the second best
// document is the one the writer below composes out of the digest, and the bare
// ask is what is left when even that cannot be had.
//
// ── WHY THE MODEL'S OWN CONTINUATION AND NOT A SUMMARISER ──
//
// There is no summariser. Compaction used to pay one and does not any more —
// "a pass is a rearrangement of text this session already has", loop.go's
// [Agent.compact] says, and it says why: the prose was expensive at the worst
// moment and lossy by construction. What replaced it is the state card, which is
// maintained by the POST-TURN extractor (card.go) and therefore holds the
// conversation as it stood before this turn began — every finding this turn made
// is exactly what it does not have. A brief written from it would hand the worker
// the conversation's history and none of its work.
//
// The shaper (task_shape.go) is the other candidate and reads the REQUEST alone,
// which is the same loss by a different road. The mark's own sidecar is not a
// candidate either: it drew a SHAPE, in one line, which is exactly the thing a
// worker cannot work from on its own.
//
// So it is asked of the one reader that actually holds the findings: the model
// that has just spent the turn. One more request, on the turn's own model and the
// turn's own transcript, and then the turn is over.
//
// ── AND IT IS ASKED WITH NO BELT ──
//
// No [ai.WithTools], which is the whole safety of asking a model that has just
// ground through the ceiling to do one more thing: with no hand to reach for, the
// only answer it can give is the document.
//
// AND NO BELT IS NOT THE SAME FACT AS NO TOOL GRAMMAR, which is the thing this
// was measured being wrong about. An omitted tools array takes the hand away; it
// does not take away the special tokens the model's own chat template is built
// around, and it does nothing about a transcript in which every previous turn
// called a tool. On deepseek this request came back as the raw tool-call sentinel
// and nothing else. So the safety of the shape is real but partial, and the part
// it cannot cover is covered by reading the answer instead.
//
// ── AND IT CANNOT LOSE THE ASK ──
//
// Because the ask does not go through it. The person's words ride the spec's
// request verbatim (see [Agent.handOverRunningTurn]); this writes the brief and
// nothing else, and when it fails — a provider fault, an interrupt, an empty
// reply — the brief falls back to their words, which is [unshaped]'s answer to
// the same failure at the typed door. A task started on the person's own sentence
// is a task that lost the dowry; a task that could not start at all would be the
// guarantee broken.
//
// ── AND IT READS WHAT CAME BACK ──
//
// Two answers to this ask are not briefs, and both were measured on real turns:
//
//   - MACHINE MARKUP, for the reason above. It is refused exactly as a provider
//     fault is refused — the person's words stand alone as the brief — because a
//     document nobody can read is worth what no document is worth. The test is
//     STRUCTURAL ([briefIsProse]) rather than a list of sentinels: an instruction
//     is words with spaces between them whoever wrote it, and a rule spelled in
//     one provider's special tokens is a rule that is wrong on the next provider.
//   - NOTHING LEFT TO DO, which is not a failure at all. It is the remains
//     contract answered ([checkpointNothingLeft]), and it drops the handover
//     rather than writing a brief.
//
// So it reports the brief AND whether there is anything to hand over, which are
// two facts rather than one: falling back to the person's ask and dropping the
// handover are opposite answers to opposite failures.

// that answers this kind of question at all ([Agent.readMark]).
//
// Asking one model to be both was the shipping arrangement and it was measured
// failing in the way a tired model fails: it wrote until it hit its cap, and what
// it wrote past the point of having anything to say was the same six sentences
// over and over. Asking the mastermind ALONE would lose the findings, which is

// a document with a hole in it.
//
// ── AND IT IS READ EXACTLY AS THE DRAFT IS ──
//
// Prose and not a loop, on the same two structural tests, because a mastermind
// asked to write two thousand tokens can run out of things to say too. A
// degenerate answer buys ONE regeneration ([checkpointBriefTries]) and then this
// gives up and answers "", which drops the caller onto the draft and then onto
