// The memo is one person saying they are done being asked about a tool. Two
// things it was quietly answering that nobody ever put to them: the critical
// shapes, and the calls that leave this machine in their name. Both of those
// answer PROMPT rather than deny (internal/approval), so a memo consulted ahead
// of them swallowed them whole — one approved `git status` bought silence for
// `rm -rf /` for the rest of the session.

// step, so the answers to the earlier ones are in hand before the later ones
// are judged.
