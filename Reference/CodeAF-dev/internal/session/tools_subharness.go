// THE PROGRAMS, PUT IN THE MODEL'S HANDS — BEHIND A CARD.
//
// A subharness is a saved PROGRAM for a shape of work this project does again
// and again: typed input, typed output, its own tools, its own bounds
// (docs/SUBHARNESS-PRD.md). The whole value of having one is that it gets USED,
// and the way a thing on a list stops being used is that nobody remembers the
// list exists. So the conversation itself offers one when the work in front of
// it is that shape — which is the same argument harness.go makes about the turn
// matching a saved harness, made one layer up where the judgement can be good.
//
// THE DECIDING IS THE MODEL'S, exactly as tools_harness.go's header argues at
// length. A regular expression cannot tell "triage this flaky test" from "we
// should write something that triages flaky tests one day", and a table lookup
// that tried would be wrong on somebody's turn. A tool costs nothing until the
// model reaches for it, so the judgement is made once, by the thing in this
// program that can make it, with the whole conversation in front of it.
//
// ── AND THEN IT IS GATED TWICE MORE, BECAUSE A PROPOSAL IS NOT A LAUNCH ──
//
// THE LEXICAL GATE. Phase 1 matches by CUES and by NAME and by nothing else: the
// program's own trigger vocabulary, appearing in what has actually been said. It
// is deliberately dull — no index, no scores, no thresholds machinery, all of
// which is Phase 2 — and its only job is to make the confidence rule real:
// a match raises the card, and a weak match raises NOTHING. Silence over noise.
// A conversation that has to swat away a suggestion is worse off than one that
// never got it.
//
// THE CARD. Nothing runs because chat proposed it. The person is shown the
// program, chat's reason, and the intake card with the form already filled from
// this conversation — and what they answer is what happens. THERE IS NO CLOCK
// THAT APPROVES: propose_task's countdown ends in a yes because the countdown is
// a window to redirect ordinary work, and this one may not, because "never
// silent auto-execution" is the law this whole path is built around (PRD §9).
// The clock that does exist ends in NOTHING RUNNING, and it exists only because
// a tool that blocks without a bound of its own is the one way left to break the
// turn's batch law (loop.go's runToolsWarm).
//
// ── THE THREE VERBS ARE DISJOINT ──
//
// propose_subharness runs a program that ALREADY EXISTS for this exact shape.
// build_harness designs a new repeatable recipe. propose_task hands out ordinary
// work — one self-contained piece of it, or a wide job with `wide` set, which
// starts ONE worker that hands the parts out once it has opened the material. A
// model that has two of the three reaches for the wrong one, which is why each
// description names the other two.
//
// THERE WERE FOUR, and the fourth was run_adaptive. It is off the belt entirely
// (tools_harness.go), and so is every other way in: a chat turn may not open a
// planned graph any more, by any hand and by any words (loop.go), so no
// description here may send the model at one.

A subharness is a named procedure somebody kept — it takes typed input, produces a typed answer, uses only the tools it declared, and runs beside this conversation as its own task with a room, a number and a stop. Call list_subharnesses first: you can only propose one that exists, by its exact name. PROPOSE ONLY WHEN THE WORK IN FRONT OF YOU IS THAT SHAPE — the program's purpose is what the person is actually asking for, not merely adjacent to it. If you are reaching, say nothing: a wrong offer costs the person a decision they did not want to make, and nothing is lost by leaving it, because they can always ask. The reason is the whole of what they read before deciding, so write what MATCHED in their own terms — \"the brief and a failing test name are both here\" — and not a description of the program, which they can see. Nothing runs when you call this. The person is shown the program, your reason, and its form with whatever this conversation already answers already filled in; they change what is wrong, fill what is missing, and confirm — or they do not, and nothing happens. You are told which. Use it for work a saved program does; use build_harness to DESIGN a program for a shape that has none, and propose_task for ordinary work — one self-contained piece of it, or a wide job with `wide` set, which starts one worker that hands the parts out once it has opened the material."
