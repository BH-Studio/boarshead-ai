// A FOLDER LANDING DOES NOT WRITE OVER THE PERSON'S OWN EDIT (issue #258).
//
// The claim under test is one sentence: what a mirror family lays back over
// somebody's folder is measured against what that folder held when the copy was
// made, and a file they changed themselves in between is named rather than
// overwritten. So these drive the real doors — the same [prepareTaskTreeOn] a
// running node calls, the one [landHome] every landing road goes through, and a
// person's own `accept` hours later — and assert both halves of every case: what
// the folder holds afterwards, and what the person is told.
