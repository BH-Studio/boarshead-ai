// sentence about a real failure rather than about a service that was never a
// served one.

// It is asserted against the REGISTRY ITSELF rather than a fake, because the one
// way the two can drift is a service added on one side: a browser account with no
// family that does not serve its own tools would be asked what it brings and
// would answer with an error, and the person would read that a healthy account
// was broken. This test is where that lands instead.
