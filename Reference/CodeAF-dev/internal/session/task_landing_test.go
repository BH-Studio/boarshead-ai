// task_landing_test.go is written from two measured defects, both of them a
// task that SETTLED AS DONE over something nobody could use.
//
// The first: a node ran its test suite, the suite needed a virtualenv, and the
// landing swept the virtualenv onto the person's branch — twenty-six hunks of
// vendored noise and not one line of the change it was briefed for. A second
// run committed three thousand files of a `.venv_test` the same way. Both were
// `git add -A` calling a directory a deliverable.
//
// The second: a node's branch would not merge, and the node landed anyway. The
// patch was an unresolved merge and the report said as much, while the card
// read finished.
//
// Everything below is one repository in a temp directory and the real git
// underneath it, because both defects were about what git was actually asked to
// do rather than about anything a fake could have modelled.

// A LANDING BRINGS HOME WHAT THE WORKER WROTE. The two files its own hands made
