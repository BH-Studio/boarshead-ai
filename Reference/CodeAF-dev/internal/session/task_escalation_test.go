// THE THIRD MOMENT: work handed over from INSIDE the answer that began it.
//
// Chat could already escalate before the work started — the route judge reading
// a tool-less turn (route_judge.go), and a model proposing a task on the first
// step of a turn. Neither of those covers the moment the material reveals its
// own size: several calls in, with the findings in hand. Nothing here is a new
// road. The teaching lives in prompts/system.md, the findings ride in the brief
// propose_task already takes, and the only thing the code adds is the one line a
// person reads when it happens ([taskEscalationNote]).
//
// So these tests pin the three things that could quietly stop being true: that
// the prompt still teaches the PRINCIPLE rather than a rule, that a
// findings-rich brief reaches the worker whole, and that the line is that line.
