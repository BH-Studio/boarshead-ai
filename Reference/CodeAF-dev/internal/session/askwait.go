// THE PARKED ASK, AND THE THREE WAYS ONE ENDS.
//
// `ask` is the only tool on the belt that stops the work and waits for a person
// (tools_ask.go). While it waits, the turn is parked: no request is out, no
// boundary is coming, and the whole of what will start the work again is
// somebody at a keyboard. That wait used to be a bare `map[uint64]chan Answer`
// on the agent, parked in one file, delivered to in a second, counted in a
// third and enumerated in a fourth — four places that each knew part of the rule
// and none of which held it.
//
// SO IT IS ONE TYPE WITH THE RULE IN IT, and the rule is that A PARKED ASK ENDS
// EXACTLY THREE WAYS:
//
//	ANSWERED    the person chose ([askedOfThePerson.answerLocked], from the one
//	            resolver every surface calls). The lane reads an [Answer].
//	TALKED PAST the person said something else instead
//	            ([askedOfThePerson.talkedPastLocked], from the splice —
//	            steerquestion.go says what was measured). The lane reads a closed
//	            channel, which is the one shape that cannot be mistaken for a
//	            choice they made.
//	LET GO      the lane itself stopped waiting ([askedOfThePerson.letGoLocked]):
//	            the turn was stopped, or the question was never drawn at all.
//
// There is no fourth, and nothing outside this file may reach the channels.
//
// ── AND AN ANSWERED QUESTION IS KEPT, BECAUSE IT CAN BE CHANGED ──
//
// A decision the person made is still theirs afterwards: while its receipt is on
// screen they may answer it again (`c change`, tui3's questionchange.go), and a
// permission they widened may be handed back whole (`u undo`). So the entry does
// not leave this book when it is answered — [askOpen.settled] is filled in and
// the entry stays, which is the only way the revision can be rendered against
// what was actually asked and say what it replaced. It leaves when the turn
// retires it, when the call that asked is abandoned, or with the session.
//
// THE OWNERSHIP MOVES DOWN ONE FIELD WITH IT. `THE ENTRY IS THE OWNERSHIP` holds
// for the three endings that take the entry out of the map; the answer claims
// the WAIT instead ([askedOfThePerson.answerLocked] takes `open.wait` and leaves
// nil behind), which is the same primitive one field lower and is what
// [askedOfThePerson.askedBackLocked] already did.
//
// ── AND A QUESTION CAN OUTLIVE THE CALL THAT ASKED IT ──
//
// Two shapes do it: a RATIFY, which nothing waits on ([AskKind.Waits]), and a
// question the person ASKED BACK on, which stays open while the model answers
// them. Both are still open questions — still drawn, still answerable in any
// window, still coming down through the one door — and neither has anything
// parked on it, so the entry below holds a nil wait and the answer reaches the
// model as a message instead ([Agent.answerAsk]).
//
// That is why this book holds an [askOpen] and not a bare channel. The question
// itself, the asker's own names for its answers and the way to take it back down
// have to survive the call, or a question with nobody parked on it is one
// nothing in this engine can describe, deliver to, or withdraw.
//
// ── THE ENTRY IS THE OWNERSHIP ──
//
// Every road here removes the id from the map under a.mu BEFORE it touches that
// id's channel, so at most one road can ever hold it. That is what makes closing
// a channel safe rather than a send-on-closed waiting to happen, and it is why
// the three endings can be written as three verbs instead of one flag every
// caller has to get right. A second answer to an already-ended ask finds
// nothing and says so, which is what every caller already wanted.
//
// ── AND THE DELIVERY NEVER BLOCKS ──
//
// The channel is buffered to one and at most one thing is ever put on it,
// because the id is gone from the map before the put. So the send happens with
// a.mu held, like everything else here, without the unlock-and-hope the raw map
// needed around it.

// nothing.
