// ONE MOVE, WHEN THE PROVIDER RATHER THAN THE WORK FAILED.
//
// A node whose worker died because nothing serving its model would answer has
// learned nothing about the brief, and the worktree it prepared is the part that
// was expensive. So it runs again, once, on the next model in the chain — and
// the row, the card and the report all say which two models were involved.
