// A RUN'S WORKING COPY IS WRITTEN DOWN, OR IT CANNOT BE RESUMED.
//
// THE DIRECTORY IS DERIVED AND THE BRANCH IS NOT. That asymmetry is the whole
// reason this file exists, and a reader who believes both are reconstructible
// will delete it. A run's directory is a pure function of the conversation's
// folder and the run's own number ([taskOwnFolder]), so any process can work it
// out again. Its branch is minted with a random suffix at the moment the copy
// is cut ([cutTaskWorktree]), and nothing before this file wrote it anywhere.
//
// SO THE ROAD THAT MAKES A COPY MUST NEVER BE ASKED FOR ONE TWICE. It carves
// the directory it is handed, and it is documented as safe to do so precisely
// because the only thing that can be sitting at a run's path is that run's own
// wreckage. Call it again to "resume" a run and it clears out the directory
// holding every step of the work, cuts a fresh branch off a new random name,
// and hands back something that looks perfectly healthy. Nobody would see it
// until it was their work.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE GIVES INSTEAD is a record written when the run starts and a
// reader that ADOPTS what it names. The reader refuses rather than repairs.
