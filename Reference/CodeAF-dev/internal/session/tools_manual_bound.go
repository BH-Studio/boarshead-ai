// Bounding the manual's page lookup.
//
// Every other read on the belt is bounded: a file comes back at 2000 lines or
// 50KB and says how to ask for the next part. A named manual page was the one
// read with no ceiling at all, and the pages it can return are larger than the
// files — the biggest is 205 KB, four times what the read tool will hand over
// — so a single lookup could spend a conversation's whole context on one page
// that mentioned the word the model was after. The tool's own refusals made
// that likelier, because they hand the model the list of page names and a name
// is exactly what invites the unbounded call.
//
// So a page is bounded by the SAME NUMBER a file read quotes, and the rest of
// it is addressable rather than lost: the cut says what it cut and lists that
// page's headings, and one of those headings comes back whole.

	// nothing until a page actually has that many headings. Half a page is room
	// for every heading of the longest page there is, twice over — tasks is
	// that page, and its 138 headings come to a little under 13,000 bytes —
	// so the list is whole in practice and still cannot become the flood it
