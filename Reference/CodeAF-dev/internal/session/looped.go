// Loop detection: the nudge for a turn going in circles.
//
// A model that is stuck does not stop — it repeats. The same grep with the same
// pattern, four times. The same build, failing the same way, six times. Nothing
// in the loop (loop.go) notices, because every individual step is legal: a tool
// was called, a result came back, the model asked again. The turn ends when the
// model runs out of ideas or when the person interrupts, and the second is what
// actually happens.
//
// ── WHAT IS WATCHED ──
//
// Four signals, per turn, over a sliding window of the last dozen calls:
//
//   - THE SAME CALL THREE TIMES IN A ROW. Consecutive, because a call repeated
//     with other work between the repeats is usually a person's transcript being
//     re-read, not a loop. Identity is the tool name and its arguments — a read
//     of two different files is two different calls.
//   - THE SAME ERROR THREE TIMES IN THE TURN. Total rather than consecutive, and
//     across tools rather than per tool, because this is the shape a real loop
//     takes: the model varies the call, the failure does not move.
//   - SILENT TOOL BATCHES IN A ROW. A reasoning model can keep re-deriving a
//     plan that vanishes at every step boundary while every individual call
//     remains distinct. The notes arrive after six batches and after twelve, the
//     second stronger than the first, and progress resets the ladder.
//     SILENCE IS HYGIENE AND NOT STUCKNESS, so its notes are the only ones that
//     cannot end a turn through the hand-off below. THE SECOND RUNG IS WHERE THE
//     ADVICE STOPS BEING ADVICE: from there the loop withholds a submission that
//     carries only tool calls until a note lands, and ends the turn on its own
//     honest line if the model will not write one (processrule.go).
//   - ROUNDS THAT READ NOTHING NEW. Distinct command strings can ask the same
//     question with slightly different words, so the ledger rather than the
//     signature decides whether the answers added anything. Five consecutive
//     rounds whose every result has no fresh line name that fact directly.
//   - AND, FASTER THAN EITHER: THE SAME CALL REFUSED FOR ITS ARGUMENTS TWICE.
//
// ── THE ARGUMENT-REFUSAL RULE, AND WHY IT IS TWO AND NOT THREE ──
//
// An argument refusal is the one failure that arrives with its own cure. A tool
// that answers "Invalid arguments: limit takes a whole number: send
// {"limit":10}, not 10.0" has already told the model the corrected call, so a
// SECOND identical call proves the model did not read it — no further evidence
// is going to arrive, and every repeat after that is spend. So an identical call
// whose result is an argument refusal is named at TWO, and the note carries the
// tool's own repair sentence rather than the harness's advice to think again:
// there is nothing to rethink, there is a call to correct.
//
// The measurement that set this: a model sent `tasks {"limit":10.0}` eleven
// times in one turn, and the counts that reached the person were nine and
// eleven — the ordinary ladder, arriving eight calls after the answer was known.
// Everything that is NOT an argument refusal keeps the old counts, because
// nothing about those is known in advance.
//
// AND NOTHING THE HARNESS ITSELF ANSWERED IS WATCHED AT ALL. A hand that was
// withdrawn (withdrawn.go) and a door that refused the call never reached the
// world: the failure was written on this side of the wall, and a repetition of
// it is the harness's doing, not the model's. Those results are skipped before
// any rule sees them — the measured cost of not doing so is three [stuck]
// notes scolding a worker for retrying a tool the harness had just taken away.
//
// ── WHAT A NUDGE IS ──
//
// A note in the transcript, in the lane a person's steering rides (agent.go's
// enqueueSteering): plain user-role text, drained at the next step boundary,
// journaled like anything else the model was told. It is deliberately NOT a
// provider error and not a tool failure — the model is not being punished, it is
// being told what it has been doing, which is the one fact it cannot see.
//
// ONE NUDGE PER SIGNATURE, AND THEN HYSTERESIS. A loop that continues
// immediately after being named does not earn a second identical note; a second,
// different loop in the same turn does. The whole watch resets per turn, because
// a turn is where a person's attention resets too.
//
// ── THE HYSTERESIS LAW ──
//
// Forward progress is accepted IMMEDIATELY; backward movement needs REPEATED
// evidence (PMCoder's phase hysteresis, https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.06811 — the
// mechanism that stops a planner thrashing between phases on one noisy signal).
// Here the two directions are:
//
//   - FORWARD is a successful call this turn has not already been nudged about.
//     One of those kills the backward case outright: every streak resets, and a
//     model that was three repetitions deep starts again from nothing. No
//     confirmation, no decay, no half-credit — the evidence that the turn is
//     working is the turn working.
//   - BACKWARD is a signature that was already named repeating AGAIN. It takes
//     [loopHysteresis] more of them to advance the ladder, not one. The
//     asymmetry is the whole mechanism: the harness is quick to believe the turn
//     is fine and slow to escalate against it, because escalating costs the
//     person's attention and being wrong about progress costs nothing.
//
// ── AND THEN THE HAND-OFF, WHICH SILENCE HAS NO PART IN ──
//
// Past two nudges the notes have stopped working, and a third one is the harness
// talking to itself. The third signal therefore ends the turn through the same
// checkpoint hand-off that governs any other overlong turn. When that road is
// unavailable — inside a task, without a consent surface, or when no brief can
// be carried — the turn still ends and says plainly that its remains were left.
//
// FOUR RULES CAN SPEND THAT COUNT, AND SILENCE IS NOT ONE OF THEM: identity, the
// repeated error, the argument refusal, and the round that read nothing new.
// Each of those is a claim that the turn is not moving. Silence is a claim about
// the RECORD — that reasoning is being lost between steps — and a turn can be
// entirely silent while committing, pushing and landing real work.
//
// The measured case: a worker's last six calls before it was stopped were
// `commit-tree`, `write-tree`, a second commit, a ref update, a log and a
// cleanup — all distinct, all succeeding, with three visible notes written in
// the minute before. Two early silence notes plus one late one added up to a
// hand-off, and the row it left said the turn "went in circles" when the turn
// had been working the whole time. So a silent note keeps its rung and its
// wording and books nothing, and no rung of it promises a hand-off it cannot
// make.
//
// AND MATERIAL PROGRESS GIVES THE COUNT BACK, ONE RUNG AT A TIME. The two
// ledgers this file keeps take different evidence, on purpose:
//
//   - THE PER-SIGNATURE STREAKS take the weak kind — any successful call this
//     turn has not been nudged about — and clear to NOTHING. They are evidence
//     about one repetition, and evidence that the turn is working destroys the
//     backward case outright. That is the hysteresis law above, unchanged.
//   - THE NUDGE COUNT takes only the strong kind: a file written, or a shell
//     command that left the tree different from how it found it — and neither of
//     them from a call this turn has already been nudged about, because a loop
//     that paid its own refund would put the ceiling out of reach. It steps DOWN
//     BY ONE rather than clearing.
//
// Both halves of that are load-bearing. VISIBLE TEXT CANNOT BUY THE COUNT BACK,
// because a model narrating its own loop is still looping — text is the cure for
// the silent ladder and for nothing else. NOR CAN THE WEAK KIND: the first two
// calls of a turn's SECOND loop are by construction calls nobody has been nudged
// about yet, so a turn-wide budget refunded by them is no budget at all.
//
// And it steps down rather than zeroing because the count is not evidence — it
// is the person's attention, already spent, and attention already spent does not
// un-spend. Zeroing would mean a turn that loops, is nudged, does one token of
// real work and loops again can never be handed over however long it runs.
// Stepping down says: forgiven quickly, and still remembered.

// person's whole worktree. Nothing in that reading is needed to compose the
// request; it is needed to decide whether to say a sentence about a loop.
//
// So the reading is taken with [offpath.Take] and settled with a bound
// ([worktreeDirtJoin]). On a repository git can answer inside that bound —
// which is every ordinary project — the answer is exactly what it always was.
// On one it cannot, the reading is NOT thrown away and NOT waited on: it stays
// in flight beside the model round trip that follows, and the next batch takes
