// The assignment: what a running task is working towards RIGHT NOW, which is
// not always what it was handed at admission.
//
// A person walks into a running task's room and says "CSV instead of JSON".
// Until this file existed that sentence reached the worker as talk and nothing
// else: `spec.brief` and `spec.acceptance` were frozen at admission, the
// auditor graded the finished work against the frozen text, and the worker's
// own prompt told it that a direction "does not replace your brief or your
// done-condition". So the harness asked the worker to obey a correction and
// then checked it for having obeyed one. That is the contradiction this file
// removes, and it removes it in the one way that keeps verification meaningful:
// the objective moves only with AUTHORITY, and it moves as a versioned,
// attributed, recorded revision that every later reader sees the same way.
//
// ── WHAT IS FROZEN AND WHAT MOVES ──
//
// The admitted spec never changes. `spec.request` is the person's own words,
// `spec.brief` is the contract the conversation groomed, `spec.acceptance` is
// what the work was originally to be judged by, and all three stay byte for
// byte what they were — so a page reopened tomorrow, a checkpoint written by an
// older build, and the record of what was actually agreed all still read true.
//
// What moves is an OVERLAY on top of them: an effective deliverable, an
// effective acceptance, and a block of revisions carrying the person's verbatim
// words. [taskAssignment.effective] folds the two into one snapshot, and the
// three readers that must never disagree — the worker's document, the check's
// harvest, the auditor's packet — all take that one snapshot.
//
// ── AUTHORITY IS NOT DELEGABLE ──
//
// A revision must cite a DIRECTION: one recorded message, with an id, from
// somebody who may revise this work. Only [directionFromPerson] may, and who
// that is comes from the delivery seam's own label rather than from this file's
// guess — [directionOf] is the single mapping, and every origin but the person's
// own door maps to the reading that grants nothing (mailbox.go). The model's
// coordination into a node (`tasks … say`, [Agent.relayToTask]) is recorded and
// readable and refused as a basis for revision: an agent that could revise the
// work it is graded on would be marking its own homework, and a descendant
// phrasing a request as an instruction must not thereby acquire authority.
//
// A worker cannot mint a direction either: the only doors that record one are
// the person's own ([Agent.SteerTask], [Agent.ContinueTask]). The worker's tool
// (assignment_tool.go) may only APPLY one that already exists, once, and the
// person's verbatim words travel with the revision it writes — so a restatement
// that has drifted from what they actually said is visible to the auditor and
// to the person, rather than being the only account left.
//
// ── DISCUSSION IS NOT DIRECTION ──
//
// Nothing here fires on its own. "Why did you do it this way?" is recorded as a
// direction receipt in `pending` and read by the worker as an ordinary message,
// and the assignment's version does not move: an answer is what that question
// wants. Moving it costs one explicit tool call by a worker that has the words
// in front of it, which is why there is no classifier model call in this file —
// the capable turn already reading the message is the reader.
//
// ── VERSION IS NOT ATTEMPT ──
//
// [taskAssignment.version] counts REVISIONS OF THE GOAL and nothing else. A
// node that is stopped, continued, repaired or run a second time after a
// provider fault is the same assignment at the same version; a node that has
// taken one accepted direction is at version 1 whether that was its first turn
// or its fortieth. The two are separate because the questions are: "what is
// this work for" and "how many times have we tried it" have different answers
// and different readers.

// It is deliberately a fact about the message rather than a permission on the

// agent's coordination call, and by the time a worker reads them the only thing
// that can still tell them apart is what was written down when they arrived.
