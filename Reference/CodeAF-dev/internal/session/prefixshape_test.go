// WHAT EACH SHAPE ACTUALLY CARRIES, AND WHERE THE BUDGET WAS NOT LOOKING.
//
// prefixbudget_test.go bounds ONE number: the widest page plus the tool block of
// the conversation door's belt. That is the right thing to ratchet and it is not
// the whole bill. Two gaps were measured on 2026-09-05:
//
//   - IT WEIGHS [widestPage] AND NOT A RENDERED ONE. The widest page has every
//     belt fact in its present case and none of the footer — no `Project` block,
//     no `Now`, no AGENTS.md — so it is neither an upper nor a lower bound on
//     what a real agent reads. A task node's page is a different page again: it
//     carries prompts/worker.md and the fan-out page on top.
//   - IT WEIGHS ONE SHAPE. A task room pays a prefix of its own on every round of
//     every step it takes, and nothing was measuring it.
//
// So this file renders each shape the way its door does and prints what it
// carries. It is a MEASUREMENT and not a second budget: one ratchet is enough,
// and a second one would be two numbers to raise. What it asserts is only the
// ordering the design rests on — a task room's fixed prefix is smaller than the
// conversation's, because the verbs a room has no use for are not on its belt
// and the sections about them are not on its page.
