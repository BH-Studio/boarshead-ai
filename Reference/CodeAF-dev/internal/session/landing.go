package session

// landing.go answers "where does this file go" for everything a session puts on
// disk that is not the journal itself — the droppings it makes for its own use,
// and the deliverables it makes for the person.
//
// It exists as one file because it is one decision. place.go says what a
// session folder CONTAINS; this says which of those directories each writer
// reaches for, and it says it once so that jobs.go, stub.go,
// tools_image.go and internal/remote cannot drift into five answers.
//
// ── DROPPINGS GO IN THE FOLDER, DELIVERABLES GO WHERE THE PERSON WILL LOOK ──
//
// A dropping — a job log, a stubbed tool result — is
// re-creatable, carries the sweep's 7-day TTL, and is never something anybody
// asked for. It belongs beside the transcript that explains what it was for, so
// that deleting a session is removing one folder (docs/CHAT-V3.md, Decision 26)
// and so that NOTHING OF OURS LIVES IN THE PERSON'S FOLDER.
//
// A deliverable is the opposite claim: somebody may want it back. An OWNED
// session's workspace is already ours to fill, so a picture lands in it like
// any other file the person's work produced. A BORROWED session's workspace is
// somebody's repository, so a picture lands in the session's own artifacts/
// instead — and the row in the global index (artifacts.go) is how it is found
// again, since nothing about the path is memorable.
//
// ── THE ZERO PLACE IS THE LEGACY LAYOUT ──
//
// Every answer below falls back to <workspace>/.codeaf/<kind>, exactly where
// a flat-layout session has always written, so the folder lands seam-first: a
// caller that has not adopted a Place keeps the behavior it had.
//
// ── A WORKER'S DROPPINGS BELONG TO ITS FAMILY, NEVER TO THE FOLDER IT BORROWED ──
//
// A Place belongs to a SESSION, and only a session has one. Every other agent
// this package runs is deliberately not a second session and carries no Place at
// all: a task node's worker (task_run.go's [Agent.newTaskAgent]), a part's
// worker under that one, an adaptive run's child
// (orchestrate.go), an auditor (task_audit.go), a standing item's probe
// (standing_run.go). That is the right decision about identity — a Place is a
// meta.json to stamp, a work/ to paint into and an id to file a transcript
// under, and a worker owns none of them.
//
// IT IS THE WRONG ANSWER ABOUT LITTER, and it was wrong for every dropping every
// worker ever made. The ladder above read the zero Place, fell to the legacy
// rung, and wrote <workspace>/.codeaf/<kind> — where <workspace> is the
// PERSON'S REPOSITORY or a worktree of it, which is the one thing the paragraph
// at the top of this file says must never happen.
//
// IT WAS MEASURED. On a SWE-Marathon run a task node's worker read a scoring
// script; the stub pass filed the result (stub.go) and, having no Place, wrote
// the whole of that script verbatim to <crate>/.codeaf/stubs/<digest>.txt —
// inside the repository being graded. The benchmark's source scan walks the
// crate, found files that were not the person's work and were not the person's
// tools, and zeroed the run. Off a benchmark it is the same fact with a quieter
// cost: everything long a worker reads is copied into a hidden directory in
// somebody's project.
//
// So a droppings home is asked of the FAMILY and not of the workspace: an agent
// with no folder of its own writes where the session that commissioned it writes
// ([Config.droppingsPlace], set at each construction seam from
// [Agent.familyPlace]). The legacy rung survives for the one caller it was ever
// meant for — a session that truly has no folder.
