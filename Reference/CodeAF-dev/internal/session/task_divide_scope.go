// SCOPE OWNERSHIP: the parts of one division may not claim the same path.
//
// THIS IS A HARD FLOOR AND NOT A SECOND OPINION. The ledger is the contract of
// what ships — [Agent.stageTaskWork] stages the ledger and nothing else — so a
// path that two parts both wrote appears in the parent's ledger twice and is
// staged once. One version wins, silently, before git is ever asked to notice a
// conflict. That is not a merge to resolve; it is work that no longer exists.
//
// So the overlap is answered where it can still be free: at admission, before
// any part is claimed, started, or paid for. The reviewer keeps its own job of
// SHARPENING boundaries (task_divide.go's [divideReviewBrief] asks it to fix the
// boundary or fold the parts together), and this stands underneath it for the
// division the reviewer approved anyway — a model that reads the parts well is
// still a model, and the failure it lets through is invisible.
//
// AND IT IS DELIBERATELY DIM. Only the exact same normalised path claimed by two
// parts collides. Two parts working in one directory, or one part owning a
// folder while another owns a file inside it, are left alone: the measured
// data-loss case is the same path written twice, and a prefix rule over prose
// read out of a brief would refuse honest divisions to catch a case nobody has
// seen. If real usage produces one, it is a change to make then.
//
// THE DIMNESS IS WHY THE CLAIM IS ONE SENTENCE AND NOT TWO. A part's brief was
// read as a claim until #281, and a brief is prose: it names the material the
// part works on, which includes everything the part must READ. Two parts told to
// read one plan and write a file each — the ordinary shape of divided work —
// were refused on the plan, and the road's own end-to-end suite worked around it
// by leaving the ground empty. The answer is not a grammar over the prose,
// which is the machinery this file already refused to build. It is to read the
// sentence that was always about the finished tree: the DONE-CONDITION.

// scopeCollisions is every path more than one part of this division claims,
// spelled the way the parts spell it and in a stable order.
//
// WHAT COUNTS AS A CLAIM is a path named in the part's DONE-CONDITION, and
// nothing named anywhere else. The done-condition is the one sentence of a part
// that describes the tree AFTER the part is finished — what somebody else could
// check without taking the worker's word for it — so it is the sentence that
// says what this part produces. The brief is context and is read for nothing
// here: what the part works on, what its author already learned, the material
// every part reads. The schema and prompts/divide.md teach exactly that, so a
// worker naming a shared input in its brief is doing what it was asked to.
//
// THE OTHER ROAD IS COVERED BY CONSTRUCTION. A part the harness drew out of a
// sketch has no done-condition of its own, so task_divide_sketch.go's
// [divisionStandInDone] writes one out of that part's scope — which means the
// scope a drawing gave a part is still read here, and a sketch that put two
// parts on one file is refused exactly as it was.
//
// [pathTokens] does the reading and [groundHolds] does the judging, exactly as
// the ground ladder does it (taskstands.go): a word only counts when it really
// lands under the family tree, which is what keeps ordinary prose — a sentence
// that happens to end in a full stop, an interpreter named in passing — from
// reading as somebody's claim.
//
// THE PATHS ARE NORMALISED BEFORE THEY ARE COMPARED, because `report.md` and
// `/…/tree/report.md` in two done-conditions are one file and a comparison on
// the words would say they were two. [resolvePath] is the same reading a shell standing in
// that directory would make, and [canonicalPath] settles the rest of the
// spelling: a file reached through a symlinked ancestor — /var and /private/var
// on a Mac — is one file, so two parts that claim it two ways are one claim.
// The refusal still quotes each part's own words.
//
// It is one pass over the parts with a set, not a comparison of every part
// against every other: a division may carry a dozen parts and each
// done-condition a dozen paths, and the honest shape of "who else claimed this"

// ── the second rule: A FAMILY-WIDE CHECK BELONGS TO THE FAMILY ────────────────
//
// A CHECK EVERY PART IS ORDERED TO RUN IS THE FAMILY'S, NOT ANY PART'S. When one
// command stands in two or more sibling done-conditions, the division is not
// admitted. Each part is asked for the check that proves its own slice, and the
// whole run is the parent's to make once, after their work is home.
//
// IT IS THE SAME SENTENCE THE OWNERSHIP RULE ABOVE MAKES ABOUT PATHS, made about
// commands: what a part is finished against describes the part, and not the
// family it belongs to. The loss it answers is different and it is not silent —
// it is measured waste. A division hands its parts out to run AT THE SAME TIME,
// each in a worktree of its own, so a done-condition copied into three parts is
// three concurrent runs of that check plus the parent's own afterwards, and every
// one of the three judges a tree that does not yet hold its siblings' files. The
// measured shape was three parts each ordered to run an eight-minute suite: four
// runs where the work needed one, and only the last of them able to be right.
//
// AND IT CLASSIFIES BY REPETITION ACROSS SIBLINGS, NEVER BY A PROGRAM NAME AND
// NEVER BY A DURATION. There is no build system named anywhere below and no
// threshold in seconds, because either would be a list to keep up to date and
// neither is the fact that matters. Two genuinely targeted checks differ in what
// they NAME — a file each, a package each — and stay two checks; a family-wide
// check is THE SAME WORDS IN EVERY PART, and being the same words in every part
// is exactly what makes it nobody's. A slow check that only one part was told to
// run is that part's own business and is left alone.

// sharedCheckCommands is every command more than one part of this division is
// ordered to run, normalised and in a stable order.
//
// THIS IS A DUPLICATE-WORK LINT, NOT EXECUTABLE VERIFICATION. The checker only
// reads typed declarations. This lint also compares done-condition clauses: real ones are plain sentences, "rank_test.go passes; go test
// ./internal/tui3/... passes", with nothing marked at all, and a reading that
// waited to be told would see no commands here on the day the waste happens.
//
// SO THE DISCRIMINATOR IS WHETHER THE CLAUSE ORDERS WORK ([ordersWork]), and
// keeping ordinary prose out of it is the whole of why this rule is safe to
// have. OVER-REFUSING A LEGITIMATE DIVISION WOULD SHUT THE ROAD ON ITS OWN BEST
// CASE, which is the same dimness the ownership rule above is built out of.

//
// SO THE FIRST TELLING REFUSES AND THE SECOND REPAIRS. A worker that can redraw
// its done-conditions is asked to, exactly as before — that is the whole of the
// first answer and none of it moved. A worker that comes back with the same
// shape has said, by doing it, that it cannot; and at that point the honest
// thing is not to say no more loudly. The division is admitted with the shared
// command TAKEN OFF EVERY PART and given to the parent.

// IT IS NEVER LEFT ON THE FIRST PART, and that is the law rather than an
// implementation choice: the whole finding is that the check is the FAMILY'S and
