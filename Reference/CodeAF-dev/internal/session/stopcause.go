// ── EVERY CANCEL SAYS WHICH DOOR IT CAME THROUGH ────────────────────────────
//
// A TURN THAT ENDS WITH NOTHING SAID IS THE WORST THING THIS PACKAGE CAN DO,
// and until this file it could do it silently. `context.CancelFunc` carries no
// account of itself: every door here — the person's stop key, another window
// taking the conversation over, a tab closing, a hosted session being retired,
// the session quitting — cancelled the turn's context in exactly the same way,
// and what came back out the other end was the string `context canceled`. The
// model-call row said that. The loop read `ctx.Err() != nil`, wrote no journal
// line and sent no event. The surface, which had usually already looked away by
// then, drew nothing.
//
// The measured case was a chat turn on 2026-09-09 that thought for 108 seconds
// at full rate and then simply stopped: no answer, no error, no note, an idle
// status line, and nobody — the person, the log, or anyone reading the
// transcript afterwards — able to say what had ended it.
//
// SO EVERY DOOR NAMES ITSELF. The turn's context is made with
// [context.WithCancelCause] and each door cancels with one of the causes below;
// [context.Cause] reads it back at the boundary, the journal writes it down,
// the model-call row carries it instead of `context canceled`, and the surface
// is given ONE sentence — the person's own words, never the machine's.
//
// AND THE CAUSE DECIDES WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. A person who pressed stop is told
// their turn stopped and nothing else; that is what they asked for. Everything
// else is machinery, and machinery that takes a reply away from somebody owes
// them an account of it.

// StopDoor is what ended a turn, in machine words. It is a small closed set on
// purpose: a door that is not on it is a door nobody can autopsy.
