// one directory, so deleting a session is removing one folder and exporting
// one is zipping one. Every path below starts as arithmetic on [Place.Dir];
// only [Place.Trees] resolves that spelling against the disk, because git
// records worktree paths after resolving symlinks. The other disk access here
// is [Meta]'s load and save, because where things live and what lives there are
// one decision made in one file.
//
// The zero Place is the LEGACY layout: every method on it answers "", and a
// caller holding one keeps deriving sidecar paths the flat way. That is what
// lets the new layout land seam-first without a flag day.
