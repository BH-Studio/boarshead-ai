// Both tests here are written from ONE REAL RUN. A node was asked for two
// marketing pictures; it explored the workspace, read the site, generated both
// images, looked at each of them, and was regenerating when — fifty-six seconds
// in — it was told "LAND NOW" and landed with "stopped: 6 steps without
// progress". Two files really existed in its worktree at that moment. The
// person got a failed task and no mention of them.
//
// Both halves of that are pinned below: production is progress, and a node that
// is stopped anyway still hands over what it made.

// IS the spin. Its landing turn said "The six files are already written…

// and the person got ✗ failed and a kept branch next to a report saying it had
// finished. The threshold had never been a statement about the deliverable, and
// the harness was reading it as one ([Agent.landStopped]).

// spinLane answers the node's own lane by what is already in its context: it
// produces its deliverable if it has one, then aims at the SAME target over and
// over — the exact spin the counter exists to catch — and answers the LAND NOW
// turn with its own account of the work.
//
// It is written this way rather than positionally for [nodeLane]'s reason: the
// harness's own title call speaks on this lane too, and a script that counted
// turns would be asserting the order those happen to fall in.
//
// THE SPIN IS FINITE. The counter cancels the run, and the cancel is a message
// to a real model — this fake never reads one — so the lane stops calling tools
// of its own accord once the threshold has had every step it needs. What follows
// is the LAND NOW turn, which is the whole reason these tests exist.
