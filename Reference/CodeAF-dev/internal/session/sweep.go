// sweep.go is the idle reaper (docs/CHAT-V3.md, Decision 26): one pass over the
// session folders, once per launch, that expires droppings and removes litter.
//
// IT HAS EXACTLY THREE RULES, and the third one outranks the other two.
//
//  1. DROPPINGS EXPIRE. A file under a session's logs/ that nothing has touched
//     for a week is a job log, a stub or a frame nobody is going to read. It is
//     re-creatable by definition — that is what makes logs/ logs/ — so it goes.
//
//  2. LITTER IS REAPED. A session whose recorded workspace or launch directory
//     was under a temp directory is a conversation opened in a place the machine
//     itself considers disposable, and once a week has passed since the person
//     last said anything to it, the whole folder goes. This is the rule that
//     stops the flat layout's failure repeating: nineteen dead /tmp workspace
//     directories on the author's own machine, none of them wanted, none of them
//     removable without reading each one.
//
//  3. NOTHING ELSE IS EVER TOUCHED. transcript.jsonl is FOREVER, work/ is a
//     person's own content, and a session whose transcript is flocked is a live
//     conversation in another window. A sweep that could delete a real
//     transcript would make every one of them provisional, and the whole value
//     of a journal a person can cat, grep and rsync is that it is not.
//
//  4. AND THE AMBIENT SIDE'S OWN LITTER GOES THE SAME WAY. The standing root
//     accumulates two things nobody asked to keep: the folder behind an errand
//     said at home that came to nothing, and the run folder of a firing that
//     delivered nothing. Both are reaped after [standing.RunKeep] and both are
//     asked the same two questions rule 2 asks — is anybody holding it, and has
//     anything touched it lately — with a third for a run, which is whether the
//     run itself said it came to nothing ([standing.RunCameToNothing]). The
//     items, the ledgers, the wake log and every run that said, landed or is
//     waiting for the person are outside its reach by construction, and so is
//     everything under v3/projects: rule 4 walks exchanges/ and <id>/runs/ and
//     nothing else, and answers immediately on an empty root.
//
// The two removals are DIFFERENT ACTS and the third rule reads differently
// against each. Rule 1 reaches into logs/ and nowhere else, so no expiry can
// ever reach a transcript or a person's work/ whatever its age. Rule 2 removes a
// whole folder — its work/ and its transcript with it — and is allowed to only
// because of what it proved first: a temp-rooted session is the disposable kind
// by construction (Decision 26: "ephemeral" is not a mode a person picks, it is
// what an owned session in a temp directory already is), and a week has passed
// since the person last spoke to it. Everything that fails either half of that
// proof keeps its transcript forever.
//
// The pass is a pure function of a directory and a clock so that it can be
// proved rather than argued about: [SweepPlaces] takes both, and every failure
// is one line to the caller's note and a move to the next folder. A sweep that
// stopped on the first unreadable directory would be a sweep that never reached
// the litter.
