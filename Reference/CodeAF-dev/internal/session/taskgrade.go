// THE GRADING LOOP, AND THE TWO ENDS OF IT THAT NEVER MET.
//
// A task node settles with a rich outcome: a check has read the work and said
// whether it holds, the work was sent back some number of times before it did,
// and the whole thing has a model, a bill and a duration attached to it
// (task_run.go, task_audit.go). Meanwhile the divider hands out parts and
// decides how much thinking each one is done with by reading ONE WORD the
// dividing worker wrote — `mechanical` or `careful` — which is a guess made
// before anybody opened the material (task_divide.go).
//
// Both ends existed. Nothing joined them. `codeaf models` — the panel that
// exists precisely to ground a choice like this one — printed "nothing measured
// yet. Ratings appear once calls have been graded" on a machine that had settled
// weeks of tasks, because the only thing that had ever written into the ledger
// was internal/router, and the chat engine does not route through it. So on the
// self-build run of 2026-08-31 all four test-writing lanes were graded
// `mechanical` and given the cheap tier, produced nothing usable, and the store
// that could have said "this kind of work does not hold on that model here"
// stayed empty (issue #147).
//
// ── WHAT THIS FILE DOES, IN ONE BREATH ──
//
// Every settled node writes one graded record into the SAME store `codeaf
// models` reads, and the divider reads that store before it assigns a tier.
//
// ── THE GRADE IS THE CHECK'S OWN ANSWER, AND NOTHING ELSE ──
//
// NO MODEL CALL IS MADE HERE. The check at the end of a task has already read
// the work, already cost what it cost, and already said one of three things:
// the work holds, the work is missing these gaps, or nobody could say. That
// answer IS the grade — it is written on the node the moment it is given
// ([TaskNode.checkSaid]) and read off the node when the node settles. A second
// judgement pass would be spending somebody's money to re-derive a fact the
// harness already owns, and it would put a token-generating path on a road that
// nothing asked for.
//
// A node that never reached a check is honestly ungraded. It still writes its
// record — the diary is the diary — but an outcome nobody judged moves no
// rating, which is the ledger's own law about unverified successes and provider
// failures restated for this road (internal/provider's verdict.go).
//
// ── THE KIND IS THE DIVIDER'S OWN WORDS, NOT AN ENUM ──
//
// What is being rated is not "tasks"; it is a KIND of work. The kind is the
// name whoever handed the work out gave it — "the eleven adapters", "tests for
// the rail" — lowercased and cut to its words, and nothing else. There is no
// taxonomy, no list of domains, and no rule about what any word means, because
// the next piece of work is always some kind of work nobody enumerated (the
// same argument prompts/shape.md is written on). "Mechanical" stops being a
// prompt's guess and becomes a fact somebody measured.
//
// Two kinds are THE SAME KIND-SHAPED WORK when their words overlap by half or
// more ([taskKindsMeet]). Names are short, so half is two words out of three:
// "tests for the rail" and "tests for the composer" are one population and "the
// eleven adapters" is not in it. Set overlap and not a stemmer, a stopword list
// or a similarity model — a list of function words is a rule about English, and
// this has to hold for work in any domain, in any vocabulary, named by any model.
//
// WHAT THAT RULE CANNOT DO is stated here so nobody has to discover it: two
// names that differ by one word are one family WHICHEVER word it is, so "write
// the adapters" pools with "write the tests" exactly as the pair above pools.
// No rule over word sets separates those two cases without a grammar. The two
// ways of being wrong are deliberately not the same size — a family drawn too
// wide costs one part of one division on a dearer model, and a family drawn too
// tight costs a lift that never happens — so the loose reading is the one taken.
//
// (internal/craft holds a tokenizer with a stopword list and a stemmer. It is
// NOT this: it ranks documents for BM25 retrieval, where dropping grammar keeps
// a short request from scoring on its articles. Here the words on both sides
// come from the same kind of short label written by the same kind of writer, so
// the grammar cancels and the list would only be something to maintain.)
//
// ── WHERE IT IS WRITTEN, AND WHY THAT IS THE SAME PLACE ──
//
// internal/router's Ledger is the ratings store, and `codeaf models` reads it
// out of the person's profile directory. A second store would be a second
// answer to "how good is this model at this", which is the drift the
// one-source-of-truth law exists to stop — so a settled node observes into that
// ledger under [provider.ClassTaskNode] with its kind as the shape, exactly the
// way a routed leaf observes under exec.leaf with its own, and the diary row
// beside it is the same router.Event every routed attempt writes.
