// The tool layer's half of one refusal: a frame asked for past the end of the
// clip.
//
// It has a file of its own because it is a REGRESSION AND NOT A FEATURE. ffmpeg
// exits 0 when it is seeked past the last frame, having decoded nothing and
// written nothing, so every layer above it agreed the frame had been saved and
// the model was handed a path to an empty png — which it then passes to
// generate_video as the opening frame of the next shot. internal/video refuses
// it now; this proves the refusal travels all the way to the model, which is
// the only place it matters.
