// ── THE TURN THAT DIED WITH NOTHING WRITTEN DOWN ────────────────────────────
//
// SWE-Marathon run s2, 22:45 UTC. Three calls in fifteen seconds came back with
// no content and no usage — journaled as EMPTY ASSISTANT MESSAGES, which the
// remains-reader then read as a turn that had stopped short and re-opened, three
// times, at mark-reader prices. Then the turn died on:
//
//	error: after 3 retries: API error (400): Provider returned error
//
// and the benchmark cell settled with five hours of budget unspent. Nothing about
// the 400 reached the journal at all — no row, no status, no endpoint, no
// provider name, no upstream body — so the autopsy could say a turn had died and
// nothing whatever about why. These tests are the four things that changed.

// A FAILED CALL IS WRITTEN DOWN, WITH THE UPSTREAM AND ITS OWN WORDS.
