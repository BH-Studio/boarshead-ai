// THE GROUND LAW: A TASK INHERITS ITS PARENT'S WORLD AS IT IS.
//
// ── THE RUN THIS WAS WRITTEN FROM ──
//
// A parent task drew a division and carved five children for its parts. Every
// child was grounded the way task_run.go had always grounded one: `git worktree
// add` off the ground's HEAD. The parent's entire implementation was
// UNCOMMITTED, so not one child got a world with the change its own brief
// described. The briefs were excellent and named exact files and symbols of a
// world that was not on the disk the workers woke up on. All four checking
// lanes were doomed at birth: one looped for $7.99 rewriting a file its brief
// said had been deleted until the step cap killed it, one failed, two were
// turned back by their checkers. About $14 and an hour of wall time were spent
// proving the ground was stale.
//
// The old road even said what it was doing, in as many words: "WHAT THE BRANCH
// CARRIES IS HEAD AND NOTHING ELSE" ([cutTaskWorktree]). It was true, it was
// documented, and it was the defect.
//
// ── THE LAW ──
//
// A HANDOFF HANDS THE PARENT'S WORLD AS IT IS, NEVER A REFERENCE TO HISTORY.
// The ground of a child is the parent's state at the moment of the handoff —
// edits nobody committed, files nobody added, the data beside them — by
// construction and in every domain. A research task inherits the notes gathered
// so far, a media task the assets, a coding task the tree. "The world" is a
// directory in every one of them, and forking a directory is a solved problem.
//
// ── THE LADDER ──
//
// There is ONE ladder and it is walked highest rung first. Each rung answers
// only whether it can reach THIS ground; a rung that cannot is not a failure and
// is never reported as one, because the rung below it is the answer. A rung that
// REACHED a ground and then could not make its world is the other answer, and it
// ends the walk with its own words rather than falling through — see
// [groundRung] for why the two may never be one.
//
//  1. [universeRung] — furrow forks the whole workspace, byte-exact: the files,
//     the untracked ones, the ignored ones, the dependencies, the `.env`, the
//     dev database, and a repository's own `.git` with them. It is the only
//     rung that carries what git cannot see, and on a copy-on-write filesystem
//     it is the cheapest of the three as well.
//  2. [snapshotRung] — a machine commit of the parent's tree, untracked files
//     included, made on the task's own branch, and the child's worktree carved
//     FROM THAT COMMIT. Never from HEAD, never from a remote ref.
//  3. [copyRung] — the folder copied file by file. It is the rung that was
//     already here, and it always obeyed the law.
//
// ── THE LADDER CHOOSES THE WORLD; THE LANDING KEEPS THE PROMISE ──
//
// This is the line that decides what a rung may do, and it is worth stating on
// its own because the obvious reading of "furrow first" breaks it. A REPOSITORY
// GROUND WAS PROMISED A BRANCH: its work comes home as a merge, the person can
// read the diff, a failed run leaves a branch they can check out. A furrow
// universe is a whole repository of its own, registered with nobody, so for one
// release the ladder kept that promise by refusing a repository the top rung
// altogether. The cost was written down right here: a repository task could not
// inherit a `.env`, an installed dependency tree or a dev database — which are
// exactly the files a repository is configured not to see, and exactly the ones
// the ground law was written to hand over.
//
// THE PROMISE IS KEPT BY THE LANDING AND NOT BY THE REFUSAL. A universe of a
// repository is a byte-exact copy of that repository, `.git` and all, so the
// task's branch is cut INSIDE the fork and the node's commits are made there.
// At the landing one `git fetch <the fork> <the branch>` puts those commits in
// the ground's own repository ([taskTree.carryBranchHomeLocked]) and the merge
// that follows is the merge that was always there. The person is handed the
// same branch, the same merge, the same diff and the same rail; what is new is
// a child that can read the `.env` and run the tests without installing
// anything first.
//
// So a rung may choose ANY world that is the parent's world as it stands. What
// a rung may still never do is change how the work comes home.
//
// WHAT THE RUNGS BELOW STILL CANNOT CARRY, SAID OUT LOUD: the snapshot rung is
// git's world, and git's world stops at `.gitignore`. A machine whose furrow
// will not run, a folder furrow will not attach, a ground whose `.git` belongs
// to somebody else (a linked worktree — see [universeReaches]) all fall to it,
// and on it a task inherits every tracked and untracked file and none of the
// ignored ones. Which of the two happened is never a guess: every rung writes
// down which rung it was.
//
// ── AND WHAT THE CHILD RECORDS ──
//
// A world a task worked in that nobody can name afterwards is a report nobody
// can check. Every rung writes down which rung it was and the one string that
// identifies the world it made — furrow's sealed snapshot, the machine commit's
// sha — onto the tree, onto the node, and into the node's own log.
//
// ── AND WHY codeaf ATTACHES THE FOLDER ITSELF ──
//
// Every codeaf carries furrow ([internal/furrowbin]), so the half of the answer
// that used to vary by machine no longer does; what still varied was whether
// somebody had remembered to type `furrow watch` in this project. A capability
// the binary carries and never engages is this codebase's absent-not-broken law
// running backwards, so a task about to be grounded in a folder attaches that
// folder ([furrow.Attach]) on the same consent as the write it was already
// going to make there. It attaches ONLY THE FOLDER IT IS ABOUT TO FORK: a
// workspace nothing would use furrow for is a workspace nothing here touches,
// because a side effect with no purpose is not consent, it is litter. Every way
// the attach or the fork can go wrong — no furrow, a folder it will not take, a
// machine where it takes too long — falls to the next rung down, so the worst
// case of the top rung is a bounded pause and yesterday's behaviour.
//
// ── AND A PAUSE THAT BOUGHT NOTHING IS PAID ONCE, NOT ON EVERY TASK ──
//
// That bargain was written for a pause that happens once. Measured on the
// owner's laptop, 2026-09-11: ninety-three nodes admitted over three days, every
// one of them grounded on the snapshot rung, and every one of them had first
// attached, sealed and forked its whole workspace and thrown the fork away —
// about fifteen seconds in front of each task's first request, for a rung that
// had not succeeded there once. Nothing said so: every way the top rung could
// fall answered a bare false, so the reason went nowhere and the next node paid
// again.
//
// So a rung that FELL says why, into the node's own log with how long it cost
// ([groundClimb]), and a fork that could not be made of a ground is REMEMBERED
// for that ground (groundfalls.go): the next node standing on it does not try
// again until something that could change the answer has changed — this codeaf,
// or the furrow it runs — and its log says it did not try, and why.
//
// AND THE FORK IS SEALED THROUGH THE SAME DOOR AS THE SNAPSHOT. It used to seal
// itself with `git checkout -b` and `git commit`, which run the person's hooks
// and honour their signing configuration — a commit-msg rule, a pre-commit lint,
// a signing agent that will not answer a subprocess — where the snapshot rung's
// [sealGroundWork] writes its machine commit with plumbing that runs none of
// them. Two ways of writing one kind of commit is one way that fails on a
// repository the other works on, which is exactly the shape of that census.

// ── THE WORDS A PERSON READS ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// groundWords is THE TABLE: the plain words for the copy of the ground one task
// worked in, one line per rung, and the only place any surface may get them.
//
// IT EXISTS BECAUSE A RUNG IS A RECORD AND NOT A SCREEN WORD, which is the law
// [TaskMode] states about itself one file over. `universe` and `snapshot` are
// how this package writes down what it did; a surface printing either of them
// would be handing somebody the machinery's own vocabulary, which this codebase
// bans in anything a person reads.
//
// THE DEFECT IT CLOSES was a surface doing exactly that from the other end. The
// settled card labelled every task's directory `worktree` — the machinery's word
// for the rung below, printed with no idea which rung had run — so once the
// universe rung reached a repository (#183) a person reading the card was told
// the mechanism that was NOT in use: the work had happened in a fork.
//
// ONE TABLE AND MORE THAN ONE READER. The settled card in the project's record
// and the landing note a task writes when it comes home both name where the work
// was left, and they are read minutes apart about the same node (internal/tui3's
// taskrecord.go and taskdone.go). Two surfaces wording one fact separately is two
// wordings that drift, and a person told "worktree" by one and "its own copy" by
// the other has been given two places when there was only ever one.
//
// THEY NAME NO MACHINERY AND THEY NAME NO PATH. What a person needs from this
// line is whether the work happened somewhere of its own or in the folder they
// are standing in, and — where it was a repository — that a branch of theirs is
// what came back. The seal, the fork id and the machine commit are the record's
// business ([taskTree.world] writes the long form into the node's own log).
var groundWords = map[GroundRung]string{
	// A fork is a copy of the whole folder, `.git` and all, so the words are the
	// copy's words below and not a second spelling of one fact. A person cannot

	// line that made them learn it would be the machinery leaking again.
	GroundRungUniverse: "its own copy of the folder",

	// checked out somewhere else — which is the one thing about it they can act

// written from that index, and the commit is written with `commit-tree`, which
// touches no ref at all. The parent's index, HEAD and working tree are exactly
// as they were; what is new is one commit object and, when the caller carves
// from it, a branch pointing at it.
//
// ── WHAT IT CARRIES, AND WHAT IT HONESTLY CANNOT ──
//
// `git add -A` is everything git can see, WHICH INCLUDES THE UNTRACKED FILES
// THE PARENT CREATED — the half of the defect that a `git stash` or a
// `diff HEAD` would have missed. It does not include what `.gitignore` covers,
// and it cannot: those files are not in git's world at all. Carrying them is
// exactly what the rung above this one is for.
//
// ── AN INDEX OF ITS OWN MEANS ONE PER SEAL, NOT ONE PER REPOSITORY ──
//
// The private index used to be a fixed name, `codeaf-ground-index`, and one
// parent's siblings are carved CONCURRENTLY — the frontier starts every part of
// a division at once, and each of them seals the same parent tree before
// [cutWorktreeFrom] takes the repository lock. Two seals sharing one file is one
// removing the index the other is writing, an index lock git refuses, or a tree
// written from half of somebody else's staging. So the name carries [shortID]
// and every seal has a file nobody else can be holding.
//
// ── AND A FAILURE IS NOT A CLEAN TREE ──
//
// The two used to be the same answer, the empty string, and that is how the
// race became silent: git refusing read the way "the parent had nothing
// uncommitted" reads, and the caller carved the child from HEAD. So a clean
