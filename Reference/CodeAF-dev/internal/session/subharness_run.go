// A SUBHARNESS RUNNING IS A TASK, AND A TASK IS A PLACE.
//
// This is the other half of the asymmetry harness_task.go fixed from one side.
// DESIGNING a harness became a node with a row, a room, an id and a stop; RUNNING
// one stayed what it always was — a turn, held open for as long as the program
// took, with the conversation frozen behind it (harness.go's runHarnessRoute).
// The thing a person most wants to walk away from was the one thing they could
// not: no number to refer to it by, no room to watch it in, and no way to end it
// short of interrupting the whole turn.
//
// So a run is admitted to the WORK GRAPH (task_run.go) as a node of its own, and
// it buys exactly what the design bought:
//
//	a row on the roster        with the program's own last line as its phase
//	a room                     enter it, watch the host calls land, esc out
//	a journal                  every ai(), tool(), ask() and log(), permanently
//	a stop                     the same ✕ and the same `Cancel("task:9")`
//	a settle card              what the run produced, or why it did not finish
//
// ── THE TASK SURFACE IS A PRESENTATION OF A RUN, NOT ITS DEFINITION ──
//
// Everything below is about drawing a run for somebody. The run itself is
// [exec.Runner.Run] and knows nothing about any of it — which is what lets the
// headless command (cmd/codeaf) run the same program through the same runner
// with no task system in the process at all. If this file ever became necessary
// to running a subharness, the contract would have quietly acquired a dependency
// on a terminal.
//
// ── IT IS ADMITTED, NOT PROPOSED ──
//
// [Agent.proposeTask] asks before the work starts, on a countdown. This does
// not, for [Agent.reserveHarnessDesign]'s reason said about a different door:
// THE QUESTION ALREADY HAPPENED one step earlier. Every path into this file goes
// through the intake card and somebody confirming it — chat's proposal
// (tools_subharness.go), `/subharness <name>`, or a person filling the card in.
// A countdown here would be two questions about one decision.
