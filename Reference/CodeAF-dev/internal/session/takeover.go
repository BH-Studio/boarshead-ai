package session

// takeover.go is how a conversation open in ANOTHER WINDOW is moved to this one.
//
// A local conversation lives inside the process of the terminal that opened it,
// and its journal is held under a flock nothing else can take (sessionfile.go).
// A second terminal cannot join it; it can only ask the holder to let go. This
// file is that ask, and it is the shape answers.go already is: ONE FILE in the
// session's own folder, written by whoever asked, picked up by the holding
// session on the heartbeat it already runs.
//
// ── THE FOUR LAWS ──
//
//   - THE HOLDER DECIDES NOTHING. A request found on the tick is announced to
//     the surface drawing that session and nothing else happens here: the
//     surface detaches and closes the conversation the way /new does, its
//     tasks land "paused — it resumes", and the window that asked resumes them
//     from the checkpoint. The engine never closes itself from inside a tick.
//
//   - A REQUEST IS ANSWERED AT ONCE, MID-REPLY OR NOT — WITH ONE EXCEPTION,
//     which is a request that was already lying on the disk before the running
//     turn opened ([Agent.drainTakeover] states it). It used to be held back
//     until the running turn ended, on the reasoning that a reply is never cut
//     — and the cost of that reasoning was the defect this road was reported
//     for: a person pressed enter, confirmed, and watched `coming here · 4m50s`
//     while a long reply finished somewhere they could not see. Nothing is lost
//     by answering now. The holder interrupts and closes the way /new does
//     (internal/tui3's takeOver), which lands its running work as
//     `paused — it resumes`, and the window that asked resumes it from the
//     checkpoint with whatever the reply had said already in the journal.
//
//     AND A TURN THAT HAD SAID NOTHING AT ALL IS ASKED AGAIN THERE. This law
//     used to end at "the partial reply", which quietly assumed there was one:
//     a turn that had only been THINKING keeps no partial, so the conversation
//     arrived in the new window as a question with nothing under it and the
//     person was told to ask again. They do not have to any more — the window
//     that took it re-asks their question itself, off the shape the journal
//     ends in (resume.go).
//
//   - A REQUEST IS TAKEN OFF DISK BEFORE IT IS ANNOUNCED, so a holder that is
//     slow to let go is asked once and never a second time on the next beat,
//     and a request left by a window that gave up ([CancelTakeover] removes it,
//     and a stale one is ignored by age) is not found by a session opened a
//     week later.
//
//   - IT RIDES THE TASK LANE. The standing lane is the one subscription that
//     outlives every turn on every surface — the front conversation pumps it
//     and a kept one drains it (internal/tui3's keeper.go) — and standing news
//     already rides it for exactly that reason ([Agent.emitStandingNews]). A
//     lane of its own would be a third subscription for one event a session
//     sees at most once.

// THE COST IS ONE OPEN OF A PATH THAT IS NOT THERE. [takeoverAsked] reads one
// file in the session's own folder, and on every session on the machine except
// the one being asked for, that read fails at the first syscall — which is
// cheaper per second than the two-hundred-byte temp-write-and-rename the
// heartbeat already does every five seconds. What it buys is the difference
// between a conversation that arrives when you press enter and one that arrives
// a few seconds later for no reason a person can see.
//
// IT IS THE ASKING WINDOW'S BEAT, TO WITHIN A GLANCE. The window waiting looks
// at the flock five times a second (internal/tui3's takeover.go); a doorstep
// slower than that would make the flock beat pointlessly fine, and a doorstep

// generous because a holder mid-reply waits for the turn to end before it looks
// again, and a long reply is minutes, not seconds.
//
// IT IS EXPORTED BECAUSE THE ASKING WINDOW HAS TO KNOW IT. Past this age no
// holder will ever answer — [takeoverAsked] deletes the request unread — so a

// cannot happen, and the one number that says so has to be the same number on
