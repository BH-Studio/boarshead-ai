// A RUN'S WALL TIME IS ONE PAIR OF INSTANTS, and this file is where the pair is
// decided, so that no surface decides it again.
//
// A hand-off's run is measured from the HAND-OFF — the instant its row is born
// and first reads running ([beltRun.born], the first notice's StartedAt) — to
// the instant the program it handed its task to was gone
// ([delegate.ProgramRecord.EndedAt], stamped by the run's worker); for a run no
// program worked, or whose program never recorded an exit, to the instant the
// run's engine answered ([beltRun.ended]). Its elapsed time is the one minus the
// other ([runSpan]).
//
// EVERY SURFACE READS THAT PAIR, and it used to read four. The task page counted
// from the store's seeding, which is before the copy is cut (sixteen seconds on
// a real run), to whichever moment each kind of ending happened to write the
// store; the row and the card counted to the row's settling, which is after the
// landing and the summary refresh (up to a quarter of a minute more); the tasks
// tool and the landing note said no time at all. The same run read `22m 51s` on
// its page and `22m44s` on its card. Now the settle notice (and so the rail, the
// card and the checkpoint), the page's row ([planRunClocks]), the project index,
// the tasks tool and the landing note all carry the one pair. The program's own
// spawn stays on its record beside it, as a fact of the record, and nothing
// counts from it.
