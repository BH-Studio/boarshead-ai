// The auditor: the one thing standing between a node's last words and the word
// "done".
//
// ── WHY A NODE MAY NOT MARK ITSELF FINISHED ──
//
// Before this file existed, a task node's done-state was its own self-report:
// the child agent stopped calling tools, said something confident in its final
// message, and the graph wrote that down as TaskDone. Everything downstream —
// the dependents' briefs, the merge onto the person's branch, the note in the
// conversation — was built on a sentence the executor wrote about itself.
//
// That is the failure mode LongHorizon-Harness names in one line
// (harness-research-notes.md §1, arXiv:2608.01964): task state is updated ONLY
// from independent audit evidence, and executor self-reports never flip a
// record to completed. An agent that has spent forty steps on a change is the
// worst available judge of whether the change works — not because it lies, but
// because it has been reasoning about its own intentions for forty steps and
// its intentions are what it will grade.
//
// So the frontier advances on EVIDENCE. When a node's run finishes, a fresh
// auditor — no shared context, no memory of the trajectory, a different agent
// on the HIGH tier — is pointed at the node's worktree, runs the repository's
// own verification, reads the diff, and answers VERIFIED or REFUTED with the
// three lines of evidence it is standing on. VERIFIED is the only thing that
// merges. REFUTED is a TaskFailed carrying the auditor's evidence as the
// report, and the cascade in runFrontier fails its dependents with it, which is
// exactly right: work built on top of work that does not hold is work built on
// nothing.
//
// ── ROLE SEPARATION IS THE SAFETY ARGUMENT ──
//
// The auditor's belt is COMPOSED, not filtered by a flag: the four readers
// (read, grep, find, ls) and a bash that refuses everything outside a named
// allowlist of verification commands. It cannot edit, write, install, fetch or
// paint. That is what makes its verdict worth anything — an auditor that could
// fix what it found would be an executor with a second name, and the first
// thing it would do is repair the thing it was sent to judge and then report
// success. It is also why the belt is built here from bare's tools rather than
// by adding a config flag to the session's belt(): "which hands does an auditor
// have" is a question with one answer, written once, in the file that depends
// on it.
//
// ── WHY THE VERDICT IS TWO WORDS AND THREE LINES ──
//
// The same reason the guardian's contract is one word (guardian.go): a verdict
// with a middle answer has a middle answer nobody has defined, and the first
// thing a model does with an undefined answer is use it. So the auditor is
// still asked for one of two words, and everything that is not VERIFIED leaves
// the work unmerged: the frontier fails CLOSED, and the worst a broken auditor
// can do is keep good work on a branch with an explanation attached.
//
// ── BUT A NON-ANSWER IS NOT A VERDICT ──
//
// Failing closed is about what MERGES. It is not a licence to write down a
// finding nobody made. An auditor that answered with neither word, or that was
// never asked at all because the provider errored, has told us exactly nothing
// about the work — and recording that as REFUTED is the harness inventing
// evidence and then cascading it through every dependent. That is a false
// failure, and it was observed in the wild: a deep-research node landed as
// "REFUTED — the auditor answered neither VERIFIED nor REFUTED".
//
// So a non-verdict is asked ONCE MORE — a fresh auditor, the same evidence
// packet, which is the whole remedy for a truncated reply or a provider blip —
// and if the second attempt is also not a verdict, the node lands UNVERIFIED
// (task_contract.go). Unverified is settled and it is not failed: the branch is
// kept, nothing merges, nothing cascades, and the dependents wait for the one
// thing that can move them, which is a person deciding ([Agent.ResolveUnverified]).
// A REAL REFUTED verdict is untouched by any of this — it is a finding, it
// fails the node, and it takes the dependents with it, exactly as before.
//
// ── THE LADDER UNDER A NON-ANSWER: NUDGE, THEN A FRESH AUDITOR ──
//
// A fresh auditor is the expensive rung. It re-reads the diff, re-runs the
// verification, re-pays the whole investigation — and none of that is what was
// missing when an auditor did all the work and then stopped one word short (the
// one seen in the wild ended on "Let me be targeted:" with no tool call and no
// verdict). That auditor is still sitting there with the evidence in its
// context. Asking IT for the word costs one turn.
//
// So the ladder is NUDGE → FRESH AUDITOR → UNVERIFIED, and the first rung is
// taken only when there is a lane to take it on: a delivered reply that did not
// PARSE into a verdict. A provider error, an auditor that never started, a
// deadline that ran out — none of those has a live auditor behind it, and each
// goes straight to the rung that builds a new one, exactly as before. The nudge
// is one line and it demands the contract, nothing else: an auditor asked to
// "reconsider" is an auditor being led.
//
// ── THE REPAIR LOOP: REFUTED IS NOT ALWAYS THE END ──
//
// A REFUTED verdict used to land the node dead on the spot. What that costs was
// measured in the wild: a deep-research node produced a 138-line report covering
// ten companies, the acceptance asked for eleven, the auditor correctly refuted
// it — and the person re-typed the entire task by hand. The work was 90% there
// and the harness threw all of it away because the last 10% was missing.
//
// So a finding now buys the node a REPAIR ROUND (task.repair_rounds, one by
// default, 0 for the old behaviour): the SAME worktree, a fresh worker, and the
// original brief with the gaps in front of it. Then a fresh auditor judges
// again. Refuted with the rounds spent is the old landing — TaskFailed, branch
// kept, cascade — except that the report now carries the evidence of EVERY
// round, because "it was sent back twice and this is what was still missing" is
// the only version of that story a person can act on.
//
// THE AUDITOR IS NEVER TOLD IT IS JUDGING A REPAIR. Same evidence packet, same
// contract, no round number, nothing about what the last one found. An auditor
// that knows the work has been fixed once already is an auditor with a reason to
// be satisfied, and the whole value of this gate is that it has none. CONVERGENCE
// COMES FROM THE LOOP, NOT FROM A SOFTENED JUDGE: the worker is told what is
// missing, the judge is told nothing.
//
// ── THE VOCABULARY LAW ──
//
// NONE OF THE WORDS IN THIS FILE REACH A PERSON. Not "auditor", not "audit", not
// "verdict", not VERIFIED, REFUTED or "unverified" — not in the outcome written
// to the project's index, not in the report on a landed notice, not in the note
// the chat model reads off the steering lane. The machinery is real and it is
// named honestly HERE, in the code, the comments, the job log and the audit's
// own journal. What lands in front of a person is what HAPPENED:
//
//	verified          the work's own account, with the evidence sentence under it
//	                  — the state already says done
//	refuted out       "incomplete — " and the plain gaps, every round of them
//	nobody could say  the question the row is asking ([yourCallLead]) and what
//	                  the checker said — led by "the check ran out of time" where
//	                  the clock is what stopped it ([auditVerdict.ranOut])
//
// The reason is not squeamishness. The person did not ask for an audit; they
// asked for a report on eleven companies. "REFUTED" tells them about the
// harness's internal court, and a chat model reading it will repeat the court to
// them, in its own sentence, as though a trial had happened. "incomplete — the
// report covers ten companies, amp-labs is missing" tells them the thing they
// can act on, which is the same fact with the machinery taken off it.
//
// TWO LITERALS ARE EXEMPT, AND ONLY BECAUSE THEY ARE ADDRESSES. The settings key
// `task.audit` names a switch the person can throw, and `reaudit` is a word the
// model must type back to the `tasks` tool. A handle somebody has to type is not
// a finding about their work, and translating it would leave them holding a name
// that opens nothing.

const auditPrompt = `You are an AUDITOR. Somebody else did a piece of work and says it is finished. You decide whether that is true, and your verdict is the only reason it can be called finished at all.

You are READ-ONLY. You have read, grep, find and ls, and a bash that runs the repository's own verification and nothing else. You cannot edit, write, install, or fix anything, and you must not try — the work is not yours to repair. Your job is to find out what is true.

Judge the work against its ACCEPTANCE and nothing else: not what you would have written, not what else the code could use, not how the change was made. Run the verification yourself and read the diff. A claim you did not check is a claim you have not verified.

AND WHAT THE WORK SAYS ABOUT THE WORLD IS PART OF WHAT YOU ARE CHECKING. Anything it asserts — a note it wrote listing what stopped being true, its own account of what it did — is a claim, and a claim is checked by going and looking: what something says is a search, what something now does is a thing to run, what was updated somewhere is a question about which files changed. An assertion that is not so is a finding even when the work itself holds. If you could not settle one, say so by name in your evidence rather than passing over it.

A CHECK THAT PASSES ONLY BECAUSE OF SOMETHING THE WORK DID NOT WRITE HAS NOT PASSED. Installing, building and caching are expected — do them freely, they are what your time is for. What may not carry a verdict is state that does not ship: a file put somewhere by hand, a link made so a path would resolve, a directory created outside the change. If what makes the check pass is not in the files the work wrote, REFUTE and name what is missing.

How deep you look follows the size of what the work CHANGED. Where it rewrote something load-bearing, take the whole ladder: run the verification, read the change through. Where the deliverable's answer is that NOTHING needed doing, do not re-derive the whole claim — go hunting for the one thing that WOULD have needed doing, because that is the only thing that can make the answer wrong, and coming back empty-handed is your evidence.

Then answer in AT MOST four lines. The first word is the verdict:

VERIFIED — what you ran, and what you saw
REFUTED — what you ran, and what you saw

VERIFIED means you ran something and it passed. REFUTED means it did not pass, or there was nothing there to have passed, or you could not check. When in doubt, REFUTE. Write nothing except the verdict and your evidence.`

//
// A PASSING CHECK MAY NOT DEPEND ON STATE THE DELIVERABLE DOES NOT CARRY. That
// is the law, and until this section existed nothing enforced it.
//
// What it cost was measured. A node was asked to make a language server pass a
// scorer; the scorer addressed files as `file:///workspace/test-files/…` and the
// repository kept them somewhere else. The node worked out exactly why the
// scorer failed and then fixed the WORLD instead of the WORK — `ln -sf
// /workspace/java /workspace/test-files` — re-ran the scorer against its own
// symlink, watched it pass, and reported the job done. The auditor then ran in
// the same directory, with the same symlink under it, and saw the same pass. The
// deliverable was a repository that fails the moment it leaves that machine, and
// every party that looked at it agreed it was finished.
//
// SO THE AUDIT DOES NOT JUDGE WHERE THE WORK HAPPENED. It judges a CLEAN
// RESTORE: an untouched copy of the repository with exactly the files the node
// wrote laid over it, and nothing else the run left behind. An environment-only
// fix is absent there and the check fails on its own, with no rule anybody had
// to remember and no prompt anybody had to obey.
//
// THE RESTORE IS BUILT FROM WHAT THE HARNESS ALREADY KNOWS THE NODE WROTE —
// `changed`, the same list [stageTaskWork] stages, [commitTaskWork] commits and
// the card names (task_run.go). There is no second record of the deliverable and
// there must not be one: two lists would be two answers to "what ships".
//
// AND THE BUILD PRODUCTS ARE NOT COPIED. A restore carrying the node's `target/`
// would be carrying the very thing it exists to leave behind. The auditor
// installs and builds in the restore itself — that is what its allowlist is for,
// and what its five minutes are spent on.

// auditGround is the directory an auditor is put in, and whether that directory
// is a restore or the node's own working copy.
//
// The fallback is not a failure: a workspace with no repository behind it and no
// record of when the work started cannot be reconstructed, and a verdict reached
// where the work happened is the verdict this build has always reached. What the
