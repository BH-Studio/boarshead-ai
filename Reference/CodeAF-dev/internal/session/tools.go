// belt is the session's tool inventory: the seven file tools — read, bash,
// edit, write, grep, find, ls — with their verbatim schemas and descriptions.
//
// The hands are bare's, not a second copy: the session works the way a
// subharness leaf works, and a divergence between them would be a divergence
// between what the person watched happen and what the workforce would do with
// the same instruction. The workforce verbs (task/change/stop) are not here
// yet; when the tasker attaches they append to this slice and nothing else
// changes.
//
// There is deliberately no todo tool (docs/CHAT-V3.md Decision 11): a plan
// the person can read beats state only the model can see, and work big enough
// to decompose belongs to the workforce, not to a session-local list.
//
// The rest are the session's own rather than bare's: bash is WRAPPED (not
// replaced) so it can start a background job, read is WRAPPED so a PDF is a
// file it can answer for rather than a file it returns as bytes (tools_pdf.go
// — the tool grows a sense, the belt does not grow a tool), read_document
// stands BESIDE it as the rung that sentence names — the scanned page, the
// photograph, the docx that read turns into bytes (tools_doc.go: a second hand
// here and not a second sense, because this one costs money and the split is
// where the bill is), jobs is added
// beside it to look
// at what was started and watch beside that to be TOLD instead of looking
// (tools_jobs.go, tools_watch.go), remember carries the person's durable memory
// (memory.go) when there is a store to keep it in and search_conversations reads
// the other half of that store — the verbatim words of every earlier
// conversation, which were indexed and unreachable until it existed
// (tools_conversations.go) — track, commit and recall hold
// the working state a compaction must not lose (state.go — the same file's three
// records, unconditional because every session compacts), and web_search and web_fetch
// reach outside the machine (tools_search.go) when a back end was wired, and
// generate_image paints (tools_image.go) when an image model was. bare
// is untouched — a subharness leaf gets bare's bash exactly as before, and the
// session gets bare's bash plus one argument.
//
// propose_task (task.go) is the one hand that gives work AWAY: the model grooms
// a self-contained piece, the person gets a countdown to redirect it, and an
// approved node runs as its own agent in its own worktree.
//
// The last groups are CONDITIONAL, and each says why at its own source: a belt
// is what the model has been promised, so a tool with nothing behind it is left
// off rather than added and made to refuse.
//
// tasks (tools_tasks.go) is propose_task's other end: the project's whole task
// history, searchable, so that work handed off weeks ago is still findable by
// the model that has to build on it.
//
// resultCaps is how much of one tool result this conversation's model can
// afford to be handed, and it is the answer the whole belt is built with.
//
// IT FOLLOWS THE WINDOW. bare's flat caps — 2000 lines or 50KB — were measured
// against a 128,000-token window, which is exactly what [Agent.window] answers
// when no model card says otherwise, so a frontier conversation gets them
// unchanged and is byte-identical to what it was. A model with a smaller window
// gets a smaller share of it, because a read that fills 78% of everything the
// model can hold leaves it the file and no room to think about the file.
//
// It reads [Agent.window] rather than [Agent.trustedWindow]: the caps are
// rendered into the descriptions in message[0], and a bound that moved when
// this process learned something about an endpoint would re-price the whole
// conversation cold.
func (a *Agent) resultCaps() bare.Caps { return bare.CapsFor(a.window()) }

// build_harness and list_harnesses (tools_harness.go) are the ONE big machine
// left on this belt and the list that says whether the thing about to be built
// already exists: a saved procedure this project can be offered again. They are
// the model's to reach for BY DESIGN — the judgement "is this a recipe, or just
// work" is one no cue list can make — and both are absent where their machinery
// is (no registry, no runner, nobody watching to answer the card).
//
// THE PLANNER-AND-FLEET RUN WAS A THIRD HAND HERE (`run_adaptive`) AND IS NOT ANY
// MORE. The judgement it asked the model to make — is this wide enough to plan up
// front — is a guess made before anybody opens the material, and the road that
// won makes it from the material instead: one task, admitted wide, handing the
// parts out as it finds them (task_divide.go). The engine still ships, and since
// the cue that read a typed request for a run went too (loop.go) NOTHING in a
// conversation reaches it: the model has no verb for a run, and neither does
// anybody typing — which is what "absent, not refusing" means when the thing
// taken away is a hand.
//
// settings and change_setting (tools_settings.go) are the person's own
// configuration: the sheet read back by its registry keys, and one row of it
// written permanently into the profile through the registry's own validated
// write. They are two tools rather than one with actions because the approval
// gate keys on the tool NAME, and reading a person's settings and rewriting them
// must not share one answer. They are absent together where there is no profile
// directory to read.
//
// services and use_service (tools_connect.go) are the accounts the person
// already has somewhere else. They are the one family on this belt that can
// GROW it: what an account brings — a mailbox, a calendar — is appended when the
// account is picked up rather than carried by every conversation that will never
// touch mail. THE APPEND IS THE ONLY MUTATION THIS SLICE EVER SEES, and
// connect.go states why nothing may move.
//
// A TASK NODE'S BELT IS THIS BELT MINUS THREE, AND MINUS FIVE AT THE FLOOR OF
// THE TREE. watch comes off because its whole delivery mechanism is a note
// arriving in a conversation, and a node has none. The two settings hands come
// off for the sharpest reason there is: a node runs in a worktree with nobody
// watching it, so a settings change made there is a permanent change to the
// person's machine that no transcript ever showed them — and the node was
// briefed to do one piece of work, not to retune the product around it.
//
// AND ON THE EXPERIMENT BRANCH THERE IS A THIRD ANSWER: THE SIX FILE TOOLS
// COME OFF ENTIRELY. spark/bash-task-loop hands a task worker ONE bash tool —
// bare's, with the branch's head+tail+path cut and the session's background
// argument — and the kept hands that cannot be a shell command, under a strict
// one-action-per-response envelope (bashbelt.go, bashbelt_envelope.go). It is
// a SECOND composition behind [Config.mayBashBelt], set from CODEAF_TASK_BELT
// at the one place a worker's Config is built (task_run.go's
// [Agent.newTaskAgentOn]); unset, the belt above is byte for byte what it was,
// and internal/exec/bare is untouched — the hands stay its, and the
// experiment is a wire change, never an engine change.
//
// propose_task and tasks STAY, and they are one pair. A node may hand parts of
// its own work further out (task.go's fan-out law) — the proposals join the
// conversation's own graph under the node that made them, so there is no second
// machine and no second id space — and `tasks` is how the node then watches
// those children, reads what they found and says a line into one that is going
// the wrong way. In a node that tool is SCOPED TO ITS OWN FAMILY
// (tools_tasks.go): a node's brief is still its whole world, and a node
// rummaging through the project's history would be a node reading the
// conversation it was deliberately given none of.
//
// Both come off together at the floor, by [Agent.mayProposeTask] rather than by
// a check here: a node standing on taskDepthLimit can have no children, so it is
// given neither the verb nor the window onto them. The three big machines come
// off by their own gates for the same kind of reason: a node is handed no
// registry, no harness runner and no orchestrate runner, so it can neither
// commission a procedure nor start a run of its own. Everything else a node has
// is exactly what the conversation has, which is the point: it is the same
// worker, working somewhere quieter.
