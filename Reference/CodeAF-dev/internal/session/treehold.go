// ── WHILE A NODE HOLDS A TREE, THE CONVERSATION IS A READER OF THAT TREE ────
//
// THE MEASURED FAILURE. SWE-Marathon run s10, 10:34:28Z. A node was handed
// /workspace/rust-java-lsp to repair. There was no git in that container, so the
// node's working copy was the workspace ITSELF — [prepareTaskTree] returns
// `merge: inplace` for a directory it cannot branch, which is the honest answer
// and also a promise nobody was keeping. At 10:40:18Z, six minutes in, the
// CONVERSATION wrote src/analysis.rs whole — a full-file overwrite from a turn
// that had read the file before the node started — and it landed underneath the
// repair. Neither side did anything wrong by its own lights. Both were writing
// to the one tree, and what came out was neither of their work.
//
// THE LAW: AN IN-PLACE NODE TAKES A WRITER'S CLAIM ON ITS TREE FOR AS LONG AS IT
// RUNS, INCLUDING WHILE IT IS BEING CHECKED AND REPAIRED. A write from anywhere
// else — the chat, a fork hand, a sibling node — is REFUSED at the write guard,
// with the holder named and something the writer can actually do instead.
//
// ── WHY REFUSED AND NOT SERIALIZED ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The two obvious answers to "two writers, one tree" are a lock and a refusal,
// and this codebase has already picked between them twice for the same reason.
// fork.go refuses overlapping write scopes AT THE CALL, before any hand starts,
// rather than interleaving them; taskground.go refuses to merge work whose paths
// somebody else moved under it. Both because A LOCK MAKES EACH WRITE ATOMIC AND
// LEAVES THE TREE JUST AS WRONG. The measured overwrite was already atomic. What
// destroyed the repair was not two writes tearing each other's bytes, it was one
// whole-file write built from a reading of the file that the other writer had
// since replaced — and no ordering of those two calls produces a tree either
// author intended.
//
// So the second writer is told no, and told who has it.
//
// ── WHY THE CLAIM IS DERIVED AND NOT REGISTERED ─────────────────────────────
//
// There is no claims table and nothing to take or put back, because the claim is
// not a separate fact: it IS "this node is running, and its tree is not a
// worktree of its own". Both halves are already in the graph, written by
// [TaskNode.setTree] before the node's first tool call and cleared by the node
// ending — landing, failing, being stopped or being cut off by a closing
// process. A registry beside them would be a second copy of a fact that can go
// stale in exactly the case that matters most: a node killed halfway would leave
// its claim standing and lock the person out of their own repository forever.
// Deriving it means the release is not code anybody has to remember to write.
//
// ── WHO IS FIRST ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Two in-place nodes on one tree resolve by WHO STARTED FIRST, and the later one
// is the one refused. That has to be a total order that every agent computes
// identically without asking anybody, or the two would refuse each other and the
// tree would belong to nobody; run-start does it, and admission order breaks the
// ties (the graph keeps `order` for exactly this determinism reason).

// treeClaim is one running node's hold on one tree, in the three facts a refusal
// needs: who it is, what it is called, and where the tree is.
type treeClaim struct {
	id    uint64
	title string
	dir   string
}

// claimOver answers who holds the tree that `path` is inside, from the point of
// view of `writer` — the node id the writing agent belongs to, and 0 for the
// conversation itself.
//
// It answers false, meaning "write away", in every case but one: some OTHER
// running node is working in a tree it did not get isolated, and the path is
// inside it.
//
// THREE THINGS ARE NOT SOMEBODY ELSE, and each is a rule this package already
// states elsewhere:
//
//   - The holder itself. A node writing in its own tree is the whole point of
//     having one.
//   - The holder's own family. taskground.go's second law, in its own words:
//     "THE NODE'S OWN FAMILY IS NOT SOMEBODY ELSE" — a part cut out of a node's
//     work, or a hand of that node's worker, is that node writing.
//   - A writer whose OWN tree sits strictly inside the holder's. That is a
//     sibling working in an isolated worktree that happens to live under the
//     workspace, and it is writing in its own copy, not in the holder's.
//
// Paths are compared as they are spelled, cleaned. Nothing here evaluates
// symlinks, and it does not need to: an in-place tree's directory IS the
// Workspace string it was built from ([prepareTaskTree]), and a write's path is
// resolved against the writing agent's own Workspace ([Agent.mutatingPath]), so
// the two sides of this comparison are the same string by construction.

// fileOwner answers who holds the FILE `relative` is, from the point of view of
// `writer` — the node id the writing agent belongs to, and 0 for the

//
// THE MEASURED FAILURE. Audit F36: a worktree task was writing cart.py, the
// chat edited the same path on the person's tree, a second task was spawned at
// the same files, and the person's branch ended matching none of them. The
// worktree kept the bytes apart. It did not keep the logical file to one
// owner, and a merge cannot invent one afterwards.
//
// THE LAW: A RUNNING NODE THAT DOES NOT HOLD ITS TREE OWNS EVERY PATH IT HAS
// ALREADY WRITTEN. A write of one of those paths from anywhere else — the chat,
// a sibling node — is refused with the holder named. One owner per file at a
// time.
//
// IT IS A FACT AND NOT AN INTENT, the same bar [TaskNode.wrote] is held to:
// a path is owned because a saving call came back, never because the brief
// named it. A node that has written nothing yet owns nothing, which is why
// [TestAWorktreeIsolatedNodeDoesNotClaimTheWorkspace] still holds — the
// person is not locked out of their repository for a node that has not
// touched a file.
//
// AND IT IS EVERY NODE THAT DOES NOT HOLD ITS WHOLE TREE, not only the ones in
// a copy of their own. A quick task writes in its caller's folder with no tree
// claimed — it must not lock the person out of their own directory, and two of
// them run side by side ([Agent.runQuickNode]) — and until 2026-09-11 that left
// it holding NOTHING: the one kind of node writing in the person's own folder
// was the one kind whose half-written file the chat or a sibling could
// overwrite, while the manual said the first writer owned it. What decides now
// is how the node stands ([TaskNode.holdsTreeLocked]), never whether it has a
// branch: a node that holds its tree is answered by [claimOver] for every path
// in it, and every other running node owns the paths it has written, by name.
//
// THE NAME IS THE LOGICAL FILE, in whichever copy the writer is standing: a
// path relative to the writer's own workspace against a path relative to the
// holder's. For a worktree node that is the F36 law — the copies keep the bytes
// apart and the merge would put them back in one file — and for a quick task
// the two are the same file on disk, because it writes where its caller works.

// early starts included, and a check written into the belt's write tool instead
// would be a check the next tool appended does not have (hooks.go).
//
// IT BINDS EXACTLY WHAT [writeGuard] BINDS — every call whose target is a path
// this process can read before the call runs, which is edit, write and the three
// edit_video actions that write one (recovery.go's [mutatedPath]). A shell
// command's effects are whatever it did, and a guard that pattern-matched
// commands would be promising something it cannot keep. The hole is the same
// hole, named in the same place, and it is smaller than it looks: the measured
