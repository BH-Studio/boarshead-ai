package session

// Reading a transcript WITHOUT opening it.
//
// A picker of past conversations needs three things about each of them — what
// it was called, what was last happening in it, and when that was — and it
// needs them about every session in a directory at once. Opening each one is
// the wrong way to learn that: [openSessionFile] takes an exclusive flock,
// rebuilds every image part and repairs the transcript, so a list of twenty
// sessions would be twenty locks a running window is holding, twenty replays,
// and a picker that cannot show you the conversation you are currently in.
//
// So this is a read and nothing else: open, scan forward, close. It never
// locks, never writes, never creates the file, and it costs one pass over
// lines it mostly discards.
//
// It reads what the file SAYS rather than the transcript a resume rebuilds,
// which is the one place its answer and a resume's can differ: a rewind with
// nothing typed after it leaves the message it took back as the last thing the
// file heard. That is a stale sentence in a picker row, and the alternative is
// paying for a replay per row to be right about the rarest line in the journal.
