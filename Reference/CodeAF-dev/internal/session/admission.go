package session

// The working context a task is admitted with: a bounded, attributed selection
// of the conversation the work came out of, and the calls that already ran.
//
// A node's opening document already carries the person's own sentence and the
// contract groomed out of it (task_brief.go). This is the middle it never
// carried — a constraint typed two turns earlier, the assistant's reading of a
// file it had just opened, the arguments of the call that failed.
//
// Three invariants hold everything here together:
//
//   - A quote is evidence of what was SAID, never of what is true. Nothing in
//     this package classifies, concludes or summarises; the only judgement is
//     which lines to carry, made by recency and role.
//   - The selection is incomplete by construction, so every entry names a record
//     a worker can open and [admissionQuotesRule] says the selection is partial.
//   - Nothing missing is reported as something good: an outcome this process did
//     not record renders as unknown rather than as success.
//
// Compilation is in admission_compile.go; this file is the record, its
// persistence and its rendering.

// ── what the worker reads ───────────────────────────────────────────────────

// The two sections and the rules over them. task_brief.go decides where they sit
// in the document; what they may claim is decided here.
//
// The quotes rule carries the safety of the feature: the lines were said rather
// than established, the selection is partial, and the work above is still the
// work. It deliberately does not rank quotes against the contract — a quoted
// line that contradicts the brief is news for the report, not a precedence rule
// for a worker to apply alone.
//
// THE EVIDENCE RULE DOES RANK, AND THE TWO ARE NOT INCONSISTENT. A quote is
// somebody's SENTENCE and can be wrong about the world; a handle is a call that
// this harness watched run, so it is not an opinion about what is left to do —
// it is a fact about what has happened, and a document holding a fact beside a
// contradicting instruction owes its reader the order to read them in. Nothing
// said it, and the measured cost was a worker that read "WHAT IS LEFT, AS PARTS"
// naming reads this section already listed as done, obeyed the louder and earlier
// of the two, and spent its first minutes doing finished work again. The two
// writers upstream are told not to make that document in the first place
// (checkpoint.go's [checkpointSketchAsk] and [checkpointHandoffWriteAsk]); this
// is what the worker does when one reaches it anyway.
//
// AND IT MOVES NO BYTES TO SAY SO. A successful result's body is still absent by
// the law stated at the head of this file — the precedence sends the worker to
// the POINTER it was already given, which is the cheapest possible way for it to
// find out what a call meant and is the road [AdmissionHandle.line] already
// renders.
