// THE QUICK ROAD: what happens to a turn that only READ.
//
// checkpoint_test.go holds the full handover — the worktree, the brief a second
// model writes, the arming, the division. Everything on this page is the other
// answer to the same moment: a drawing with parts in it, out of a turn that
// touched nothing under the workspace, is one worker working through the parts
// IN ORDER, WHERE THE PERSON IS STANDING (checkpoint_quick.go).
//
// The three things that could quietly stop being true are pinned here: that the
// road is chosen off the write seam's own counter and nothing else, that the
// drawing arrives as the node's items rather than as a division to hand out, and
// that a turn which wrote is untouched by any of it.

// for what is a reading; now it buys one node, started here, with the drawing as
