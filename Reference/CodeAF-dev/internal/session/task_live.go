// A RUNNING NODE'S PRESENT, KEPT SO SOMEBODY CAN ASK FOR IT.
//
// Everything else this build knows about a task is either a plan or an epitaph.
// The index is what the work CAME TO (task_index.go); the notice is its state
// and its age (task_contract.go); the report is what it said at the end. In
// between — the eleven minutes a node actually spends working — the only thing
// that existed was a STREAM: the child's events, published into the room for
// whoever happened to be subscribed at that instant (task_room.go). A surface
// can live on a stream because it is always there, folding events into a row as
// they arrive. THE MODEL CANNOT. It is not there: it is inside a turn that ends,
// and when it next thinks to ask "how is task 7 doing" the answer under the old
// arrangement was the same two facts a spinner has — running, four minutes —
// which are equally true of a node stuck on one `go test` and of a node calling
// a tool every second.
//
// So the stream is recorded as it passes: the call in flight, how many steps
// have finished, and a short ring of what the node has been saying and doing.
// Three rules hold it up.
//
//   - IT IS A TAIL, NOT AN ARCHIVE. Two hundred lines, each clipped, and the
//     whole thing thrown away with the session. The node's transcript is a real
//     session file on disk and the model already has hands to read it
//     (task_index.go's TranscriptURI); a recorder that kept everything would be
//     a second copy of the journal, in memory, for a question that is about the
//     last minute.
//
//   - IT RECORDS WHAT THE NODE SAID AND WHAT IT CALLED, NEVER WHAT ITS TOOLS
//     RETURNED. Event.Output is display-only by contract — a capped copy for a
//     surface to expand — and a tool result the model reads must come off the
//     wire, not off a rendering of it. What is here is the node's own narrative
//     and the calls it made, which is what "what is it doing" actually asks.
//
//   - IT IS FED FROM ONE PLACE: [taskRoom.publish], the funnel every one of the
//     child's events already goes through. A second tap on the child's stream
//     would be a second ordering of the same events, and the two would disagree
//     exactly when it mattered — under load.
//
// It outlives the room's close on purpose. A node that landed a second before
// the model asked still answers with the last thing it was doing, and the row
// above the answer says the work is over.
