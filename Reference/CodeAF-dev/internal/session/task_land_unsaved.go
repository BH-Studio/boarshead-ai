// task_land_unsaved.go is one law for both landing roads: A LANDING THAT COULD
// NOT SAVE THE WORK IS NOT A LANDING.
//
// Both roads used to answer the same mark for the failing attempt as for the
// ordinary one. A branch landing threw away what [commitTaskWork] told it, merged
// a branch holding nothing, and released the working copy — so the one file the
// worker wrote was gone from the person's branch AND from the disk, under a card
// that said done (#255). A folder landing answered [mergeInPlace] after a copy
// that stopped halfway, leaving the person's folder with the first half of a
// deliverable and a row that read finished (#256).
//
// What is here is what the two share: the reading of an outcome, the sentence a
// person is given, and the one question [stageTaskWork] has to answer before a
// landing may go on. The roads themselves stay where they are.

// cameHome reads a landing's outcome as the one question every road asks of it:
// did the work get where the person can see it?
//
// IT IS A QUESTION RATHER THAN A COMPARISON, because the roads used to test
// `merge == mergeConflicted` by hand and a second reason to keep a branch —
// work that could not be committed at all — walked straight past all five of
// them. A mark nobody may land on is added here once, and every road refuses it.
func cameHome(merge string) bool {
	switch merge {
	case mergeConflicted, mergeAborted:
		return false
	case mergeKept:
		// FINISHED WORK ON A PROTECTED CHECKOUT IS COMPLETE. It is visible on
		// the named branch and unblocks dependents even though no checkout moved.
		return true
	default:
		return true
	}
}

// landingRefusal is WHY a landing could not be saved, in the two kinds that have
// to be answered differently.
//
// ── THE DIFFERENCE IS WHETHER ASKING AGAIN CAN CHANGE ANYTHING ──────────────
//
// A landing that failed goes back to somebody to decide, and their answer runs
// the same commands into the same place. Where what refused was THE WORK — a
// commit a hook would not take, a change git would not sign — a second answer is
// worth having: the person can fix the thing that was refused and accept it
// again. Where what refused was THE PLACE — a directory that is not a repository,
// a read-only mount, a full disk, a folder with a file where a directory has to
// go — the second answer gets the same refusal, and the third, which is exactly
// the loop a measured run spent its parent's remaining minutes on: accept,
// refuse, offer, accept, refuse, offer (#513).
//
// SO THE PLACE REFUSING SETTLES THE NODE WHERE IT STANDS and the work refusing
// keeps today's road. Nothing is lost either way: no merge happens, no working
// copy is released, and the report names the directory the only copy is in.
//
// AND IT IS DECIDED WHERE THE REFUSAL HAPPENS, never afterwards from the
// sentence. [stageTaskWork] asks git whether the place is a repository at all and
// answers that arm outright; [taskTree.landMirror] knows a folder that would not
// take the lay is the folder refusing; and the one arm where only git's prose
// exists puts the question to the tree itself ([askTheTree]) rather than reading
// it back out of git's prose.

// askTheTree asks THE REPOSITORY ITSELF whether it can still be written to, and

//
// ── IT USED TO READ GIT'S PROSE, AND PROSE IS NOT EVIDENCE ──────────────────
//
// The five phrases that name a place git will not write — no repository, a
// read-only mount, a permission, a full disk, a quota — turn up in sentences
// that are about the WORK just as readily. A hook that prints "permission
// denied" and refuses the commit, a path with `read-only file system` in its
// name, a message quoting an error somebody else's tool produced: each of those
// is answerable, and each of them was being settled for good on the strength of
// a substring (#513). A landing settled wrongly this way cannot be accepted
// again, which is the one mistake on this road that a person cannot undo.
//
// ── SO THE QUESTION IS A WRITE, WHICH IS THE THING THAT WAS REFUSED ─────────
//
// A scratch file is created inside the repository's own git directory and
// removed again. A tree that takes it is a tree a second answer could get past,
// whatever git said about the first; a tree that refuses it with the errno of a
// read-only mount, a permission, a disk with nothing left on it or a quota is
// the PLACE refusing, and it will refuse the same way next time.
//
// AND ANYTHING ELSE IS THE WORK. A probe that fails for a reason nobody
// recognises keeps the landing on the road it has always taken — back to
// somebody, with the branch kept and another answer allowed — rather than
// settling a node on a guess. The one tree refusal that is NOT asked here is a
// directory that is no repository at all: [stageTaskWork] already asks git that
// as a question and answers it where it happens.
func askTheTree(dir string) landingRefusal {
	// THE GIT DIRECTORY IS ASKED FOR BY NAME rather than assumed to be `dir/.git`,
	// because a node works in a worktree, where `.git` is a FILE naming the real

	// where it keeps itself is probed where it stands, which is the safe side of
	// the answer: an unrecognised failure is the work.

// spent. Everything else — a name that is already taken, a directory that moved
