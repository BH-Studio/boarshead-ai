// NESTED WORK, AS TESTS: a task that finds independent parts inside its brief
// hands them out, and the family that makes is one the person can see, steer and
// stop.
//
// Every test here drives the real doors — the belt the node is actually handed,
// the tool call it actually makes, the graph the conversation actually owns —
// because the whole of nesting is that there is NO second machine: a sub-task is
// a node in the conversation's own graph with one field filled in (task.go).
// What is scripted is only the part a test may not have, which is a worktree and
// a provider.

// ── THE FAMILY'S LEDGER ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// A family's product is its LEDGER — the paths it wrote — because the ledger is
// what a landing carries: [stageTaskWork] stages it on a repository ground and
// [taskTree.landMirror] lays it back over a folder one, and nothing anywhere
// walks the directory (task_ledger.go, and task_landing_test.go's header for
// what walking it cost).
//
// So a parent that hands work out has a ledger with a hole in it. The parts
// wrote into ITS tree and their paths are on THEIR lists; on a repository ground
// git closes the hole underneath, because a part's work arrives as commits on
// the very tree the parent merges. On a folder ground nothing closes it: the
// mirror held every file the family made, the parent's ledger named its own, and
// the person's folder got that one. The task said done and the check passed.
//
// The two tests below are that, run rather than described — a real graph, real
// workers, a real mirror, and a real folder to land into.

// familyCompleter is ONE provider standing behind a whole family, which is what
// a family really has: every worker in a tree is built with the conversation's
// own client ([Agent.newTaskAgentOn]). Each node is told apart by a mark its own
// brief carries, read off the FIRST user message and nowhere else — a parent's
