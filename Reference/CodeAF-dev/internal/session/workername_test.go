// WHAT THE WORKERS UNDER A RUN ARE CALLED, and what the run's own row says in
// the minute before there are any.
//
// Both come off one screen. A run divided into nine workers drew nine rows, and
// every one of them read "You are a" — three words off the front of the brief
// that worker opens on, because nothing on a planned node was a NAME. And above
// them the run's own row sat blank for the whole opening planner call, so the
// interval where the shape of the work was being decided looked exactly like an
// interval where nothing was happening.
