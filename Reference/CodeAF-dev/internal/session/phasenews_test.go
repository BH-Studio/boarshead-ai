// ── THE PHASE CLOCK, AS A TURN MOVES IT ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// Three laws are pinned here, and each of them is a defect that was reported
// rather than a shape somebody liked:
//
//   - A TURN SAYS WHAT IT IS DOING BETWEEN REQUESTS, and everything it says it
//     also finishes saying. A phase left open is a clock a surface goes on
//     drawing for work that ended.
//   - A SIDE ERRAND NEVER OWNS THE CLOCK. The status line belongs to the answer
//     somebody is reading, never to whichever call happened to answer last.
//   - ONE MECHANISM ANSWERS ONE SILENCE. This package no longer keeps a hedge
//     of its own; the transport's does, and a silent stream is asked for once.

// phaseLog is every phase this package posted, in order.
