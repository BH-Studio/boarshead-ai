// THE BASH BELT'S PER-STEP FRAME AND ITS RESUME CLAUSE, AS TESTS.
//
// Wave 2 of the bash-only task-loop experiment
// (docs/design/bash-task-loop/DESIGN.md): the frame a bash-belt worker reads at
// each step boundary, and the one sentence a resumed node's opening carries.
// What is scripted is only the provider and, for the resume, the flag the
// interrupt door leaves behind; everything the assertions read — the room's
// recorder, the node's spend, the family queue, the transcript — is the real
// instrument the frame renders from.
