// The session file is JSONL: one header line, then one line per COMPLETED
// message and per compaction pass. Append-only and line-oriented, so a crash
// mid-write costs the last line and nothing before it, and a resume is a
// forward read with no rewrite.
//
// Content is flattened to text. A session's messages are text — the tools
// return text and the person types text — and keeping the part array would
// buy fidelity for a shape that does not occur while making every line
// unreadable to the person the transcript is for.
//
// The one part that is not text is an image, and it is journaled as a REFERENCE
// rather than as content: path, digest, media type. A 4MB photo base64'd into a
// JSONL line is how a session file dies — it becomes unreadable to a person, it
// is re-read into memory on every resume, and it grows the file by more than the
// whole conversation around it. The bytes are already on disk at a path this
// machine can read, so the journal writes where they are and what they were, and
// the replay checks the second before trusting the first (see [journalPart]).
//
// The file is locked while it is open. Two codeaf processes resuming the same
// path would both replay it and both append, and their lines interleave into
// one transcript that belongs to neither — the last writer's resume reads the
// other's messages as its own. A resume picks the newest file by mtime, so the
// two windows converge on the same path by default rather than by accident.
// openSessionFile therefore takes a non-blocking exclusive flock and the loser
// gets ErrSessionLocked, which names the file so the surface can offer "open it
// where it is" or "start a new one".

// SWE-Marathon run s2, 22:45 UTC. A turn ended with `error: after 3 retries: API
// error (400): Provider returned error`, the session went idle, and the
// benchmark cell settled with five hours of budget unspent. NOTHING ABOUT THE
// 400 REACHED THIS FILE — no row, no status, no endpoint, no provider name, no
// upstream body — so the autopsy could say that a turn had died and nothing
// whatever about why. A journal that records every call that worked and nothing
// about the ones that did not is a journal that answers the easy question.
//
// So: EVERY FAILED CALL WRITES ONE, and it carries what an autopsy has to ask
// for otherwise. Status, Provider and Raw come off the refusal itself
// (internal/provider's APIError); Endpoint is who the router said was serving;
// Attempt is which rung of the retry ladder this was, so three rows for one step
// read as one ladder rather than three steps; and Input is THE ESTIMATE the
// session made of the request it was about to send, which is the only token
// figure a failed call has — the provider counted none.
//
// Output and DurationMS are the exception to "the provider counted none", and
// they exist for ONE class of failure: a guard cut (internal/provider's
// StreamCut). A cut stream ran for a measurable time and delivered a measurable
// amount of answer before it was ended, and those two figures are what tell a

// finished. Every other failure leaves both empty, which is the emptiness law:

// drawing had parts in it, a turn past its write allowance, and the ceiling that
// gave this record its name — because the ending is decided there and nowhere

//
// It is a line of its own rather than a field on the mark above it because the
// two are different facts about different moments — the mark is a reading and
// this is an act — and because a handover can fire with no reading behind it at
// all (a sidecar nobody could reach still meets the ceiling).
//
// Decision is `moved`, `dropped:nothing-left` — the running model declared the
// work finished AND the mark's own reader agreed nothing remained — or one of the
// two ways a handover ends with no task of its own: `dropped:no-brief`, when
// nothing could be written down for anybody, and `dropped:work-already-out`, when
// everything there was to write down was about pieces this conversation is still
// holding and therefore nobody else's to take (checkpoint.go's custody road). On a
// run with a goal owner two more are possible, and both mean the turn was sealed
// at the handover with no task started: `dropped:stopped`, the owner read the
// ending and stopped the run with a reason, and `dropped:done`, the owner read it
// and said the ask was met (checkpoint.go's [Agent.endTurnUnderSteward]). And the
// write seam writes one more of its own, `dropped:delivering-own-result`: the turn
// is finishing the delivery of a result this conversation already owns, so the
// counter stood down and the work stayed here (writeseam.go's
// [Agent.writeSeamFires]). TaskID names the node when one was ADMITTED, and is
// absent otherwise by the emptiness law the rest of the line keeps — the delivery
// row admits nothing and names its result in Reason instead, so a bench counting
// tasks started off that field still counts only tasks.

// (checkpoint.go's [Agent.handOverRunningTurn]): `handoff`, `draft` or `ask`.

// worker on a document written out of the turn's findings, the other started it
// on the person's bare sentence — and until this field the file could not tell
// them apart. The [journalCarry] lines directly above say WHY it was that rung;
// this is the one-word answer a bench can count.
//
// ── AND SEAM IS WHICH DOOR TOOK THE ENDING ──
//
// THE NAME OF THIS RECORD IS OLDER THAN WHAT IT RECORDS. It was the CEILING's
// line, because the ceiling was the only door that wrote one — so a handover the

// and the real-model runs behind #567 all ended with an empty list of these while

// drawing with parts in it, `write` for a turn past its write allowance, `ceiling`
// for the last rung of the ladder.
//
// A ROW WITH NO SEAM ON IT WAS WRITTEN BEFORE THIS EXISTED, and it is a ceiling by

// [journalCarry] ladder above it saying why each rung produced nothing, and
// `dropped:nothing-left` has no reason to give — nothing contradicted the work being

// (auxiliary.go), and none of them says when anything began.
