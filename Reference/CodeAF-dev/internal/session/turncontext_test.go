// WHAT A PERSON IS PART OF WHILE THEY STAND IN A NODE'S ROOM.
//
// A design thread is the one node somebody TALKS INSIDE rather than watches, and
// until [TaskNode.context] existed nothing on the wire said so — every surface
// drew a sentence typed at a design exactly as it draws a remark to nobody in
// particular. These hold the engine's half: the node names itself, the name
// reaches the notice, an ordinary node names nothing, and the name is the page's
// own once there is a page.
