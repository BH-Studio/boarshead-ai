// THE FOLDER FAMILY TREE, AS TESTS (issue #230).
//
// The claim under test is one sentence: a family whose ground is a plain folder
// isolates and lands exactly like a family whose ground is a repository. So
// these drive the real doors — the same [prepareTaskTreeOn] a running node
// calls, the same stand a part is grounded on, the same [taskTree.comeHome] a
// part lands through — and assert the four things the issue asks for: a mirror
// that is a repository, a part that works somewhere its parent is not, parts
// that cannot see each other's work, and both parts' work sitting in the mirror
// before the family lands.

// ── THE RECIPE AS A SCRIPTED NEST ───────────────────────────────────────────

// THE ISSUE'S RECIPE, DRIVEN THROUGH THE REAL DOORS. A mirror-mode parent on a
// temp folder calls `divide_work`; the two parts it names are admitted by the
// real division, started concurrently by the frontier, and run through the whole
// of [Agent.workTaskNode] — the tree preparation, the worker, the ledger, the
// landing. Nothing about the family tree is arranged by hand here, which is the
// point: the hand-driven tests above pin the seam, and this one pins that the
// seam is on the road a running family actually takes.
//
// IT IS THE OTHER ADMISSION DOOR AS WELL. A part admitted by `divide_work`
// carries no ground of its own at all (task_divide.go names no stand), so it
// reaches [prepareTaskTreeAt]'s default road and finds its worktree by asking
// the directory it is standing in — which is the mirror. The hand-driven test
// above covers `propose_task`'s door, which resolves a stand first. Both roads
// have to end in a worktree of the family tree, and neither is the other's test.
