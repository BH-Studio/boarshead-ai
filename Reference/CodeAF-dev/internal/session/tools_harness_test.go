// THE MODEL'S HANDS ON THE BIG MACHINERY, from the three sides that matter: the
// hands exist only where they can work, the goal is required and is passed
// through whole, and each one STARTS something and comes straight back.
//
// AND ONE HAND THAT IS NOT HERE ANY MORE. `run_adaptive` was the third of them —
// the model's own way to open a planned graph of nodes — and the tests that
// pinned its behaviour are gone with it rather than inverted, because there is
// nothing left to assert about a verb: what replaces them is the one test below
// that says the belt does not carry it even where a runner is wired.

// ── which hands a build has ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

// A CAPABILITY THAT CANNOT WORK IS ABSENT, NOT BROKEN. A model told it can build
// a harness plans around that for the rest of the conversation, so a build with
// no registry, no runner, or nobody watching does not carry the verb at all.
