// ── TELLING A SURFACE WHAT THE LANES DID ────────────────────────────────────
//
// A model id is an address; the LANE is the machine behind it. Which one
// answered, whether a rescue went out while you were waiting, and which of the
// two finished are three facts a surface draws and cannot see: a stream belongs
// to internal/provider and a turn belongs to this package.
//
// SO THE NEWS IS PUSHED AND THE ARROW POINTS THE RIGHT WAY. internal/tui3
// imports this package, so this package may not import it (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
// Decision 10's table, and the compiler). A surface registers a reader at open
// and this package calls it; a build with no surface registers nothing and the
// calls cost one nil check per answer.
//
// It is a package-level seam rather than a field on the agent for the same
// reason [provider.LastServed] is one: the surface that draws a status line
// does not hold the agent that ran the errand behind it, and a per-agent hook
// would have to be re-registered every time /new mints a session.
//
// TWO POSTS FOR A RESCUED ANSWER, ONE FOR EVERY OTHER. The middle state — a
// second request is out and nobody has committed — is the only interesting
// state of a hedge, and it is over before the call returns, so it cannot be
// reported from the answer. It arrives from [provider.HedgeReport.OnHedgeStart]
// instead, and it is the one place this build calls an answer slow.
//
// AND THAT SEAM CARRIES WHY, NOT ONLY WHO. It used to hand over a lane name and
// nothing else, so a lane that was LATE and a lane that had REFUSED the model
// outright arrived here identical and were drawn identically — `· slow · trying
// nextbit…` for a 404 that said the machine could not serve the model at all
// (issue #266). [provider.RescueNews] carries the transport's own
// classification, and a rescue that itself fails arrives a second time to
// withdraw the sentence the first one put on the screen.

// LaneNews is one answer's lane story, as the layer that sent it knows it.
//
// Anything unknown is left zero, and a zero field draws nothing — the emptiness
// law, said at the seam rather than at the surface, so that no reader has to
// invent a figure to have something to print.
type LaneNews struct {
	// Model is the model the answer came back on. A news with no model belongs
	// to nobody and is dropped.
	Model string
	// Lane is the machine the request WENT TO, and Winner the machine that
	// finished it. They differ only when a rescue landed, which is the whole of
	// what a surface means by "rescued".

	// Reason is why the rescue went out, in the transport's own two words —
	// [provider.RescueSlow] or [provider.RescueRefused]. Empty is a rescue
	// nobody classified, which a surface reads as slow.
	//
	// AND ONE WORD THAT IS NOT ABOUT A RESCUE AT ALL. [provider.RescueRetired]
	// is a person's own pin, refused by the router for this model and stood
	// down until they pin again (issue #456). It rides this seam because it is
	// the same KIND of sentence — something about the machine behind this
	// answer changed while you were waiting — and the fact also reaches the
	// conversation as a note of its own, which is the copy that stays.
	//
	// IT IS CARRIED AND NEVER DECIDED HERE. The word a person reads has to be
	// the word the ledger acted on, and a second opinion formed at this seam is
	// how a status line ends up disagreeing with the routing it is describing.
	Reason string
	// Failed WITHDRAWS a claim this seam already made: the lane named in Alt is
	// the one a `trying X…` was about, and it has now failed. A surface that
	// went on drawing the promise would be telling somebody about a request
	// that is over.
	Failed bool

	// Role is who the answer was for (internal/lane's roles.go). A surface
	// draws only the roles a person is reading: a naming errand and a memory
	// reflex both answer during an ordinary talk turn, and a status line that
	// took the lane and the rate from whichever of them finished last was
	// telling somebody about a machine that had nothing to do with the answer
	// they were waiting for.
	Role lane.Role

	At time.Time

	// Session is the conversation this answer belongs to, and it is EMPTY IN
	// EVERY BUILD THAT NEEDS NO ANSWER: one process with one window has nothing
	// to disambiguate. An engine that is a separate process from its surfaces
	// (internal/enginehost) reads it to decide which connection this sighting
	// belongs on — see [Agent.newsKey].
	Session string

	// Subject is WHAT THIS SIGHTING IS ABOUT, and it is [provider.PhaseNews.Subject]
	// under this seam's own name — the same spelling on both, because they are
	// twins and a surface that had to remember which of them called it what is
	// a surface that will key one desk differently from the other.
	//
	// EMPTY MEANS THE CONVERSATION, and that is the whole of the compatibility
	// story: every producer that names no subject is talking about the
	// conversation, so absence behaves exactly as it did before the field
	// existed. A node's own sighting names the node ([Agent.newsSubject]), so
	// its room can say which machine answered IT rather than showing whichever
	// answer on the same model id landed last.
	Subject string

	// Relayed says this news arrived over a connection from the engine that
	// produced it, rather than off this process's own stream. It is
	// [provider.PhaseNews.Relayed]'s twin and exists for its reason: a build

// reason: probing is a thing only the real adapter has, and a completer that
// does not offer one makes the capability ABSENT rather than present and
// failing. A test double, a build wired to no router, a session over a
// connection — all of them simply never probe.

// where it will go. A one-token request to the two lanes at the head of the
// frontier costs about two hundredths of a cent, lands in the ledger as a
// measurement of OUR path taken NOW rather than everybody's average over half
// an hour, and warms the connection so the real request's first token is not
// also paying for a handshake (internal/lane's probe.go).
//
// NOTHING WAITS FOR IT AND NOTHING CAN BE MADE SLOWER BY IT. It returns before
// anything is sent, the debounce is the prober's own — at most one pair every
// twenty seconds per model — and every gate that could refuse is asked inside
// it. A surface may therefore call this on every character typed, which is what
// internal/tui3 does, because a first keystroke is not a thing a composer can

// are not — and the three durations [lane.Lambda] takes after the first are the
// plan graph's to supply, which no build yet does.
// IT IS ASKED OF THE ROLE AND NEVER COMPUTED HERE (internal/lane's roles.go).
// The two answers this function used to give — a conversation is worth a
// person's attention, a node is worth it while somebody is here — are now two
// rows of a table that also decides the quality bar, the exploration horizon

// next fix to land in only one of.
