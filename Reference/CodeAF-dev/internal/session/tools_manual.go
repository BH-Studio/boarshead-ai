// The manual: what this chat knows about ITSELF.
//
// Every other tool on the belt reaches outward — a file, a page, a process, an
// account. This one reaches inward, and it exists because of a failure mode
// none of the others have. Asked "can you read a PDF?" or "what does rewind
// undo?", a model will always produce a fluent answer, and a fluent answer
// about the product is indistinguishable from a remembered one right up until
// the person acts on it. A WRONG ANSWER ABOUT codeaf IS WORSE THAN NO ANSWER,
// because the person cannot check it against anything: they asked precisely
// because they did not know.
//
// So the pages are written from the code, they ship inside the binary
// (internal/manual's chat/ folder), and completeness tests fail the build when a
// landed feature has no page. What the model reads here is the same text a
// person would read, which is the only arrangement where the answer and the
// product cannot drift apart.
//
// IT IS A READ AND RECORDS NOTHING. Looking something up is not an event in the
// conversation; it leaves no journal line and no memory, exactly as grep does.

// bargain the search tools make: enough to answer a question and its obvious
// follow-up, not so much that the answer becomes a quotation contest between
// four pages that all mention the word.

// manualDescription is what makes the model reach for this instead of
// improvising, so it says the quiet part out loud: you do not know this, and
// what you would produce instead is a guess.
//
// It is also prompt text billed on EVERY request of every turn, so it says that
// in the fewest words that still carry it. The sentence naming the two arguments
// went with the diet — the schema below names them, at the moment the model is
// choosing between them — and the schema itself is now compact rather than
// pretty-printed, which is how the rest of this package writes one.
//
// Bounding the page read (#293) put a third argument in the schema and told the
// model what a cut page hands back, so the examples paid for it: "what a command
// or key does" was a word-for-word copy of prompts/system.md's Tool Policy line
// for this tool, and the routing rule belongs in one place.
