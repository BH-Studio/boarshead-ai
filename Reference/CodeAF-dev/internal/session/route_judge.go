// THE ROUTE JUDGE: one cheap question, asked at the TWO MOMENTS a turn can
// still be handed over.
//
// The system prompt has a work-or-words law (prompts/system.md): a question, a
// discussion, a fact and a few tool calls are answered here; research across
// sources, changes across files and anything with several independent parts is
// handed over and answered afterwards. The law is a paragraph in a prompt, which
// means it holds exactly as often as the model remembers it, and the turn where
// it is forgotten is invisible: the person gets a good paragraph about work
// nobody started.
//
// So this file asks a SECOND model, and it asks it in two places.
//
//   - BESIDE the turn ([Agent.routeAhead]), reading the REQUEST and nothing
//     else. It is launched at the front of the turn and RUNS WHILE THE MODEL
//     ANSWERS. A yes is TRIAGE and no longer a conversion: it tightens the
//     checkpoint's meter so the work itself is read at the next step boundary
//     instead of after the full handoff price ([Agent.routeTriage]). A verdict
//     that arrives after the turn has finished is dropped.
//   - AFTER a turn that answered in words alone ([Agent.routeJudge]), reading
//     the request and two lines of what came back. A yes starts the work the
//     answer only talked about.
//
// ── WHY THE PRE-TURN READ NO LONGER CONVERTS ──
//
// It used to end the turn it was racing outright, and the benchmark took that
// away from it. Over ten measured cells the raced screen converted BOTH of the
// small-work traps — messages whose fastest correct answer was a few tool calls
// in the conversation, taken out of it and handed to a worker in a worktree. The
// reason is structural rather than a tuning problem: what this read has in front
// of it is a REQUEST NOBODY HAS WORKED ON YET, and no amount of confirming turns
// that into evidence about the work. Reading the work is what checkpoint.go's
// sidecar does, at a mark, over the transcript the turn has actually built.
//
// So the race keeps the thing it is genuinely good at — noticing early that this
// one is worth looking at — and gives up the thing it was bad at. A both-yes now
// pulls the first mark down to the very next boundary, and a person sees NOTHING
// at all until the reading of the work says something (THE EMPTINESS LAW: a
// judgement that changed nothing they can observe is not announced). What its
// verdict wrote about breadth and about the done-condition is kept and rides
// whatever task eventually starts.
//
// THE PRE-TURN READ EXISTS BECAUSE THE POST-TURN ONE CANNOT SEE THE FAILURE THAT
// COSTS THE MOST. A chat message carrying four independent pieces of work was
// answered, twice in measurement, by ninety-odd rounds of inline tool calls: the
// model had propose_task on its belt and a prompt that taught it to hand work
// over mid-turn, and a model deep in tool momentum does not stop to re-consult a
// verb it rarely reaches for. That turn never reaches the post-turn judge at all
// — it called tools, so the second law below excuses it — and by the time it
// ends, the grinding the hand-off would have prevented has already happened. A
// decision the model will not make mid-grind has to be made at a HARNESS SEAM
// before the grinding starts, which is what the pre-turn read is.
//
// NEITHER READ REPLACES THE OTHER. The pre-turn one judges a sentence nobody has
// worked on yet and is wrong in the cautious direction by design; the post-turn
// one still runs on every wordy turn and catches what reading the request alone
// could not have known.
//
// THERE IS ONE ROAD OUT OF HERE and it is a task ([Agent.launchRouteTask]).
// The judge used to name a shape, because there were two roads and the second
// was a planned graph; a chat turn cannot open one of those any more, so the
// word came off the wire with the branch that read it. Nothing was lost that the
// judge could still express: the breadth it used to reach for `adaptive` to say
// is said in `wide`, which arms the one worker to hand the parts out once it has
// opened the material (task_divide.go) — the same road, wider.
//
// SIX LAWS HOLD IT TO SOMETHING NOBODY WILL WANT TURNED OFF.
//
//   - A YES STARTS THE WORK, AND THE PERSON IS TOLD IT STARTED. There is no card
//     and no keypress. An offer is a modal row on a turn nobody said was unusual,
//     and it asks somebody to make a decision about work they have not seen — the
//     task itself is the better version of that question, because it is on the
//     rail, it says what it is doing, and it can be stopped from there. Being
//     told after is the honest shape; every law below is what makes it safe.
//   - IT NEVER SECOND-GUESSES A TURN THAT USED TOOLS. A turn that called tools
//     was already work of some size, and asking afterwards whether work should
//     have been work is a question with no useful answer — so the post-turn read
//     watches a TOOL-LESS turn only. The pre-turn read is made before any tool
//     has run, which is the whole reason it is made there.
//     (The pre-turn read starts nothing directly at all any more — it hands the
//     decision to the reading of the work — but the post-turn read still does,
//     and everything below is written about that.)
//   - IT IS RATE-LIMITED, and auto-start makes the limit MORE load-bearing rather
//     than less: at most one task every [routeJudgeGap] turns, which is also what
//     makes two in a row impossible. Somebody who has just stopped one is having
//     a conversation, and the second task started over the top of it is the one
//     that makes the feature a nuisance. ONE LIMIT COVERS BOTH READS — one
//     counter, one gap, one memory of when work last began — because the person
//     is being interrupted by TASKS and does not care which of the two moments
//     noticed. Two limits would be two tasks in one conversation's breath.
//   - IT IS SILENT WHEN IT CANNOT WORK. No router model, nobody watching this
//     session, a reply that is not JSON, a judge that would not answer at all:
//     each of those is one turn that behaves exactly as it did before this file
//     existed. Nothing is started and nothing is said about a judgement nobody
//     made.
//   - IT IS CHEAP WHERE IT IS BUSY AND DEAR WHERE IT DECIDES. RoleRouter sits
//     on the low tier (internal/roles) because it SCREENS: it is asked after
//     every substantial wordy turn, which is volume, and volume belongs on the
//     cheap model. A wrong no there still costs only a task that was never
//     started. A wrong YES is the one that changed when the card went away — it
//     now spends a task's money — so a yes is never taken from the cheap model
//     alone. It is put ONCE MORE, in the same words and a fresh context, on the
//     tier that thinks ([Agent.confirmRouteWork]), and only both-yes starts
//     anything. The confirm is asked on nothing else, so what it costs over a
//     conversation is nearly nothing and what it stands in front of is a whole
//     task's spend.
//   - IT NEVER STANDS IN FRONT OF A TURN. The post-turn read happens after the
//     answer is on the screen, so it can take the time it takes. The pre-turn one
//     used to be a DEADLINE on the first request — three seconds, and a judge
//     that had not answered by then was a no — and that is the shape this file
//     was rewritten to remove: the bound was tighter than the floor latency of
//     the model it bounded, so every call was issued, every call missed it, and a
//     whole cascade read as a silent no ([routeRaceWindow] carries the
//     measurement). It now RACES the turn instead: the question goes out on a
//     goroutine, the turn proceeds into the model on the same beat, and the
//     answer is spent at a step boundary or not at all. A no costs a person
//     nothing because a no is never waited for, and a yes costs the seconds
//     already spent — which are not lost, because they go with it as the dowry.

WORDS are a question, a discussion, advice, an opinion, a fact, an explanation, a plan somebody asked to read. SMALL WORK is words too, for this purpose: a few tool calls, one obvious edit, a file read and an answer. Handing small work off is slower than doing it, so it is not work.

WORK is research across several sources, changes across several files, a goal with several independent parts, or anything the person would otherwise watch a spinner for.

THE TEST IS THE CRITICAL PATH AND NOT THE SIZE. If the fastest correct answer runs through the assistant's own tools in a few calls, it is not work, however large the subject sounds. If it runs through minutes of them, or through parts somebody would otherwise serialize by hand, it is work.

A YES STARTS THE WORK IMMEDIATELY. One worker takes the goal you write and the person is told it started. Nobody is asked first, so answer yes only for work you would want begun on your behalf.

         DONE WHEN — the observable condition that says this is finished, in a
         sentence or two. Somebody ELSE checks it, and they are shown THIS
         SENTENCE ON ITS OWN: not the goal, not this conversation, not the
         worker's account of itself. So name the thing that must exist and the
         check that shows it — "every package under internal/ has been read and
         the report names each pricing bug with its file and line" — and never
         write "the goal is met" or "the task is complete", which give the
         checker nothing to look at.
  checks Optional. ONE simple command per entry that safely re-establishes the

         not be repeated. Omit checks when none are known or safe to repeat.

// impressed by, and a yes here takes the message OUT of the conversation rather
// than adding work beside an answer that was already given.
//
// THE CRITICAL-PATH LAW IS THE SAME LAW, word for word, because it is the thing
// that keeps both readings honest: small work is not work, and the fastest
// correct answer through a few tool calls is a conversation however grand the
// subject sounds.
//
// WHAT IS NEW IS THE THREE SHAPES A REQUEST WEARS. They are the pre-turn read's
// whole edge over the post-turn one: several independent deliverables named in
// one message, a sweep across many files or sources, and an answer somebody
// would otherwise sit and watch a spinner for. THEY ARE TAUGHT AS PRINCIPLES AND
// NEVER AS PATTERNS — there is no list of words, no count of numerals, nothing a
// person could defeat by phrasing a request differently — because a judge tuned
// to surface features is a keyword rule with a bill attached.
const routeAheadBrief = `You judge ONE message a person has just typed to a coding assistant, BEFORE it is answered. Nothing has been done yet: you are reading the REQUEST, not a reply. You decide one thing: is this WORK?

WORDS are a question, a discussion, advice, an opinion, a fact, an explanation, a plan somebody asked to read. SMALL WORK is words too, for this purpose: a few tool calls, one obvious edit, a file read and an answer. Handing small work off is slower than doing it, so it is not work.

WORK is research across several sources, changes across several files, a goal with several independent parts, or anything the person would otherwise watch a spinner for. Three shapes of request are almost always work: one message that asks for SEVERAL INDEPENDENT DELIVERABLES, a SWEEP across many files or many sources, and anything whose answer is MINUTES OF TOOL CALLS the person can only sit and watch.

THE TEST IS THE CRITICAL PATH AND NOT THE SIZE. If the fastest correct answer runs through the assistant's own tools in a few calls, it is not work, however large the subject sounds. If it runs through minutes of them, or through parts somebody would otherwise serialize by hand, it is work.

A YES STARTS THE WORK IMMEDIATELY AND THE CONVERSATION DOES NOT ANSWER THE MESSAGE. One worker is given this message and the goal you write, and the person is told it started rather than being replied to here. So answer yes only for a request you would rather have DONE than ANSWERED.

// ── what a yes starts ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// launchRouteTask admits one node from the judge's goal. IT IS THE ONLY LANDING
// out of this file, and it goes through the SAME door the model's own hands go
// through — the task graph's admission (task.go). Nothing new executes work
// here: a second way to start work is a second way for it to start differently.
//
// IT DOES NOT ASK. propose_task's countdown is the consent for work the MODEL
// groomed on its own, and this work was not groomed by anybody — it is the
// judge's reading of a sentence a person already typed. The question a card
// would put ("shall I?") is a question about work nobody has seen yet; the task
// answers it better by existing, on the rail, saying what it is doing and
// stoppable there. So the spec goes straight to [TaskGraph.admit], which is the
// same admission a countdown that ran out reaches.
//
// THE ACCEPTANCE IS THE JUDGE'S OWN DONE-CONDITION, written in the same call
// that wrote the goal ([routeVerdict.Acceptance]), and [routeAcceptance] stands
// in for it when the judge did not write one.
//
// IT HANDS BACK THE LINE IT SAID, AND THE NODE'S NUMBER. The post-turn caller has
// no use for the line — the person already has an answer on the screen and this
// note goes under it — but the pre-turn one ends the turn on this sentence and
// records it as the turn's answer ([Agent.routeAhead]), and a second copy of the
// wording assembled there would be the one that drifts. The number is what lets
// the checkpoint's own journal line name the task its ceiling started
// (checkpoint.go's [journalCeiling]); reading it back out of the line would be a
// number parsed out of a sentence written for a person.
//
// THE TITLE IS THE CALLER'S TO CHOOSE, and that is the one thing that is not the
// same on the two roads in. A goal a judge wrote is a sentence about the work and
// its front makes a serviceable name; a goal that is a MODEL'S CONTINUATION on a
// transcript full of tool calls is not, and has been measured opening with a
// provider's tool-call sentinel and with the closing remark of a finished answer
// (checkpoint.go). So the source is named at each call site rather than assumed
// here, and whatever arrives is put through the hand that cleans every other name
// on this surface ([routeTaskTitle]).
//
// AND IT CARRIES THE DIVISION A MARK ALREADY DREW, where a mark drew one. It is a
// PARAMETER and not a field on the verdict because the verdict is the judge's own
// vocabulary and no judge writes this: it is the second reader's drawing of what
// is left, taken at a checkpoint mark, and the spec is where it has to land so
// that the worker this admits can be started on it (task_divide_sketch.go). An
// empty one is every other door, and changes nothing.
//
// AND IT CARRIES THE NAME THE ROAD ASKED FOR AHEAD (taskname.go's [nameAhead]),
// which may be nil. One that has landed is the title from the first line a
// person reads, written as a name a model wrote so nothing renames it; one
// still in flight rides the spec, and the graph waits for it rather than asking
// again.
//
// IT STARTS ORDINARY WORK AND NOTHING ELSE. A quick node is never admitted here:
// every quick node on every road comes through [Agent.admitQuick], because the
// things this function decides — a done-condition, a place on the ground
// ladder, a name, a width to arm — are the things a quick node does not have.
