// The executor: a graph of work, a frontier, and one node's life inside a
// worktree.
//
// ── THE SHAPE IS A GRAPH, TODAY IT HOLDS ONE NODE ──
//
// [TaskGraph] is nodes and edges; [TaskGraph.runFrontier] is the whole
// scheduler. A node whose dependencies are all done is RUNNABLE; runnable nodes
// start until the concurrency cap is full and the rest wait on the frontier; a
// node that finishes unlocks its dependents and its report becomes part of
// their briefs. What v1 exercises is a graph of one node with no edges, and
// nothing here is written for that case: when decomposition lands it adds EDGES
// INTO THIS EXECUTOR, not a second machine, and the only thing that changes is
// that depends_on stops being empty.
//
// THE BRIEF IS ASSEMBLED WHEN THE NODE STARTS, not when it was proposed. That
// is the point of doing it here: a dependent's prerequisites have run by then,
// so what it is handed is its own brief plus what the work before it learned —
// facts that did not exist at proposal time.
//
// ── WHY A WORKTREE ──
//
// A node edits files while the person is editing files. Sharing a checkout
// would mean the node's half-finished sweep is what the person's `go build`
// compiles, and a node killed mid-edit would leave its wreckage in their tree.
// So each node gets `git worktree add` on a branch off the person's current
// HEAD: it works in a directory of its own, and the work comes home as a MERGE
// — clean, or a conflict that keeps the branch and says so. A workspace that is
// not a repository has no such isolation to offer, and the node runs in place
// rather than pretending (Merge is "inplace", and the person is told).
//
// ── A NODE STOPS BY A NAMED THRESHOLD, NEVER BY WANDERING ──
//
// Four things end a node's work, and every one of them has a name the person
// can read: its deadline, its step budget, its no-progress count, and a run of
// actions that produced nothing that was not already there
// (harness-research-notes.md §1 — Argus terminates on named thresholds rather
// than on a reviewer's judgement, arXiv:2608.05144). The fourth is the only one
// that does not end anything on its own: reaching it is what makes the harness
// ASK, with the count and the working copy in front of whoever is asked
// (effects.go). A node that has taken
// forty steps or has taken six in a row without changing a file is not working,
// it is circling, and the difference between a harness that says "stopped: 6
// steps without progress" and one that lets the thirty-minute deadline collect
// it is half an hour of the person's money and a report that explains nothing.
// Both thresholds are per-node overridable on the wire (task.go's max_steps and
// no_progress) because the right budget for a one-file rename and for a sweep
// across forty files is not the same number.
//
// ── AND IT IS NEVER THE NODE THAT SAYS IT IS DONE ──
//
// A finished run is a CLAIM. What turns it into TaskDone is an independent
// read-only auditor with hard evidence (task_audit.go): VERIFIED merges,
// REFUTED is a TaskFailed carrying the auditor's evidence, and the cascade
// below fails its dependents with it. Nothing in this file writes TaskDone off
// the child's own last words.
//
// And when the auditor gives NO verdict — twice, having been asked again — the
// node lands TaskUnverified: not done, not failed, branch kept, dependents
// waiting rather than cascading, until a person resolves it
// ([Agent.ResolveUnverified]). A false failure is still a failure, and this
// file must not manufacture one out of an audit that never happened.
//
// ── WHY A NODE NEVER ASKS ──
//
// There is nobody to ask. Its approval posture is composed from the same
// [approval.Policy] the conversation uses — allow everything, with the critical
// table (rm -rf /, mkfs, a redirect onto a raw disk, shutdown) still a floor
// under it — and where a conversation would raise a question, the node reads a
// refusal it can act on. That is exactly consent.go's law for a headless run,
// said in the node's own words.

	// what says a node is done, and a healthy node never meets either number.

	// Two hundred steps is liberal on purpose: a real task reads, builds, fixes

	// for it to run away.
	//
	// NEITHER IS WHAT DECIDES HOW WIDE WORK GOES, and until 2026-09-11 both were
	// written as though they were. Five children was a guess about decomposition
	// ("more than that has not decomposed its work, it has shredded it") and two
	// levels a guess about where a third stops paying, and nobody had measured
	// either. What actually bounds how much runs at once is the machine and the
	// work: the person's task.parallel holds a ready node until a slot frees,
	// the admission governor holds one while the machine is already loaded
	// (task_pressure.go, which weighs the machine once per frontier pass, so a
	// batch that becomes ready together is admitted on one reading), and two
	// parts that would write one file are refused (a division) or queued one
	// behind the other (quick tasks' file claims), not counted. Whether a worker
	// SHOULD split is the fan-out page's question (prompts/fanout.md) and the
	// division road's evidence gate (task_divide.go), each asked of the material
	// in front of it; a constant here cannot know the answer for work it has
	// never seen. The owner's ruling is that breadth may be large where the work
	// parallelises, because a node's parts cost the longest of them and not
	// their sum.
	//
	// SO THE FAN CAP IS A RUNAWAY STOP AND NOTHING ELSE. A node handing out more
	// than twenty pieces has lost the plot rather than found the width, and it
	// still has to fold every one of their reports into one deliverable. It is a
	// REFUSAL the model can read ([TaskGraph.claimChild]), not a queue, so the
	// answer to a twenty-first part is to do it in its own hands.
	//
	// THREE LEVELS lets a part of a wide job fan once more: the conversation's
	// task hands out its parts, and a part that opens its material and finds it
	// wide in turn may split its own share rather than grinding through it. The
	// floor is still absence and not refusal (task.go's [Config.mayFanOut]), and

// TaskNode is one piece of work: what it was admitted with, where it is in its
// life, and what it leaves behind.
//
// Every field below the mutex line is guarded by the GRAPH's lock, not one of
// its own. A node is never touched alone — starting one reads its dependencies'
// reports, finishing one unlocks its dependents — so a second lock would be a
// lock ordering to get wrong for no gain.
//
// ── THE GOAL CONTRACT: spec IS FROZEN AT ADMISSION ──
//
// NOTHING IN THIS FILE WRITES spec.request, spec.brief, spec.deliverable OR
// spec.acceptance AFTER admit — the four parts of what the node is told
// (task_brief.go). Not the frontier, not the runner, not the auditor, not a
// redirect that arrives late. The node's goal is settled the moment
// [TaskGraph.admit] takes it, and
// every reader downstream — the instruction the child is given, the acceptance
// the auditor judges against, the report a dependent inherits — reads THAT text
// and no other.
//
// This is Argus's two-tier goal contract (harness-research-notes.md §1,
// arXiv:2608.05144), and the two tiers are drawn exactly here: the semantic
// tier moves freely BEFORE admission — the model grooms the brief, the person
// redirects it and their words are appended (task.go) — and the precise
// objective moves only with authority, which in this surface means a NEW
// admission by the person. A redirect is not an edit to a running node; there
// is no path to one, and there must not be. The reason is the auditor: a
// frontier that verifies work against an acceptance which can move while the
// work runs verifies nothing, because whoever holds the pen can always make the
// work pass. What the person gets instead is honest — the running node lands
// against what it was given, and the correction is a task of its own.
//
// The only fields below that change after admission are the node's LIFE (state,
// started, cancel) and its LEAVINGS (brief, report, changed, branch, merge).
// brief is assembled once at start (runFrontier's JIT assembly) from spec.brief
// plus prerequisites' reports and is not the spec.

	// (loop.go runs a batch concurrently) would both read TaskUnverified and both

// taskNote is what the model reads when a node lands: the outcome, the report,

//
// THE WORD IS THE TIER'S WORD AND IT IS NOT SPELLED HERE. The model is about to
// tell a person what happened, in its own sentence, and a note that said one word
// while the card beside it said another is two accounts of one landing. So the
// head is read straight off [ProjectTask] — the same reading every row, rail and
// card draws — and there are four words it can be:
//
//	done         the gate let it through, and the report is the evidence it went
//	             through on
//	stopped      the person ended it, and nothing was found wrong with the work
//	incomplete   it did not finish, and the reason is on the head beside the word:
//	             the connection, the steps, the gaps the check named, a fault
//	your call    the machine has done what it can and somebody has to decide
//
// `failed` and `needs your look` have LEFT THIS NOTE. The first sent the model —
// and then the person — looking for a fault in work nobody had judged, and the
// second was one surface's private word for the state every other surface now
// calls your call (docs/design/task-states/DESIGN.md).
//
// NOT ONE OF THEM IS THE HARNESS'S OWN VOCABULARY. The model reads this line and
// says it back to a person in its own words, so "auditor", "verdict", VERIFIED
// and REFUTED must not be in it — the person asked for work, not for a trial,
// and a model handed a courtroom will hold one (task_audit.go's vocabulary law).
// The one word here that comes from the machinery is `reaudit`, and it is there
// because the model has to TYPE it back: a handle is an address, not a finding.
//
// THE TRANSCRIPT URI RIDES THE FIRST LINE, when the node has a journal to point
// at. It is the same handle the `tasks` tool hands out for a node somebody wants
// to read for themselves (task_index.go's TranscriptURI), and it is here so the
// model can hand it over — or read it — without first going looking for the
// row. Empty for a node whose journal this session no longer knows, and then
// the line simply ends after the title.
//
// THE SETTLE POLICY CHANGES ONE CLAUSE AND NOTHING ELSE ([settleClause]). Under
// `ask` the note is informational — the person has the decision on the card in
// front of them, and the model's job is to say what it thinks. Under `auto` the
// same note becomes an instruction to read the work and settle it. Every other
// line of every other landing is identical either way, because the policy is
// about who decides and not about what happened.
// settlePolicy is this agent's standing answer to "who decides a landing nobody
// could check" (task_contract.go's [TaskSettle]). A blank row reads as asking,
// which is the default and the only safe reading of a caller that said nothing.
//
// EXCEPT THAT A LADDER MAY NOT END IN A PERSON WHO IS NOT THERE.
//
// [Config.AskConsent] is this build's one notion of "somebody is watching this
// session and will answer" — it is what an interactive surface sets and what
// `--once` and every other headless door deliberately leaves false. Where it is
// false there is no card to press `[d] decide these for me` on, no settings
// panel to turn `task.settle` to auto in, and nobody to read a landing that says
// it is waiting on them. A node that landed needing a look in such a session is
// a run that has stopped, and it was measured stopping: on a ten-hour benchmark
// the main task landed as the person's call and the harness sat there
// until the wall clock ran out.
//
// So an unattended session reads as AUTO, which is not a bypass and not a new
// road: it is the same [TaskSettleAuto] the person's own "decide these for me"
// button sets (internal/tui3's settleAlways), reached by the same landing note,
// answered by the same `tasks … resolve` verb, with the same standing escape —
// the auto note tells the model to come back to the person when it genuinely
// cannot tell. What changes is only who is asked FIRST, which is all this policy
// has ever changed.
//
// IT NEVER GOES THE OTHER WAY. A session somebody IS watching keeps the row they
// set, and a blank row still reads as asking: a build that started deciding on
// behalf of a person who is sitting right there would be the opposite defect.

// never be verified, never merged, and could only read as a failure.

// SO IT ENDS WHERE [Agent.landShifted] ENDS: the person's call, the branch kept
// with the work committed on it, the conflicting files named in the report. The
// person's tree is untouched — no markers, no half-merge ([abandonMerge]) — and
// merging is a thing they do when they are ready, which is what the completion

// taughtSomething reports whether one call advanced the node's KNOWLEDGE: a
// knowledge tool, or a bash, whose RESULT was MORE NEW THAN OLD to this node —
// measured line by line, over the lines it has already been shown (novelty.go).
//
// ── PROGRESS IS INFORMATION, NEVER ACTIVITY ──
//
// This used to ask whether the CALL was new — a target the node had not aimed at
// before — and the difference between the two questions was measured at nine
// wasted polls in a row. A model waiting on a background job wrote
// `sleep 30 && tail jobs/1.log`, then `sleep 45 && tail jobs/1.log`, then
// `sleep 60 && …`: nine distinct command strings, nine identical `(no output)`
// answers, and every one of them reset the no-progress counter, because typing a
// different number is activity and the counter was measuring activity. The node
// learned nothing nine times and the one mechanism built to notice that told it
// it was doing well.
//
// So the key is the RESULT and not the call. A new command whose answer the node
// has already been given is not a discovery; the same command run twice with a
// different answer IS one, which is the honest reading of `go test` after an
// edit. SUCCESS is still not required — a new failure is new information — and
// the seen map still keys per node, so one node's discoveries say nothing about
// another's.
//
// BASH IS BOTH HANDS and is admitted here on the knowledge half alone. `go
// build` writes, `go test ./...`, `git log` and `rg` do not, and the tool name
// says nothing about which one this was — so a command whose output the node has
// never read counts as the world answering a question it has never asked, and
// the writing half of the same call is answered by the worktree, one caller up
// ([childRun.batchMoved]), which asks it of the batch rather than of this hand.
//
// It RECORDS AS IT ANSWERS, so the caller must ask it on every step and never
// behind a short-circuit: a result that was already progress for some other
// reason must not also be spendable as a fresh one the next time it comes back.
//
// THE TOOL NAME STAYS IN THE KEY. Two different hands that happen to answer the
// same bytes — an `ls` and a `bash ls` — are two ways of learning the same
// thing, and only the second of them is a spin.
//
// AND A RESULT THE HARNESS WROTE IS NOT THE WORLD ANSWERING. A withdrawn hand
// and a refused door (withdrawn.go's [Event.HarnessMade]) are neither progress
// nor a spin, which the caller's own reading already has right — this returns
// early so that those bytes are not remembered EITHER, because a sentence this
// side of the wall wrote must not be able to make a later, real result look

// The batch is one call because the ordinary node writes a handful of files. It
// falls back to one call per path ([unstagedWork]) because a single path git

// PROVIDER having failed this node, rather than anything about the work.
//
// The distinction is what keeps this from becoming a second audit. A tool that
// failed never reaches here at all — a failed call is a result the worker reads
// and goes on from, and only a turn that could not be completed ends a run. Work
// that is merely incomplete does not reach here either: that is a finished
// worker with a thin claim, and whether it holds is task_audit.go's question and
// nobody else's. What is left is the shape this answers — a refusal, an account
// limit, an exhausted set of retries against a provider that would not serve
// this model — and none of those says one word about the brief.
//
// TWO ARE DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED:
//
//   - A CUT THE TURN ALREADY ANSWERED. A stream cut over and over has already
//     walked the fallback chain inside the turn that died (loop.go), so the
//     first model this would move to is the model that just failed there. A
//     whole second worker to re-learn that is the most expensive way to find out
//     nothing.
//   - A CONTEXT OVERFLOW, which is a fact about the transcript. The answer to it
//     is a shorter conversation, which the turn loop already tries; another
