// ErrTurnInFlight refuses a rewind while the session is working. Rewinding
// under a running turn would cut the transcript the turn is mid-way through
// writing: the loop holds message indices across a provider call (a compaction
// pass holds one for the whole summary), and a truncation underneath it turns
// an append-only invariant into a slice out of range.
//
// It is a refusal rather than a wait because a rewind is a person saying "not
// that" about work they can see. Making them wait for the work they are
// cancelling to finish first would be the wrong shape; interrupting first and
// rewinding after is the right one, and it is one keystroke.
var ErrTurnInFlight = errors.New("session: a turn is in flight; interrupt it first")

// ErrNothingToRewind says there is no turn to drop: a session that has not been
// spoken to yet, or one whose entire transcript is a compaction summary. It is a
// sentinel so the surface can say so in the person's words instead of reporting
// a success that removed nothing.
var ErrNothingToRewind = errors.New("session: nothing to rewind")

// Rewind drops the last thing the person said and everything that followed it —
// the whole turn it started: the assistant's replies, its tool calls, and the
// results those calls returned. It reports what it removed, oldest first, in the
// same display shape [Agent.Transcript] uses, so a surface can un-draw exactly
// the rows it drew.
//
// It is an edit of the CONVERSATION, not of the workspace. Files the dropped
// turn wrote stay written and commands it ran stay run: this makes the model
// stop having been told something, which is what a person means when they take
// back a badly-phrased instruction and type a better one. Nothing pretends the
// work did not happen.
//
// Both the live transcript and the session file are rewound. The file is
// append-only, so the cut is journaled as a marker rather than by rewriting
// history: a {"type":"rewind","dropped":N} line, which a replay applies by
// dropping the N messages it had accumulated when it reached the line. The count
// travels in the marker so that a session which rewinds and then keeps working
// resumes as itself — everything after the marker is ordinary conversation and
// is replayed as such.
//
// It is now the special case of [Agent.RewindAt]: the last Turn point in
// [Agent.RewindPoints], which is the newest place in the conversation the person
// said something. It keeps its own door because it is the rewind that needs no
// picker — one keystroke for "not that, let me say it again" — but it no longer
// keeps its own cutting path. THERE IS ONE CUT IN THIS PACKAGE, and every door
// onto it only chooses where to put it.

// Turn is a step boundary inside a turn (after a tool result or an assistant
// reply). Said carries the person's words at a Turn cut, for the surface to

//
// A TURN POINT IS A USER-ROLE MESSAGE, which is where a rewind usually wants to
// land: it takes back what was said and everything the saying caused. Index 0 is
// the system message and is never a cut, and a compaction note never appears at
// all — it is context this package handed to the model rather than something
// anybody said, and cutting to it would drop a whole resumed conversation while
// leaving the summary that replaced its beginning. Both exclusions are the ones
// [Agent.lastTurnStartLocked] already makes; the note is recognized by the
// marker [foldMarker] writes, not by guessing at its wording.
//
// A STEP POINT IS ANY OTHER MESSAGE BOUNDARY: after an assistant reply, after a
// tool result. These are the cuts inside a turn, for a person who wants to keep
// the instruction and drop only the last thing the model did with it.
//
// THE LAW A BOUNDARY MUST OBEY: A CUT MAY NOT SEPARATE A TOOL CALL FROM ITS
// ANSWER. A retained assistant message whose calls were answered in the dropped
// tail is a transcript no provider will take — the call is still there, asking
// for a result that no longer exists — so those boundaries are left OUT of the
// list rather than repaired at cut time. The alternative, stripping the dangling
// calls from the retained message, was rejected on two counts. It would make the
// live transcript say the model never made a call that it really did make, which
// is a lie about the past that this package refuses everywhere else — a rewind
// is an edit of the CONVERSATION and never a claim that the work did not happen.
// And it could not survive a resume: the journal is append-only and its rewind
// marker is a COUNT of messages dropped from the tail (sessionfile.go), so there
// is no way to journal a mutation of a message that is being KEPT. A cut only
// ever drops a tail, in memory and in the file alike, and the points list is
// exactly the set of tails that can be dropped.
//
// Note that the law is about what the cut CREATES, not about what it inherits. A
// call that was never answered anywhere — an interrupt that landed between a
// batch and its results — is dangling before the cut and after it, and no choice
// of cut point mends or worsens it. Only a call whose answer sits on the far
// side of the cut disqualifies a boundary.
