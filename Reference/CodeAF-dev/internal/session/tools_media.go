// tools_media.go is what the three MAKING verbs share — generate_image
// (tools_image.go), speak (tools_speak.go) and generate_video (tools_video.go).
//
// Each of them asks the same three questions and must answer them the same way,
// which is why the answers are here and not copied into three files:
//
//   - IS THIS VERB ON THE BELT AT ALL? [Agent.mediaHand] is the absence law in
//     one call. A nil Media is no hand; a resolver that answers "" for the
//     modality is a hand with nothing to ask for. Either way the tool is left
//     OFF rather than added and made to refuse (tools_search.go states the law
//     at length).
//
//   - WHAT DOES A REFERENCE PATH MEAN? A picture the model points at is read off
//     the disk and encoded as a data URL, exactly as internal/exec/media.go's
//     leaf tools do it, with the same five formats and the same 10MB ceiling the
//     rest of this binary enforces (image.go). One vocabulary for "which
//     pictures can be used", wherever a picture is handed in.
//
//   - WHERE DO THE BYTES LAND? [Agent.mediaDestination] is one collision-safe
//     naming rule for every modality: a path the model gave, or a timestamp, a
//     slug of the prompt, and a suffix if that name is already taken.
