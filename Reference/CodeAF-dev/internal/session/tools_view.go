// view_image: the model's own eyes on a file, through the looking slot.
//
// Everything else on this belt reads TEXT. A picture reached the conversation
// one way only — a person attached it — which left the model unable to check
// the screenshot it just told a person to take, unable to look at the diagram it
// just generated, and unable to say anything about a photograph sitting in the
// workspace beyond its size in bytes. A task node, which has no person in front
// of it at all, could never look at anything.
//
// So looking becomes a verb. It is ONE SHOT AND ONE ANSWER, exactly as the
// vision fallback is (image.go): the looking model is sent the picture and the
// question and NOTHING ELSE — no system prompt, no transcript, no tools — and
// what comes back is the tool's result. The bytes go to that model and are never
// recorded, which is the same law the fallback keeps and for the same reason: a
// data URL in this transcript is a data URL re-sent on every step of every turn
// afterwards, and the model calling this tool is usually the one that cannot
// read it anyway.
//
// IT RESOLVES THROUGH THE SAME SLOT AS EVERYTHING ELSE. The seer is
// [Agent.visionSeer] — the settings sheet's looking slot, then the role pin,
// then the catalog — so "can I see" has one answer whether it is asked by an
// attached picture, by read_document's image rung, or by this tool
// (docs/MULTIMODAL.md, Decision 8).
//
// AND A BELT WITH NO EYES HAS NO VERB. When nothing resolves, the tool is left
// off entirely rather than added and made to refuse every time it is called —
// the design law tools_search.go and tools_image.go both state, and the reason
// it matters here is that a model told it can look at pictures plans around
// looking at them for the rest of the conversation.

// viewImageDefaultQuestion is what is asked of a picture when the caller asked
// nothing. It is internal/exec/media.go's, word for word, because a model that
// looks at a screenshot from a task node and one that looks at it from a
// conversation should get the same kind of answer — and because "describe this
// image" alone comes back as a caption where the caller wanted the text on the
// error dialog.

// THE LOOK'S WINDOW IS NOT THIS FILE'S ANY MORE. It was `viewLookWindow`, set

// dispatcher already derives from the call's role. It is now [toolAskWindow],
// which every tool-made model call on this belt shares and which comes out of
// [lane.Role.GiveUp] rather than out of a constant anybody typed.

// The description TEACHES, by Decision 8: capability is not something a model
// should discover by failing. It names the uses that are otherwise invisible —
// the screenshot, the rendered page, the picture this session made itself — the
// question that focuses the look, and the fact that the answer comes from
// another model and says so.

This is how you check a screenshot, examine a page or chart you rendered to a picture, read a photograph of a document, or look at an image you generated a moment ago to see whether it came out right. Ask a question to point the look where you need it — \"what does the error dialog say?\", \"is the legend cut off?\", \"how many rows are in this table?\" — or leave it out for a full description. Reads png, jpeg, webp and gif up to 10MB. The picture is looked at once, by the model this session uses for looking, and the answer names it; the image itself is not added to this conversation, so ask everything you need about a picture in one call."

//
// The seer is resolved HERE, at belt time, because presence is the decision it
// makes — and again at call time, because the person can change the looking slot
// mid-conversation and the resolver is the truth at the moment of use. The
// belt-time answer is what a call falls back to when the resolver has since gone
// quiet: a tool the model has been promised should look with the model it was
// promised rather than refuse.
