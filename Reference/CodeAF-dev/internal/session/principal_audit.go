// THE TERMINAL AUDIT: the last thing an unattended session does before it is
// allowed to say the ask is finished.
//
// ── WHAT WAS MISSING ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every reading this engine takes of "is it done" is a reading of what the
// SESSION SAID. The mark reader is shown a digest of the transcript; a task's
// auditor is shown that node's own acceptance and that node's own claim. Nobody
// ever looked at the tree afterwards, and nobody ever looked at what the session
// had left lying around it. Two measured runs held a good result and were
// zeroed at the end by scratch data files the session had written beside the
// deliverable and never picked up; a third ended on a tree that did not build,
// with the conversation confidently finished.
//
// So a Steward gets two readings a person would have taken for themselves:
//
//   - THE CHECKS THE WORK ITSELF NAMED, READ FROM CLEAN. Not a list this file
//     knows — task_checks.go already settled that law, and the same
//     [auditDoorFor] contract is used here so a session and its nodes can never
//     disagree about what a check is. "From clean" means A FRESH PROCESS IN THE
//     DELIVERABLE TREE: no shell the turn had open, no environment a tool call
//     had edited, nothing cached from the run. It is what a person typing the
//     command in a new terminal would get. An answer already taken over the
//     same unchanged tree is that reading and is reused rather than paid for
//     again.
//
//   - AND A RECONCILIATION OF EVERYTHING THE SESSION CREATED. Every path is
//     either inside the deliverable tree — where it is part of the answer — or
//     it is scratch, and scratch is removed and written down.
//
// ── THE LAW THIS FILE MUST NOT BREAK ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// NOTHING THE SESSION DID NOT CREATE IS EVER TOUCHED. Not a file it modified,
// not a file it read, not a directory it happened to write into. The ledger
// this walks holds only paths whose non-existence was MEASURED before the call
// that made them (recovery.go's [fileLedger] takes that measurement, and it is
// the only moment it can be taken); a path with no such measurement is recorded
// as modified and never reaches here.
//
// AND A PERSON'S SESSION DELETES NOTHING. [Person] is offered the list and that
// is all: somebody who is sitting there can see their own directory, and a
// harness quietly removing files behind them is the opposite of what the
// emptiness of that implementation means everywhere else.

// that has to merge into a ground holding uncommitted work sets that work aside
// with `git stash push` and puts it back on every road out of there
// ([taskTree.carryGroundWork]). The window is short and every road pops, but a
// terminal reading taken inside it would see the harness's own entry and answer
// carry on over a finished run. They are told apart by the message the push
// itself was given — [groundStashMessage], reused rather than copied, so a
// respelling cannot make this quietly stop matching.
//
// AND WITH NO BEFORE-READING, NOTHING IS COUNTED. Nobody then knows which

//   - `git stash push -m <message>` writes the subject `On <branch>: <message>`,

//     quietly stop matching. The branch name is that message's tail and is not
//     known here.

// mean opposite things, and a before-reading that failed read as an empty one
// would have every ignored file the run later found counting as its own.
//
// THE REPOSITORY'S OWN ANSWER IS THE ONE THAT COUNTS, because the person has
// already written it down: `.gitignore` says what the project considers not
// its own, and `git status --porcelain --ignored` is the one reading that
// lists what the project does not claim AND THE DISK HOLDS — the gap between
// [treeRecordFromGit] and the tree. Its paths are spelled relative to the
// REPOSITORY ROOT whatever directory the command stood in (measured), so each
// is joined to the root and only the ones inside the deliverable tree are
// kept, spelled as a person in the tree reads them ([treeRelative]). A
// gitignored file a sibling directory of the workspace holds is not the
// landing's surroundings, and naming it would be a sentence about a tree
// nobody delivered.
//
// THE ROOT COMES FROM [repositoryRoot], THE ONE ASKER OF THE GROUND QUESTION,
// and its refusal is this reading's own law with it: a deliverable tree that
// is a scratch directory inside somebody's checkout is asked nothing, because
// discovering the checkout is the one thing this package must never do
// ([climbsOutOfScratch]). A tree that is not itself a repository gets silence,
// the same answer a tree with no git gets.

// be built on: a file name may hold any byte a quoted spelling would mangle.
//
// The entries are individual files where the project's own patterns cover

// ── THE MEASURED FAILURE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The attrs cell's acceptance was "the existing test suite passes (run
// `tox -e py`)" over a suite that had one failing test before anybody touched
// anything. That sentence could never come true, so the goal owner read the
// project's own red as work still to do and carried the run on into it until the
// wall. A run cannot be asked to finish something that was not started.
//
// ── WHY HERE, AND NOT AT THE FIRST WRITE ────────────────────────────────────
//
// The first write is the other candidate and it is the wrong one: the write seam
// learns that a call wrote at POST-FEEDBACK, which is after the file changed, and
// a reading taken then already holds this session's own work. What a baseline has
// to be is the tree BEFORE, and the only moment that is certainly before is the
// one this shares with [Agent.openAcceptance] — the start of the first turn.
//
// ── AND IT DOES NOT HOLD THE TURN, WHICH IS THE HALF THAT HAD TO CHANGE ─────
//
// A declared check is an ARBITRARY SHELL COMMAND. Run in front of the person's
// first turn it can take as long as a suite takes, and several of them in a row
// can take several suites — so it runs on its own and the turn starts. Until it
// lands there is no baseline, and what a reading with no baseline does is count
// NOTHING as this run's own red ([Remains.BaselineRead]): naming a check before
// anybody knows whether it was already failing is the exact mistake this exists
// to stop, in a hurry.
//
// AND THE WHOLE READING SHARES ONE WINDOW ([sessionCheckWindow]), not one each. A
// baseline is a photograph and a photograph has an exposure; four checks with
// five minutes apiece would be twenty minutes of somebody else's suite running
// beside a run that is already going. What does not fit is simply not read.
//
// AND A CHECK THAT CHANGED THE TREE IS NOT A BASELINE. A declared "check" can
// build, format, migrate or install; run before the work it would be this
// session's own first edit, made by the harness, and its answer would be a
// reading of a tree nobody asked for. The tree is photographed either side of
// each one ([verify.TreeState]) and a check that moved it has its result thrown

// and the reading was thrown away — leaving a baseline that said nothing was
// already failing over a project with 85 pre-existing failures (#513).
//
// THE REPOSITORY'S OWN ANSWER IS THE ONE THAT COUNTS, because the person has
// already written it down. Where the tree is a git worktree, the record is what
// `ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard` lists: everything tracked, plus

//
// AND WHERE THERE IS NO REPOSITORY, [verify.SkipTree] IS THE WHOLE RULE — the

// build directory or a cache with no dot in its name is a change here, and a
