// THE HARNESS QUESTION: the moment between "somebody said something" and "the
// model was sent it".
//
// A sub-harness has no slash command (docs/SUBHARNESS.md). If running one
// required typing its name, the registry would be a menu, and a menu is a thing
// people forget they have — the harness that exists to do research properly
// would sit unused beside a turn doing research badly. So the turn itself is the
// trigger: what a person said is matched against the registry, and a strong
// match raises ONE line asking whether they meant it.
//
// Three laws hold this to something a person can live with.
//
//   - IT IS A QUESTION, NEVER A ROUTING. Nothing runs because a matcher said so.
//     A harness runs because somebody said yes to a card that named it, and the
//     answer that costs nothing — no — leaves an ordinary turn behind, already
//     recorded, already about to be sent. Detection cannot lose a turn.
//   - IT IS ASKED ONCE PER TURN, HERE, before the first request. Not per step,
//     not per tool call: a question that could arrive mid-turn would be a
//     question about a sentence the model has already half-answered.
//   - IT IS SILENT WHEN NOBODY IS WATCHING. No registry, no runner, or no
//     surface that answers questions (Config.AskConsent) and this file does
//     nothing at all — not one extra branch a person can observe, and not one
//     turn that behaves differently than it did before any of this existed.
//     That is the same law consent.go keeps for the same reason: a headless run
//     must never block on a question nobody will ever be shown.
//
// The scoring is [subharness.Score] and it is deliberately dull: a table lookup
// over the designer's own cue list, pure, deterministic, no model call. That
// package says why at length.

// ── WHICH MODEL A RUN RIDES, WHEN THE TURN SAID SO ──────────────────────────
//
// A harness offer is raised by what somebody said, so the model one runs on is
// chosen the same way: "research the pricing tiers with opus" is one sentence
// carrying two decisions, and the second one is a clause at the end of it. This
// is the same bargain propose_task already keeps (taskmodel.go) and it shares
// that file's matcher outright, so a word that means one model to a task means
// the same model here.
//
// THREE RULES HOLD IT TO SOMETHING THAT CANNOT COST A PERSON A TURN.
//
//   - IT IS READ AT THE END, AND ONLY THERE. A trailing "with|using|via <word>"
//     is how a person hangs an aside off a sentence they already finished. The
//     same words in the middle are ordinary English — "find out what broke with
//     the new parser" chooses no model — and reading them would turn every
//     sentence into a place a model name could hide.
//   - A CLAUSE THAT NAMED NO MODEL IS LEFT WHERE IT WAS. The text is stripped
//     for scoring and for the runner only when the word RESOLVED. A word that
//     matched nothing was, on the evidence, not a model at all, and cutting it
//     off the turn would hand the harness half a sentence on the strength of a
//     guess.
//   - IT IS NEVER A REFUSAL. A model nobody here carries leaves the offer
//     standing and says so on the card, because the person asked for a harness
//     and the model was the smaller half of what they said.
const (
	// harnessModelWords bounds the clause. A model is one word — "opus",
