package session

// THE TESTS DO NOT WRITE INTO THE DEVELOPER'S HOME.
//
// A test that runs a task runs a real agent, and a real agent journals what it
// did. That journal's directory resolves from the state root (internal/home),
// and the state root is the one thing a t.TempDir() cannot move: a test could
// hand the session a temporary workspace, a temporary Place and a temporary
// session file, and the node's transcript would still land in the person's own
// ~/.codeaf/v3/tasks. One run of this package left 183 files across 40 hash
// directories there, every one of them a session line pointing at a t.TempDir()
// that no longer existed.
//
// So the package moves HOME, and only HOME, for the whole run.
//
// IT MOVES HOME AND NOT CODEAF_HOME, which looks like the long way round and is
// not. CODEAF_HOME outranks HOME, so setting it here would have overruled every
// test that already does t.Setenv("HOME", t.TempDir()) for isolation of its own
// — the careful tests — and collapsed their separate state roots back into one
// shared directory. Node journals are named to the second, so a shared root is
// a shared file: the second agent to ask for tasks/unfiled/<stamp>_1.jsonl gets
// handed the first one's transcript, and resumes it. Moving HOME leaves each of
// those tests exactly the root it asked for, one level below the developer's.
//
// CODEAF_HOME is cleared for the same reason it is not set: a developer who
// exports it has pointed the state root at a real directory of their own, and
// it would win over everything here.
//
// Nothing about production changes. A real session still resolves ~/.codeaf,
// because nothing outside this file touches either variable.
//
// And then the guard, because moving HOME only covers what reads HOME. The run
// ends by looking at the real state root's journal trees and failing if they
// grew, which is how the next path resolved from somewhere clever gets caught
// on the day it is written instead of a hundred and eighty files later.

	// something that is not there is an error rather than a quiet fall back to
	// PATH — so this is the whole of "no furrow here".

	// landings, its auditor, its own task tree — and they said so by saying
	// nothing, because the default used to agree with them. When the default
	// moved they did not become wrong, they became silent about which road they
	// meant, and a hundred and forty of them changed what they were testing
	// without one line of them changing.
	//
	// So the road they were written for is named here rather than a hundred and
	// forty times, and a test that means the harness says so with
	// t.Setenv(..., "bash"), which outranks this for that test and is restored
	// on the way out. Every harness test in this package already does.
	//
	// THIS IS NOT A PIN THAT MAKES THE DEFAULT UNTESTED. The harness road has
	// its own suites and they run on the real default: internal/run,
	// internal/plandb, and this package's own bashbelt, plandb and land_run
	// files. What is pinned here is the older engine's suite, which is the only
