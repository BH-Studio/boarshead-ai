// THE PERSON STEERING FROM THE MAIN CHAT, WITH THEIR OWN AUTHORITY.
//
// A person watching three tasks run does not open three rooms. They say "make
// task 1 write CSV instead" in the conversation they are already in, and until
// this file existed the best the model could do was `tasks … say`, which is
// coordination: it is framed as another agent speaking, it is refused as a basis
// for a revision, and the worker is told in as many words that it grants nothing
// (task_room.go's [Agent.relayToTask], assignment.go's authority note). So the
// correction arrived as a paraphrase with no standing, the done-condition did
// not move, and the checker went on grading the work against the thing the
// person had just changed their mind about.
//
// ── WHAT THIS DOOR IS, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO BE ──
//
// It forwards THE PERSON'S RECORDED WORDS, verbatim, to ONE task the model
// names. The model chooses the address and nothing else: it does not write the
// words, it cannot edit them, and it cannot label anything of its own as theirs.
// [Agent.personAsk] is the text — the same words a task admitted in this turn
// would be handed as the person's own request — and the model's own sentence is
// still `say`, still framed as this conversation speaking.
//
// THAT SPLIT IS THE WHOLE SAFETY PROPERTY. A model that could supply the text
// could grant itself permissions by quoting a person who never said it; a model
// that can only supply an ADDRESS can, at worst, send the person's real words to
// the wrong task — which is a mistake the person can read, in their own
// sentence, on the task's own record. This file makes no claim to have
// understood who they meant, and the receipt the model gets back says so.
//
// ── WHICH MESSAGE, AND WHOSE TURN ──
//
// The source is bound to THE REQUEST THE MODEL IS ANSWERING and never to
// whatever the session holds at the moment the tool runs
// ([episode.decisionBegins] stamps it, and this file reads it back off the
// context). Two things follow, and both matter:
//
//   - A steer typed while a call is in flight cannot be forwarded by that call.
//     The words it carries are the ones the model actually read; the newer line
//     reaches the model at the next drain and is forwarded, if it should be, by
//     a call that has seen it.
//   - A turn nobody typed into has no source at all. A turn opened by a task
//     landing or a job exiting is answering the harness, not the person
//     ([Agent.personHeard]), and their words from two turns ago are not a live
//     instruction to hand a worker under their authority. The door refuses, and
//     names the reason.
//
// There is no second authority system here: the request generation is the
// [requestEpoch] the handoff gate already reads, the message identity is the
// [personTurn] sequence admission already numbers, and what the words become on
// the far side is the direction receipt every steer already mints.
//
// ── TWO DOORS OF DIFFERENT SPEEDS, AND WHAT IS ACTUALLY GUARANTEED ──
//
// A task can now hear the person twice over: from its own room, the instant they
// press enter, and from here, whenever the model gets round to it. So their
// words can reach one node OUT OF THE ORDER THEY SAID THEM — say A here, walk
// into the room and say B, and A can arrive second. What that must never buy is
// A moving the goal back over B.
//
// The guarantee is exactly this: WHAT THE WORK IS JUDGED BY MOVES IN THE ORDER
// THE SESSION HEARD EACH MESSAGE, whichever door it came through. A forwarded
// line carries its original drain timestamp rather than its forwarding time, and a revision citing a direction said before the one already in
// force is refused (assignment.go's [taskAssignment.lastSpokenApplied]).
//
// It is NOT a guarantee that a late line is never delivered. A forward whose
// message this task has not heard is delivered whenever it arrives, because it
// is genuinely theirs and nothing else has spoken for it — the worker reads it,
// with the harness's line under it, and cannot fold it in over anything later.
// The narrower case where this door DOES refuse is the one it can be certain
// about: a message this same conversation has already been overtaken on, where
// both sentences carry comparable identities from the same life.
//
// ── AND IT IS NOT A ROUTER ──
//
// One session, one target, named by id, resolved in this session's own graph
// through the same lookup every other op on the tool uses. No broadcast, no
// fan-out, nothing addressed to another window's work, and nothing a WORKER can
// call: a node forwarding "the person's words" would be a descendant minting the
// authority it is graded by, which is the one thing the origin model exists to
// prevent.

// (admission_compile.go's [personTurn]).

// THE TURN IT WAS MADE IN CAN BE OVER: interrupted, abandoned, closed, or

// sending it would put words the person has walked away from onto a running
// task under their name. It is refused here, out loud — a call that quietly did
// nothing and answered as though it had is the worse failure of the two.
//
// AND THAT CHECK IS A CHECK AND NOT A LINEARIZATION POINT. It reads the agent
// under a.mu and releases it before the delivery, so a turn that ends in the
// instant BETWEEN the two still delivers. Closing that window would mean holding
// a.mu across the graph and room locks the delivery takes, and this package's
// lock order runs the other way — a room's lock is taken before an agent's
// (mailbox.go) — so the strict version is a deadlock rather than a guarantee.
// What is left in that window is what the person's own room door has always had:
// a line typed as a turn ends is delivered, is on the node's record, and is
// answered by the landing's revalidation rather than by a promise made here.
//
// AND A LATER MESSAGE OF THEIRS CAN HAVE REACHED THIS TASK FIRST. That is the
// ordering hazard, and carrying the older words rather than the newer ones does
// not answer it: the direction ids this node mints are its own arrival order, so
// an older correction admitted after a newer one would hold the HIGHER id and a
// worker citing it would move the goal back to what the person has already
// changed their mind about — and the newer direction, now the lower id, would
// be refused as stale by [taskAssignment.revise]. So the record's own
// chronology decides ([taskAssignment.hear], under the graph lock that mints
// the receipt), and an older message arriving late is refused rather than
// admitted behind the newer one.
//
// WHAT IS NOT REFUSED is a call whose source has merely been SUPERSEDED IN THE
// SESSION — the person typed something else while this call was in flight, about
// anything at all. Those words are still theirs and still unsent, the model read
// them and chose this task for them, and the newer line reaches the model at the
