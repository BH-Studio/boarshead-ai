// THE REPAIR LOOP, THE LADDER, AND THE WORDS A PERSON READS.
//
// Three laws are exercised here and they are three separate files' worth of
// behaviour meeting at one node (task_audit.go):
//
//   - work that came back short is HANDED BACK — same worktree, fresh worker,
//     the gaps in front of it — and lands on the next answer;
//   - an auditor that stopped one word short is NUDGED before anybody pays for
//     a second investigation;
//   - and none of the machinery's vocabulary reaches the person or the chat
//     model, on any path.
//
// The end-to-end tests drive the real executor over a real git repository and a
// real `go test`, for the reason the audit tests do: "it was repaired in the
// same working copy and then it merged" is not a claim a stub can make.
