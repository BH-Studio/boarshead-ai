// A LANDING THAT COULD NOT SAVE THE WORK, AS TESTS (issues #255 and #256).
//
// Both defects were one shape: the failing road and the succeeding road answered
// the same outcome, so every caller read "done" off a landing that had saved
// nothing. On a repository ground the node's commit was thrown away, an empty
// branch merged cleanly, and the working copy holding the only copy of the work
// was removed — the file was gone from both places. On a folder ground the copy
// stopped at the first path it could not place, leaving the person's folder with
// half a deliverable under a row that read finished.
//
// So every test here asserts the same thing about a landing that failed: THE
// WORK IS STILL THERE, and the person is told where. What the node then SAYS
// depends on which failure it was — a conflict about the work goes back to
// somebody to decide, and a tree that would not take the work is settled where
// it stands rather than asked about again (task_land_unsaved.go's [treeRefused],
// #513).
