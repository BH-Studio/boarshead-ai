package session

// A BACKGROUND JOB IS A ROW ON THE ROSTER WHILE IT LIVES.
//
// THE LAW THIS FILE EXISTS FOR: work this conversation started shows on the
// right, whatever door started it. Until this file, one door broke it. A person
// asked for a multi-part sweep, the model started it with `bash background:true`
// and narrated it as a research run, and the column beside the conversation
// stayed completely empty for the whole nine minutes — because a job lives in
// the registry (jobs.go) and the registry had no way to say so to anybody but
// the `jobs` tool. From the person's side a session that was working and a
// session that had quietly given up looked identical.
//
// SO A JOB PUBLISHES A ROW, THROUGH THE ONE ROSTER DOOR EVERYTHING ELSE USES.
// There is no second row-space and no second lane: a live job's row is a
// [TaskNotice] of [TaskKindJob] on [Agent.emitTaskUpdate], which is what a task
// node and an adaptive run's family both publish. A surface that draws the
// roster draws jobs the day it is rebuilt against this package and needs to know
// nothing new to do it.
//
// IT REGISTERS AND IT DOES NOT ADMIT, which is orchestrate.go's phrase for
// exactly this shape. Nothing here calls [TaskGraph.admit] — admission is what
// STARTS work, and a job is already running in a registry of its own. What is
// reused is the RECORD-ROW SEAM an adaptive run's family opened
// ([TaskGraph.keepRunRows], named for its first user and now the one row-space
// for every row that is not a node): the graph's id sequence, so no job's row
// can collide with a task's or a run's; the replay in
// [Agent.replayTaskRoster], so a surface that attaches while the job is still
// going is handed the row rather than an empty column; and the checkpoint, so a
// conversation reopened tomorrow redraws what it ran rather than an empty column
// beside a transcript full of jobs.
//
// A JOB IS A FAMILY OF ONE. A run hands over a whole family per publish because
// its rows move together; a job has no workers, no parts and no children, so the
// slice it hands over is the one row it is.
//
// WHAT IS NOT REUSED IS A NODE'S AFTERLIFE. No project index row, no landing
// note, no card in the conversation, no room. A job already tells the model it
// ended, once, on the steering lane ([jobRegistry.settleExit]), and a second
// account of the same ending in a different vocabulary would be the harness
// narrating itself. The row is a row.
//
// A TASK NODE IS NOT GIVEN ONE. Task nodes are in the job registry too — one id
// space, one log, one kill (jobs.go's [jobKindTask]) — and they already have the
// roster row this file is about, published by the graph. A second row would be
// the same work counted twice, on the column and in the head count both.
//
// EXECUTION DOES NOT SURVIVE THE PROCESS AND THE ROW SAYS SO. Jobs are children
// of this process and die with it, so a row that came back saying "running"
// would claim a present that ended — and the seam settles exactly such a row on
// the way in, in the run rows' own words with the one noun changed: a job's log
// is kept where a run's journal is (task_store.go's [jobEndedReport]). Nothing
// is restarted, nothing re-enters a frontier, and a restored row counts as
// nobody working.

// invented a second name for the same work would leave a person unable to match

	// NOTHING SERIALIZES THE TWO ANNOUNCEMENTS BECAUSE PROGRAM ORDER ALREADY
	// DOES. Every start registers the job and announces it BEFORE it launches the
	// goroutine that can settle it (see [jobRegistry.start] and
	// [jobRegistry.adopt]), so a "done" can never overtake the "running" that has
	// to precede it, and two different jobs are two different families with

	// section and once among the task families.
	//
	// WHAT THE STORE KEEPS IS STILL A TASK ROW because the store is a FILE, and
