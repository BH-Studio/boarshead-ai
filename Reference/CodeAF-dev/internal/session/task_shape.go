// THE BRIEF A PERSON'S OWN TASK IS ACTUALLY GIVEN.
//
// `/task write a blog post about our launch` used to be handed to an autonomous
// worker exactly as typed, under the one canned done-condition
// [taskPersonAcceptance] — no constraints, no quality bar, no definition of
// done. A sentence is a fine thing to say to somebody who can ask you a
// question; a node cannot ask anybody anything (task_contract.go), so a
// one-sentence brief is a worker guessing at every decision the sentence did
// not make, and the two things that come back are work that is stuck and work
// that is technically responsive and useless.
//
// So one auxiliary call reads what the person typed and writes the brief and the
// acceptance the worker is held to.
//
// ── IT IS A META-PROMPT, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN ──
//
// prompts/shape.md contains no domain rules. It does not say what a blog post
// needs, what a migration needs, what a research task needs, because the next
// request is always some kind of work nobody enumerated. What it teaches is HOW
// TO REASON: name the domain, name who receives the output and what good means
// to them, name how this particular kind of work goes wrong, decide what a
// worker with nobody to ask needs settled, and say what done looks like to a
// second party. A rule list would have been a rule list that is wrong for
// whatever somebody types tomorrow.
//
// ── BESIDE THE WORKER, NEVER IN FRONT OF IT ──
//
// WHAT WAS TRUE: the call stood between the command and the graph. `/task`
// awaited it for up to [taskShapeWindow] before the node existed, behind the
// sizing judge's own wait, and on 2026-09-11 both ran their windows out on a
// thinking model and returned nothing — twenty-eight seconds of `shaping the
// brief…` on every `/task`, after which the worker got the person's sentence
// anyway (issue #936).
//
// WHAT IS TRUE NOW: the node is admitted at once on the person's own sentence
// and the canned done-condition, and the shaper is asked BESIDE THE NODE'S FIRST
// WORKER, through the same reading every other answer beside the work comes
// through (task_beside.go). The same model is asked the same question about the
// same words; only when it is asked has moved. When the answer lands
// ([Agent.deliverShaped]) the node's contract is written and the worker is
// handed it on its queue, in the same document it opened on — never a second
// brief format. A shaper that cannot answer changes nothing: the worker is
// already doing what the person typed, which is exactly what a cut shaper always
// meant.
//
// WHAT THIS COSTS, SAID PLAINLY. The worker's first steps are taken on the
// person's sentence rather than on the brief, which is what every `/task` whose
// shaper ran out its window was already doing; the brief reaches it a few steps
// in, and it is the brief the checker judges by from then on. And the shaper no
// longer names the work or places it: the node is named the moment it exists by
// the namer every unnamed door uses (taskname.go), and where it stands is
// decided at admission by the one ladder every door climbs (taskstands.go),
// which reads the paths in the person's own sentence — a folder cannot be moved
// under a worker that is already working in it.
//
// ── THEIR WORDS SURVIVE WHATEVER THE SHAPER DOES ──
//
// The shaped text goes in the spec's brief; the spec's REQUEST is still the raw
// sentence, and [composeBrief] prints it above the work under the heading that
// says whose words they are, with the rule that where the two read differently
// theirs are what was asked for. So a shaper that overreached is overruled by
// the document itself, and not by anybody having to notice. The prompt asks for
// the quote inside the brief as well, because the constraints it writes are
// attached to that quote and read as commentary on it — the doubling is
// deliberate and it is the cheap half of the guarantee, not the load-bearing
// one.
