// The state card is what this conversation is FOR and where it stands, kept
// outside the transcript and rebuilt in front of the model on every turn.
//
// It exists because compaction stopped being a model call. The old pass paid a
// summarizer, at the worst possible moment, to answer a question nobody had
// asked until the window filled: what was this conversation about? The card
// answers it CONTINUOUSLY instead — the post-turn extractor already reads every
// exchange (memory.go), and it was already returning a state delta that nothing
// read ([reflex.ExtractResult.State]). Folding that delta into a small file
// amortizes the whole cost across the turns that produced it, and leaves
// compaction to rearrange in all but the last resort, when a pass that cannot
// shrink the conversation any other way writes a summary (compact_summary.go).
//
// ── WHY THIS IS NOT state.json ──
//
// state.go's working state is the MODEL'S OWN notebook: it writes to it with
// `track` and `commit`, it names records by id, and nothing writes there that
// the model did not decide to write. This card is written by nobody's hand — it
// is what a cheap reader noticed about an exchange after the fact. Two files,
// two authors, and a corruption in either costs only its own author's record.
//
// ── THE CAPS ARE THE WHOLE DESIGN ──
//
// A card that grew would be the memory.md failure again: paid for on every
// request, forever, whether or not the turn had anything to do with it. So every
// list is bounded ([cardMaxDone], [cardMaxRefs], [cardMaxItems]) and the OLDEST
// entries go first — what landed an hour ago is history, and the card is a
// statement about now.
