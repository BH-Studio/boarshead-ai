// CARRY OR REFUSE, PROVED (issue #272).
//
// The counterfactual every test here starts from is the measured one: a person's
// live checkout holds uncommitted work, a task is carved from it — so the seal
// puts the same hunks on the task's branch — and then the task lands. Before
// this file the landing failed with one sentence that named no files at all and
// ended in a bare colon, and the node settled needing a look over a conflict
// nobody could see.
