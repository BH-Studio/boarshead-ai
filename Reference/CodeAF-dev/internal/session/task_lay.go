// task_lay.go is how a ledger arrives over a folder: ALL OF IT, OR NONE OF IT,
// and every file whole.
//
// The lay used to walk the ledger and copy each path where it went, returning at
// the first one it could not place — so a folder family whose second file had
// nowhere to go left the person holding the first half of a deliverable, under a
// row that said done (#256). Two rules fix it and they are the ordinary ones for
// writing over somebody's own files:
//
//   - NOTHING IS IN PLACE UNTIL EVERYTHING CAN BE. The whole ledger is copied
//     beside its targets first; only when every one of them is staged does
//     anything move. A refusal takes its own leavings away and the folder is as
//     it was found.
//   - EACH FILE ARRIVES WHOLE. What is staged is renamed into place rather than
//     written over the top, so a lay stopped by a kill or a full disk leaves the
//     person's own file or the finished new one — never a truncated half of
//     either.
//
// It serves the audit's restores too ([layWork] is the one door), where the tree
// being written into is a throwaway copy and the guarantee costs a rename.

// laidWork is one ledger staged beside its targets and not yet in place.
