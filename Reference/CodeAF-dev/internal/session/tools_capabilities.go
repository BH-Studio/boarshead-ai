// THE SHELF: TOOLS THIS BUILD HAS AND THE MODEL IS NOT CARRYING.
//
// Every schema on the belt rides ahead of the whole transcript on every request
// this session makes (prefixbudget_test.go weighs it), so a verb reached for
// twice a week costs exactly what `read` costs. The rarely-reached families are
// therefore built exactly as they always were, by tools.go, out of the same
// gates — and then held back, with one small verb, `load_capability`, put where
// they were.
//
// Three contracts, and they are the whole of this file:
//
//   - A LOADED GROUP IS ARMED THROUGH [Agent.armFamily], the same door a
//     connected account's tools arrive through, bound by the same append law:
//     tools go at the tail, nothing already there moves, nothing retires. The
//     tools are the SAME [bare.Tool] values tools.go built, so approval, hooks,
//     events and billing are unchanged. Loading is not permission.
//   - THE TABLE IS NAMES. It never carries a schema or a gate, and is matched
//     against the belt that was actually built — so a tool this machine cannot
//     offer is missing from the shelf for free, and a group with no surviving
//     member does not exist. Nothing here can promise a capability the build
//     does not have.
//   - NOTHING IS SHELVED WHERE [Config.shelvesCapabilities] is false, which is
//     inside a task: a node is briefed once and lands, the saving is only paid
//     on a prefix re-sent every turn, and the landing belt (withdrawn.go) needs
//     the making verbs directly.
