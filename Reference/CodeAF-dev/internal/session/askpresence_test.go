// A SESSION STOPPED ON THE MODEL'S OWN `ask` SAYS SO WHERE EVERY OTHER WINDOW
// READS IT.
//
// The presence file is the one place home, another window and the `--host` link
// look to find out what a conversation is doing, and the whole question goes on
// it — not the head alone — because a row that offers no answers is a row a
// person can read and not act on. The consent lane is covered beside the gate
// (question_test.go); this is the lane a model raises, which is the one that
// crosses the wire on the road a plain `codeaf` takes.
