// artifacts.go is the global deliverables index (docs/CHAT-V3.md, Decision
// 26): one append-only JSONL file under the v3 home, one row per thing the
// harness produced FOR the person — a generated image, an export, a finished
// document. It is a citation, not an archive, in exactly the sense
// task_index.go established: the smallest row that lets a person find the work
// again, from any directory, by title and recency.
//
// It is GLOBAL where tasks.jsonl is per-project, because the question it
// answers — "where is that report from Tuesday" — is a cross-project question.
// Droppings (logs, stubs) are never recorded here; a row in this file
// is a claim that a person might want the path back.
