// THE STORE RECORDS LIVENESS AT THE CADENCE OF THE WORK.
//
// tasks.json is written at admission and at landing, so between them a working
// node and a hung one are the same two bytes on disk. These tests read the pulse
// FROM INSIDE THE RUN — a scripted step is a provider call, so a step that opens
// the sidecar is reading what the node is saying about itself at that exact
// instant — which is the only place the claim "at the cadence of the work" can
// actually be checked.
