// ── THE FAILURES THAT WERE READ AS THE WRONG THING ──────────────────────────
//
// Every test here is one of the three misreadings the response boundary was
// written for, driven through the real machinery: the wire read as the model,
// the wire read as the end of a turn, and the wire read as something to wait
// forever for. The evidence is a five-run comparison in which the three runs
// that happened to roll four bad responses in a row spent $9.50–15.80 each, with
// 57–82% of it on a model bought to answer for somebody else's bad minute, while
// the run that never rolled four cost $2.33 in total.

// malformedUpstream is the refusal the measured runs actually drew: a 400 the
// ROUTER glossed as "Provider returned error", with the upstream named and the
// upstream's own body saying what it really was — a tool call whose arguments
// did not survive the stream. Four of them arrived in a row from four different
// endpoints serving the same model.
