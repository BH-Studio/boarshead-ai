// THE RUN ROAD'S OWN HALF OF THE SEAT LAW. [NewBeltWorker] builds the worker
// the run engine hosts each claimed store task in (internal/run's BashWorker),
// and unlike the /task road's spawn — which reads the belt switch and sets the
// seat beside it (task_run.go's workerSeat) — it had no posture of its own: a
// run worker's every call went out with no reasoning field at all.
//
// The seat it now takes is [effort.RoleWork], the same one the /task road
// chooses with its belt on. What these tests pin is the RESOLUTION and not a
// field: the constructor sets the role, and [effort.Resolve]'s own order —
// turn beats conversation beats task beats role beats the install's default —
// decides the rung, so nothing here special-cases a scope.
