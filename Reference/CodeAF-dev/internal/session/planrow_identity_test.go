// planrow_identity_test.go pins the IDENTITY THE RUN'S DOOR PUBLISHES: the row a
// person is answered with says which task of the plan store it is, and that id
// is the one the store's own read answers under.
//
// THE SURFACE CANNOT WORK THIS OUT FOR ITSELF. The row and the store task wear
// the same title, and a title cannot tell a run's row — which the graph holds no
// node for — from a node that merely says the same words; the tasks place drew
// the wrong half of the pair and its Enter opened an empty room (#1355). So the
// door that mints both halves in one breath states the link
// ([TaskNotice.PlanTask]), and this test is the two ends of it meeting.
