// STOP IS STOP.
//
// These tests pin the law issue #265 was filed for: a person's stop must be able
// to end a turn even when the turn is parked on a wait that cannot be cancelled.
// They are deliberately NOT written against a flock — #264 removed that one
// concrete instance, and a test that only proved the flock was gone would prove
// nothing about the general guarantee. The wait here is a channel nobody ever
// closes, spliced onto the belt as a tool: an honest uncancellable wait, of a
// shape nothing in this package has any special knowledge of.
