// WHICH MODEL A PIECE OF WORK RUNS ON, AND WHETHER THE ROW SAYS SO.
//
// Three holes, all of them on the publishing side rather than in the choosing:
// a person's task picked its model minutes after it was admitted, a run's nodes
// resolved the worker tier and then published nothing about it, and a node whose
// model was swapped for an incapable one kept naming the model it had refused.
// The law all three now keep: A ROW NAMES THE MODEL ITS WORK IS ACTUALLY ON, and
// the id is settled once — at admission for a task, at the run's start for its
// nodes — so nothing about it moves under a later /model.
//
// What none of this claims is anything deeper than the first node. A task may
// spawn work of its own and that work settles its own model when IT is admitted.

// A PERSON'S TASK FREEZES ITS MODEL AT ADMISSION. It used to admit an empty
// model field and let the worker fall to whatever the conversation was on when
// it eventually started, which is the same task on a different model depending
// on how long the queue was.
