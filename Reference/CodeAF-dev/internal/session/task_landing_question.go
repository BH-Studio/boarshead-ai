// A LANDED `your call` IS A QUESTION, AND IT IS PUT TO THE PERSON THE MOMENT IT
// LANDS.
//
// ── THE RUN THIS WAS WRITTEN FROM ──
//
// A divided task landed needing somebody's look, the model spent `accept` on it
// under `task.settle = auto`, and the merge was refused by the person's own
// uncommitted copies of the files the task wrote. The node RE-SETTLED as the
// person's call — a different question, with different answers, now theirs — and
// no surface in the product drew a single answer for it: the card in the
// conversation was frozen in the shape of the first landing, the node's own room
// read `this task has finished — say it to main`, and the rail said `your call`
// with nothing to press. A bright terminal state with no handle (#767).
//
// ── WHY NOTHING DREW IT ──
//
// [Agent.landingQuestion] has built the object all along, and [Agent.OpenQuestions]
// derives it from [Agent.PendingDecisions] — but the ONLY thing that ever put a
// landing question in front of a surface was [Agent.WatchQuestions] replaying
// what was open AT THE MOMENT A WINDOW ATTACHED. A question raised after that,
// or re-shaped after that, reached nobody: no lane emitted [EventQuestion] for
// it, so a window that had been watching all along never heard.
//
// ── THE LAW ──
//
// EVERY MOVE OF A NODE IS A MOVE OF ITS QUESTION. A node that reaches
// [TaskUnverified] raises one; a node that moves while it is there — the decider
// changing hands, a refused accept re-shaping the ask from `nobody could check
// it` into `your folder already has files the task wrote` — RAISES IT AGAIN with
// the new shape, and the surface refreshes the question it is already drawing
// rather than stacking a second (internal/tui3's [app.raiseQuestion] matches on
// the token); a node that settles takes it back.
//
// TWO MOVES ARE NOT NEW QUESTIONS. A move that is the ANSWER'S OWN WORK IN
// FLIGHT — the accept whose merge is still deciding, the re-audit still
// spending its window — raises nothing and withdraws nothing: the notice
// carries [TaskNotice.Settling], and asking again within seconds with no new
// fact is how one card got answered twelve times in an hour (#1077). And a
// question somebody ANSWERED carries that answer's fate when it is raised
// again — what was answered, when, and what became of it — so the re-asked
// card never reads as though the last answer was ignored (question.go's
// [Agent.landingQuestion] consults the decision record, the raise owing the
// record what the replay already owed it).
//
// IT RIDES [Agent.emitTaskUpdate] BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONE DOOR EVERY MOVE GOES
// THROUGH. A second list of which landings have been asked about would be a
// second source of truth for a fact the graph already holds, which is the defect
// pending.go exists against; what is kept here is only WHICH SHAPE was last put
// out, so that a question can be taken back in the kind it was raised in.

// emitted no [EventQuestionAnswered] — fine for the window that closes itself

	// is not blanketed by this: resettle hands the claim back inside its
	// locked write, before the notice is built (task_run.go's
	// [TaskGraph.resettle]).
	//
	// A DECIDER CHANGE IS STILL A NEW FACT, and it survives the flight. `let
	// codeaf decide this one` or `take it back` pressed while a re-audit runs
	// changes who holds the decision — the ask's own shape — and a card drawing
	// `codeaf is deciding` for the five minutes of the flight, after the person
	// took it back, contradicts the person's own act. So a flight holds down
	// only the moves that are the loop (#1077's re-raises with no new fact) —
	// spend, heartbeat, done-phase — and lets a changed holder through to the
