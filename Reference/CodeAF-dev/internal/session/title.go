package session

// The session's name.
//
// A conversation needs one word-sized handle — for the picker that lists
// sessions, for a window title, for a person deciding which of yesterday's
// three sessions to resume. Nobody wants to type it, and the first exchange
// already says what the session is about, so the session names itself once and
// then never again.
//
// Three properties are the whole design:
//
//   - ONE NAMING, ONCE, AND IT STARTS ON THE FIRST MESSAGE. It fires the moment
//     the person's first message is ACCEPTED by a session that has no name yet —
//     beside the answer, not behind it — and a session resumed from a journal
//     already has its name, the title line being read back at open. A namer that
//     ran every turn would be a tax on every turn, and a name that changed under
//     the person would make the picker unreadable.
//
//     IT USED TO RUN AT THE END OF THE TURN, and that is the change: a name is
//     what the conversation is called in the picker, in the rail and in the tab
//     the person is looking at WHILE the answer is being written, so a name that
//     arrives after a ten-minute answer arrives after the only minutes it was
//     needed for. The first message is enough to name a session — it is what the
//     person came to ask — and the answer, when there is one by then, is added
//     to the prompt as it always was.
//     A SHELL OPENING WAITS FOR AN ANSWER. Its first ordinary question can be
//     only "what did that print?", which says nothing without the reply. Human
//     shell turns keep their command preview until an ordinary exchange has
//     an answer; naming then starts through the end-of-turn door.
//
//   - AND IT IS NEVER SERIAL WITH THE ANSWER. The errand runs on its own
//     goroutine, on the SESSION'S lifetime and not the turn's ([Agent.titleCtx]),
//     and nothing in the turn ever waits on it. Both halves of that matter: a
//     turn's context would cancel a name the moment a quick answer finished, and
//     a turn that waited would be the very thing this change is about.
//
//   - THE CHEAP MODEL. The model is resolved through internal/roles as
//     RoleTitle, which puts it on the low tier by default: a wrong title costs a
//     glance and is rewritten by the next session, so it is the archetypal cheap
//     call. A person who has configured nothing gets the session's own model,
//     which is roles.Resolve's floor and not a failure.
//
//   - ONLY A JOURNALED SESSION NAMES ITSELF. A session with no file has
//     nowhere to keep a name and nothing to be listed in — the name exists for
//     the picker, which lists files — so an in-memory conversation (a headless
//     one-shot, a test) pays for nothing. That is also why the gate reads "the
//     session file has no title yet": a resume already has its name.
//
//   - A NAME THAT IS NOT A NAME IS REFUSED, and the session stays unnamed. The
//     models this lands on are the cheapest ones configured, and a small model
//     answering with the instruction it was given is an ordinary failure — one
//     that named a real session on this machine "name this session in ≤8 words,
//     lowercase, no quotes". [cleanTitle] throws that answer away, [healedTitle]
//     throws away the ones already written down, and the person's opening words
//     stand in meanwhile. A session left unnamed asks again the next time it is
//     opened, on its next message: titleTried is a fact about this process, and
//     the title read back off the file is now empty.
//
//   - NAMING IS BOUNDED, INCLUDING UNUSABLE ANSWERS. Empty replies and invalid
//     labels fall through the same model ladder as request failures. Up to
//     every ask shares one titleWindow; another turn never adds an errand.
//
//   - IT NEVER BREAKS THE TURN, AND NOW IT NEVER DELAYS ONE EITHER. A failed,
//     empty or cancelled title leaves the session unnamed and says nothing.
//     There is no event kind for "a small thing did not work", and inventing one
//     — or borrowing EventError, which means the turn ended badly — would report
//     a fault about work the person never asked for. Its spend is billed the
//     moment it lands, against the model that answered, on the session's ledger
//     and never inside the turn's own sealed figure ([Agent.addAuxiliaryUsageAs]
//     — the ledger has always taken these outside the turn total).
//
//   - AND THE NAME REACHES A SURFACE WHETHER OR NOT THE TURN IS STILL GOING.
//     The turn's hub carries it when one is running, which is where every
//     surface already reads it from; the standing lane ([Agent.WatchTitle])
//     carries it when the answer finished first, which is now the ordinary case
//     for a short question. A surface reading both draws the same name twice,
//     which is one idempotent assignment.

// three words of it and a task stood on the rail called `I'll start by`, while
// the node's own record still carried the person's words right beside the name
// it had been given.
//
// THE CUT IS WHAT MADE A SENTENCE LOOK LIKE A LABEL. Nothing refused an answer
// for being a sentence; it was shortened until it was the right length to pass
// for a name. So an answer is refused BY ITS SHAPE AND AT ANY LENGTH: a name is
// a noun phrase, and a clause about the speaker is not one. A noun phrase that
