// The person's own door onto a run's plan: the hard verbs a surface offers
// beside the soft note, and the one place this package writes the store the
// worker's own CLI also writes. Every write goes through a store method — the
// graph laws, the cascade to descendants and dependents, and the ownership
// checks are the store's and are not repeated here — and the only thing this
// layer owns is the boundary: an id is resolved inside THIS conversation's
// plan, so a task another chat spawned is never reachable, and the store's own
// sentence is what a store refusal answers with.
//
// LOCK ORDER: every verb opens the store under the plan gate the way the
// reading verbs and every pulse do (openPlanHandle), so a steering write can
// never interleave with a pulse mid-pass; the store's own mutex and its one
// transaction serialize the writers on either side of the process.
