// The two hands the session has outside this machine: find a page, read a page.
//
// They are one file and two tools because that is how the work actually goes —
// a model searches, reads the list, picks a link, fetches it — and a single
// merged tool would either fetch every hit (slow, and mostly pages nobody
// wanted) or make the model say which hit to fetch before it has seen the list.
//
// Neither tool knows a vendor. Both call an interface [Config] was handed;
// internal/search's live wrapper resolves that interface from the person's
// current settings on each operation. Adding a back end changes nothing here,
// and a test drives a scripted one without a network.

// Result-count bounds for one web_search call. The default is what a model
// asking for nothing gets; the cap is [search.RenderResults]'s own render
// bound, restated here so the number the model is PROMISED in the schema is the
// number it can actually receive. A schema advertising twenty results that the
// renderer then cuts to eight is a schema that lies.

// number rather than to a second literal that can drift from this one.

// an absent ask is the default; a zero, a negative or an over-ask is corrected
// silently rather than refused.

// searchTools is the web half of the belt, and it is CONDITIONAL: a nil half
// contributes no tool.
//
// The condition is the point. A belt is a promise — every tool on it is a thing
// the model has been told it can do — and a web_search that answers "no search
// back end is configured" breaks that promise in the most expensive way
// available: the model pays for the call, reads a refusal that sounds
// temporary, and keeps the capability in its plan for the rest of the turn. A
// model that was never told about web_search simply says it cannot look things
// up, which is both true and free.
//
// In a built binary neither half is ever nil — internal/search's zero-key plugs
// self-register — so this is the shape a stripped build, a test, or a caller
// that never wired the pair sees.
