// THINKING — hidden deltas, nothing on the screen — and is then ended by
// machinery rather than by the person. There was no partial reply to keep, so
// the whole ending was a transcript with a question in it and nothing after,
// a model-call row saying `context canceled`, and an idle status line.

// thinkingStep streams reasoning nobody can read and then waits to be stopped.
// It is the measured shape: 6,174 reasoning tokens and not one visible word.
