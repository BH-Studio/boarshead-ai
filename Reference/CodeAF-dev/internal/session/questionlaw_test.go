// THE LAW: EVERY QUESTION THIS ENGINE ASKS IS RAISED THROUGH ONE DOOR.
//
// A question has three moments — raised, answered, withdrawn — and a surface
// that heard the first and can never hear the other two draws a question that
// stays on screen after it is settled, in every window but the one that
// answered it. That is exactly what five lanes did: connect, the harness offer,
// the harness design, a sub-harness intake card, a running sub-harness's own
// question and an adaptive run at its fuel gate each sent their own turn event
// and nothing else, so the question existed on the questions lane only as
// something [Agent.OpenQuestions] derived when somebody happened to subscribe.
//
// The fix is one door ([Agent.raiseQuestion]) that banks the words, lets the
// lane say its own row, and emits the raise — and this test is what keeps it
// one. It walks this package's own source, because a rule that is only written
// in a doc comment is a rule the next lane will not read.
//
// WHAT IT ASKS, and what each answer is worth:
//
//   - [EventQuestion] is emitted in exactly one function. A lane that emits it
//     itself has skipped the banking, which is what makes the answer and the
//     withdrawal speak at all.
//   - [Agent.rememberQuestion] is called in exactly one function, for the same
//     reason from the other side: words banked without a raise are a question
//     nobody was ever told about that still refuses the next one.

// ([Agent.putBackQuestion]).

// questionRestate is the other road that is not a raise: a question ALREADY
// standing, said again because a fact ON it changed — its clock stopped under
// somebody's hand ([Agent.restateQuestion], asklane.go). It may not go through
// the door: raising it again would put `no longer needed` on the screen of the
// person reading it and hand it a fresh settle guard and a fresh reading clock
// mid-decision. It banks the same question under the same token and says it
// once more, which every surface upserts.
//
// THE PROTECTION IS THE CALLER'S GUARD AND NOT THIS FUNCTION. What makes it a
// re-statement rather than a second raise door is that its one caller takes the
// entry out of the book first ([Agent.holdAsk]: `open := a.asked.atLocked(id)`,
// and nothing happens when that is nil), so only a question already raised can
// reach it. A lane that called it without that check would be using the
// exception as a shortcut onto the screen, which is the hole this law exists to
// close — arriving through the allowance instead of around it.
