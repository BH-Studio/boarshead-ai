package session

// PRESENCE: WHICH SESSIONS ARE ALIVE RIGHT NOW, AND WHICH OF THEM NEEDS ITS
// PERSON.
//
// task_index.go keeps what this project's work CAME TO — an append-only record,
// written once per landed node, read by anything asking about the past. It is
// the right shape for history and the wrong shape for the present: a row that
// said "running" when it was appended goes on saying so forever, and the moment
// the window that wrote it crashes or is closed, the claim is a lie nobody is
// left to correct. Opening that session again closes its rows
// ([Agent.closeInflightTaskIndexRows]) — but "again" may be next week, and the
// question this file answers is asked NOW, from a DIFFERENT window.
//
// So each live session keeps one small file saying what it is doing at this
// instant, and every other window may read it without opening a journal, taking
// a lock, or knowing anything about the session that wrote it.
//
// ── THE FOUR LAWS ──
//
//   - IT IS A CLAIM ABOUT A LIVE PROCESS, NEVER A RECORD. Nothing here is
//     history and nothing here is ever appended to. The file is rewritten whole
//     on every refresh and describes only this instant; the past is
//     task_index.go's, and a reader that wants to know what happened must go
//     there.
//
//   - IT IS ONLY TRUE WHILE IT IS FRESH. A process that is killed, panics or
//     loses its machine writes no farewell, so a file left behind would claim a
//     session that is gone. THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES A PRESENCE FILE TRUE IS
//     ITS AGE: [presenceHeartbeat] refreshes it while the session lives, and a
//     reader takes it as live only inside [presenceWindow], which is three
//     heartbeats. Past that the session is gone and every "running" it claims is
//     void. That is why there is no cleanup daemon and no pid liveness check —
//     staleness IS the cleanup, and it costs nothing and cannot go wrong.
//
//   - A WRITE THAT FAILS IS DROPPED IN SILENCE. This is a courtesy to other
//     windows, and a session must not break, stall or say anything because a
//     read-only disk would not take a two-hundred-byte file. It is the same
//     bargain [appendTaskIndex] makes, for the same reason.
//
//   - IT SAYS WHAT A PERSON WOULD SAY. The state words are "working",
//     "waiting on you" and "idle", and the reason beside them is one plain
//     line. Nothing in this file is machinery vocabulary, because everything in
//     it is written to be read on a surface.
//
// ── THE FORMAT, AND WHY ──
//
// ONE JSON OBJECT, written whole, in the session's own folder as presence.json:
//
//	~/.codeaf/v3/projects/<encoded-workspace>/<session-id>/presence.json
//
// JSON and not JSONL because there is exactly one fact here and it is replaced
// rather than accumulated — the append-only shape task_index.go argues for is
// what you want when two processes share one file, and no two processes ever
// share this one. It sits in the SESSION folder rather than the project bucket
// for the same reason: one writer, one file, so a bucket read is a readdir and
// never a merge, and deleting a session folder takes its presence with it.
//
// The write is TEMP-AND-RENAME in the same directory, exactly as [SaveMeta] is:
// a reader must see the whole of one refresh or the whole of the one before it,
// never half of either. A rename inside a directory is atomic, which is the only
// crash-safety this file needs — there is nothing here worth recovering, so a
// crash mid-write costs one refresh and the next heartbeat repairs it.
//
// The object carries a SCHEMA NUMBER and a reader refuses any number it does not
// know. That is deliberately the conservative reading: a session running a newer
// build is a session this build cannot describe honestly, and the honest answer
// about a session you cannot describe is to say nothing about it at all.
//
// ── AND THE QUESTION TRAVELS TOO ──
//
// A session stopped on a card says WHAT IT IS ASKING and which answers it will
// take ([PresenceQuestion]), so another window can answer it without opening
// this one. The answer comes back on a file of its own beside this one
// (answers.go); nothing is ever written INTO a presence file by a reader, which
// is what keeps "one writer, one file" true and keeps this a claim rather than a
// mailbox.
