package session

// A CONVERSATION IN A TEAM: who it is there, what it is told, and what it is
// shown.
//
// internal/teams is the one store for teams (teams.json) and for the Traffic a
// team's members and manager write to each other (teams/<id>/traffic.jsonl).
// The conversations view writes it from the interface; this file is the other
// reader and writer, the session's half, and the two meet ONLY through that
// store. Nothing here calls into the interface and nothing there calls in here
// for a team feature, which is what lets either side restart, run on another
// build, or not be running at all without the other losing a message.
//
// THREE THINGS LIVE HERE, and each has one door:
//
//   - IDENTITY ([Agent.teamRoles]). A conversation finds its teams by its own
//     conversation key, which is the key the interface stores a member under:
//     the transcript's path, cleaned and with its symlinks resolved (tui3's
//     convKey, detach.go). Both spellings are kept, cleaned and resolved, because
//     a hosted surface keys an engine's path by its cleaned spelling alone and
//     /tmp against /private/tmp is one file with two names on a Mac. The manager
//     is the member whose key is Team.Manager.
//   - DELIVERY ([Agent.teamBoundary]). At every step boundary, the one legal place a
//     user-role line may join a turn (agent.go's [Agent.drainSteering]), what was
//     addressed to this conversation since its cursor is put in front of the
//     model as ONE marked note: "◆ from manager: …", "from @web: …". It is the
//     session's line and never the person's, and it is journaled as a note so
//     a reopened page draws it in the harness's lane. The boundary itself
//     starts no turn; the lines that ask for an answer (a directive to a
//     member, a reply to the manager) wake an idle conversation through the
//     traffic watch (team_wakewatch.go), which hands them over by this door.
//   - THE ROLE ([teamRoleBlock]). What this conversation IS in each team, the
//     manager of it with its members named and its three laws, or a member
//     under a manager with its handle and its verb, rides a note of its own
//     ([teamRoleNoteOpening]) worded as codeaf's instruction. It is composed
//     from the same read the boundary makes before the request, so it is in
//     front of the model from the first request a conversation sends as a
//     manager, and never waits on a read beside the work.
//   - THE DIGEST ([Agent.refreshTeamDigest]). A manager's turn carries
//     [teams.Digest] for its team in a note of its own at the tail of the
//     transcript ([teamNoteOpening]). It is read beside the work at the start
//     of a turn, the way the other windows' block is (taskdelta.go), and never
//     carries a member's transcript.
//
// WHO IS NEVER IN A TEAM. A task node, a worker and an auditor are not
// conversations anybody put in a team: their keys are not in the file, and a
// node's brief is its whole world by contract. They are answered no before any
// disk is read ([Config.teamProfile]).
//
// AN EMPTY PROFILE DIRECTORY IS NOT ONE OF THEM. It is the ordinary launch:
// CODEAF_PROFILE_DIR is what nearly nobody exports, so the engine daemon that
// builds a conversation hands it "" and means the profile where it always is
// ([config.ProfilePath] is the one place that says so). This file once read
// "" as "no team", and that made every team feature, the verbs, the brief,
// delivery, events and the wake, dead for everybody while every test here
// passed, because every test set the directory. A test keeps off the person's
// real teams the way this package's tests keep off every other file under the
// state root: hermetic_test.go moves HOME for the run, and internal/home
// refuses a test binary the root it inherited.

// IT IS AN INSTRUCTION AND SAYS SO. The digest's opening calls its note facts
// and not requests, which is right for a list of who is doing what and wrong
// for "you are this team's manager": a model told that its role is a fact
// beside the work, and not a request, weighs it like one, and the manager found
// on the ordinary launch answered "what is happening here" as an ordinary chat
// about its folder. So the role rides its own opening, in codeaf's voice.

	"2. The person outranks you: what they say in a member's own conversation stands over your directive, and a conflict goes to them.\n" +
	"3. You cannot answer a member's permission prompt; tell the person it is waiting.\n" +
	"4. You direct only the members who report to you, one level down: a team under yours is its manager's to run, so you direct that manager, never its members. A member team_status marks `reports to` another team is shared: read it and send it notes, never a directive or a stop.\n" +
	"5. Members' questions come to you as decision packets: answer with team_decide, or send one up with team_escalate when it is not yours to decide. Your own questions go up the same way.\n" +
	"6. A team's daily cap is the person's: you cannot raise it, and at the cap nothing new starts until they answer.\n" +
	"7. A conflict between conversations is declared with team_raise and goes to the lowest manager above every party; when it waits on you, your team_decide reaches every party as a directive."
