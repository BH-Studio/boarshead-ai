package session

// The accounts a person already has, reachable from a conversation.
//
// Three mechanisms live here and the belt (tools_connect.go) is the fourth,
// sitting on top of them:
//
//   - THE SEAM. [connectHub] is the narrow slice of internal/connect this
//     package touches: which services exist, which are connected, how to start
//     connecting one, and an authorized client for one that is. Everything below
//     it — where the credentials live, what a refresh is, which endpoint a
//     mailbox search hits — is that package's business and never this one's.
//   - THE ASK. Connecting an account is a thing done on somebody's behalf with
//     their credentials, so it is a QUESTION, and it is asked exactly the way
//     the approval gate asks one (consent.go): the tool call blocks in its own
//     goroutine, an event goes out, and an answer, a clock or the end of the turn
//     releases it. SILENCE IS A NO. A five-minute clock that approved would be a
//     clock that connected somebody's mail because they went to lunch.
//   - THE ARMING. The tools an account brings are not on the belt until the
//     account is connected, and they arrive by APPENDING to the belt rather than
//     by rebuilding it (see [Agent.armFamily]).
//
// ── WHY CONNECTING IS NEVER JOURNALED ──
//
// For consent's reason, and one more. The session file is the record of what was
// DONE in this conversation; a connected account is a fact about the MACHINE
// that outlives every conversation on it, and a resume that replayed the
// question would be asking again about something already answered elsewhere. So
// the events carry the question and the outcome, and the transcript keeps the
// two things that are true afterwards: the tool result the model read, and the
// tools it was holding from the next turn on.
