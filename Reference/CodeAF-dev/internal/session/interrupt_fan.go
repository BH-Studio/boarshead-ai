// ONE ESC, ONE DECISION.
//
// Measured (F13/F17): one Escape mid-think, then a redirect, fired six model
// calls in the same second — two mastermind replans, two identical title
// calls, a 57-message handoff re-read, and a reflex. The handlers that answer
// an interrupt (the leftover race, the next turn's route, the mark reader, the
// brief writer, the namer) each decided independently what had changed.
//
// SO THEY SHARE ONE GENERATION. Interrupt mints it. The person's next words
// are what changed. Each generation may spend one planner pass and one title
// call; a second claim is silence. A redirect does not re-read the whole
// conversation to write a brief — the new words are the brief.

// interruptRoleKind says which of an Esc generation's two allowances a role

// THE SESSION'S OWN NAMER IS NOT ON THIS LIST, and that is the one exception
// here worth stating. Everything gated above is FOREGROUND WORK bought by the
// turn the person just stopped — a planner, a mark reader, the two words a task
// is called — and the allowance exists so that a leftover and a redirect racing
// inside one generation cannot each buy one.
//
// A session naming itself is none of that. Since #653 it is started when the
// person's first message is accepted, it runs on the SESSION'S lifetime rather
// than any turn's, and its dedup is [Agent.titleTried] — which is strictly
// stronger than a generation's allowance: one naming per session for the life
// of the process, against one per Esc. Leaving it here cost the thing the
// allowance was never about — a transient failure whose retry landed inside a
// live generation was answered with [errInterruptQuiet] and read as "the model
// said no", and the session stayed unnamed; and a task named first in the same
// generation took the slot before the namer's first attempt ever reached it.
//
// [roles.RoleTaskName] keeps the allowance. It is a name bought by the work a
// turn started, on that turn's clock, and it is exactly the case F13/F17 were
// written about.
