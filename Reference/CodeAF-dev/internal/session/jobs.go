package session

// Background execution for the session agent.
//
// A session is a conversation, and a conversation cannot wait ten minutes for
// `npm run dev` to exit — the command never exits, that is the point of it. So
// bash grows one optional argument (background:true, tools.go) and the process
// it starts becomes a JOB: started, registered, watched, and reported on when
// it ends. The model gets an id back in the same beat it made the call.
//
// Three choices here are worth the words:
//
//   - RING + BOUNDED DISK, not one or the other. What a job writes goes to a
//     disk spool bounded to its most recent jobSpoolChunks chunks of
//     jobSpoolChunkBytes each — <id>.log for the live chunk, <id>.log.1 for the
//     one before it, anything earlier discarded with a notice — so the recent
//     log is addressable by the read tool — paged, offset, grepped, the same
//     way any other file is — without a job that prints for a week filling the
//     disk. At a chunk boundary the live bytes are copied once to the backup
//     before the same live inode is truncated; its identity never disappears. Only the last 64KB is kept in memory, and only that tail is
//     ever handed back through a tool result. A watcher that has printed 400MB
//     must not be able to put 400MB in front of the model, and a watcher that
//     printed the one line that matters must not lose it because nobody was
//     polling — the disk answers that for as long as the line is recent, and
//     the notice every footer carries is what keeps the promise honest once it
//     is not (issue #1599).
//
//     WHERE that file is, is landing.go's answer and not this file's: a log is
//     a dropping, so once a session has a folder it lands in the folder rather
//     than in the person's repository. The old reason for keeping it under the
//     workspace — that the read tool reached it with a relative path — is
//     superseded and was never the point: the tool takes an absolute path, and
//     the job card prints one.
//
//   - THE OWED LANE, not a tool and not an event. When a bash job ends, its
//     ending joins the session's boundary batch (agent.go), drained at the next
//     step. The ending carries its output tail and names the log; anything recent
//     remains here behind `jobs output` and on disk, and the footer names the
//     truncation when the beginning has been discarded. A completion is news,
//     not an answer to a question, and the alternative — the model polling
//     `jobs` on a hunch — costs a round trip per hunch and still misses the exit
//     it did not think to check for.
//
//   - NO PUSH MID-BATCH. The ending lands at a step boundary and never inside
//     one, for the same reason user steering does: the transcript's tail
//     mid-batch sits between an assistant's tool_calls and their results, and
//     a user message spliced in there is a shape every provider rejects. A job
//     that exits during a tool batch is reported after that batch, which is
//     the first moment the model could act on it anyway.
