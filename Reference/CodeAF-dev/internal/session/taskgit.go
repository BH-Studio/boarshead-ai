// WHAT WORK RUNNING ON ITS OWN MAY DO TO A REPOSITORY, which is a question about
// its AUTHORITY and not about its manners.
//
// ── THE BREACH THIS WAS WRITTEN FROM ──
//
// A task was asked to fix ten issues in a Python repository. One of its parts,
// working in its own worktree, ran:
//
//	git merge --ff-only main
//
// and fast-forwarded itself onto a branch that already held the upstream
// project's own fixes for the very issues it had been asked to fix. It then
// reported the work as done. Everything it claimed was true and none of it was
// its: the deliverable came home carrying somebody else's commits, and a reader
// looking at the branch could not tell which lines the task wrote. A sibling
// worker in the same run merged one of its OWN family's branches by hand, which
// is the landing road's job and nobody else's (task_run.go's comeHome).
//
// Neither of those is a bad answer to the brief. They are a worker reaching for
// authority it does not have, and no wording of a brief will reliably stop that —
// a model that can see a branch with the answer on it will take the branch. So
// this is a mechanism, fitted where the command is about to run.
//
// ── THE RULE, IN ONE SENTENCE ──
//
// A TASK WORKER'S GIT MAY READ ANYTHING AND MOVE NOTHING. A session that holds
// its own acceptance and decides on its own word that the work is done answers
// to the same list. Both may look wherever they like — log, diff, show,
// merge-base, any branch in the repository — because knowing what is around
// them is how they do the work. Both may SAVE: add and commit leave the work in
// the copy that will be judged. What neither may do is reach a REMOTE, or move
// this working copy onto work it did not do itself.
//
// ── WHY REFS AND NOT PATHS ──
//
// A node's worktree is cut from the person's own repository (task_run.go's
// prepareTaskTree), so it SHARES the object store and every branch in it. A guard
// written about directories would have passed `git merge --ff-only main` without
// blinking: the command ran inside the worktree, on the worktree's own HEAD, and
// touched no path outside it. The thing that was breached was never a directory.
// It was the answer to "whose work is this".
//
// ── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE ──
//
// THE PERSON'S CONVERSATION IS UNTOUCHED. A session somebody is sitting in front
// of, in a checkout they opened themselves, may pull, stash, rebase and merge
// exactly as they would at their own terminal — that is their repository and
// their decision, and a harness that policed it would be answering a question
// nobody asked. An unattended session with no ceiling has the same [Person]
// posture. The other posture is read from [Agent.steward], the one existing
// answer to whether the session decides that its own work is done.
//
// AND ONE NARROW EXCEPTION STANDS BESIDE IT. An UNATTENDED run — a `--yolo`
// launch, which the door records as [Config.Unattended] — that is standing on a
// branch it did not cut may not PUSH that branch or move it with a merge or
// rebase, however quiet the door was about the push. Nothing is taken from the
// person's own conversation: the exception fires only for an unattended run
// standing on a branch it did not create, so a session somebody is steering
// keeps its whole terminal. [taskGitGuard.refusedUnattendedBranchMovement]
// argues the register and the three acts it refuses.
//
// AND THE READING HALF IS NOT NARROWED BY ONE COMMAND. Every refusal below is a
// verb that WRITES; a worker that wants to know what is on main still runs
// `git log main`, `git show main:file` and `git diff HEAD main` and gets the whole
// answer. The line the guard draws is between knowing and taking.

// with no pull request and nobody's word but its own.

// The branch a run found its checkout on when it began is NOT one it created,
// whatever it is called. That is what covers `santos/dev` without growing the
// fixed list of protected names ([protectedBranchNames],
// task_branch_protection.go) — a name merely CONTAINING a protected word is not
