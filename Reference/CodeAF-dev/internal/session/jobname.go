// THE THREE OR FOUR WORDS A BACKGROUND JOB IS CALLED.
//
// A job's row is what a person reads to know what is running: the section on
// the right, the job's own page, the sentence a model is handed in `jobs list`.
// Until this file existed, a plain background command put its RAW INVOCATION
// there, cut to three words — so
//
//	bash -lc "pytest -q tests/ --maxfail=1"
//
// drew as `bash -lc "pytest`. That is not a name. It is whatever the command
// happened to open with, and a column of them names every job after its first
// noise.
//
// So a command is NAMED, by one small call, and the design is four properties
// copied from the task namer (taskname.go) because they are the same job:
//
//   - ONE CALL, ONCE, PER JOB, AND ONLY WHERE NOTHING NAMED IT. A watch, a
//     render, a hand and a task node are each given a label the moment they
//     start ([jobNameOf]), and those labels are what `jobs list` already puts
//     in front of the model. A second call to rename any of those would be the
//     harness disagreeing with itself and billing for it. A command that is
//     already short and has no shell metacharacters in it is left alone too
//     ([jobNameNeeded]), which is what stops `npm run dev` from paying for a
//     call that changes nothing.
//
//   - THE CHEAP MODEL. It resolves through internal/roles as RoleJobName, on
//     the low tier, beside the session's own namer and the task namer: naming
//     in a few words is the archetypal cheap call, and it is one of the calls
//     that must NOT think — the resolved level is deliberately not put on the
//     request.
//
//   - IT NEVER BLOCKS THE WORK. THE JOB NEVER WAITS TO BE NAMED. The process
//     is forked, registered and announced before this call is made; it runs on
//     a goroutine of its own with its own deadline, and the surfaces draw the
//     command they draw today until the answer lands. A name that never arrives
//     costs a good name and nothing else — there is no state for "a small thing
//     did not work" and inventing one would report a fault about work nobody
//     asked for.
//
//   - THE NAME IS THE JOB'S NAME FIELD, NOT A SECOND STRING BESIDE THE
//     COMMAND. It is written through [job.setName], which is under the
//     registry's lock because the name arrives LATE, and one update is
//     published so a row that is already on screen learns it. The command is
//     left exactly as it is: the name is what the job is called, the command
//     is what is running.
//
// IT IS CALLED FROM [Agent.announceJobRow], which is the registry's announce
// callback — the one door every start, adopt, watch, render and hand already
// walks through to reach the agent. A new way of starting a job inherits the
// name without knowing this file exists, and the gate makes the labelled
// kinds a no-op.
