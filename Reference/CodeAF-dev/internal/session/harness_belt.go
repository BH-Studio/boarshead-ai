// harness_belt.go is the ONE answer to "which tools may a saved harness reach".
//
// It had two, and they were a drift pair. The designer was told what it could
// whitelist by [Agent.harnessMachinery], the lint checked the whitelist it wrote
// against [Agent.harnessToolNames], and the RUN resolved those same names
// against a third list assembled in cmd/codeaf's chatv3_harness.go — three
// independent calls to bare.AllTools that nothing held together. A verb added to
// one of them and not the others is a harness the designer may write and the
// runner cannot execute, or worse, a verb the runner would happily execute that
// the lint refuses to let anybody name.
//
// So all three read this.
//
// ── WHAT A HARNESS GETS, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE WHOLE BELT ──
//
// The wire tools (internal/exec/bare) — read, bash, edit, write, grep, find, ls
// — plus THE MEDIA FAMILY, and nothing else.
//
// The exclusions are the same ones they always were, and the reason still
// holds: notes, jobs, connected accounts, watches, settings and the task verbs
// are things a CONVERSATION reaches for. A saved procedure that inherited them
// would be a recipe that could rewrite the person's settings or start a task
// tree, months after anybody read it.
//
// THE MEDIA FAMILY IS NOT IN THAT CATEGORY AND WAS TREATED AS THOUGH IT WERE.
// "Image generation is something a conversation reaches for" was written when
// the only thing anybody made with a harness was a diff — and it was already
// false when it was written: the first harness design anybody wrote for a
// marketing image put generate_image and view_image in its steps, and the lint
// refused the whitelist. Producing a picture to a fixed recipe is exactly the
// kind of work a saved procedure is FOR, and there is nothing conversational
// about it: it takes a prompt, writes a file, and names the path.
//
// ── THE CONDITIONAL-PRESENCE LAW TRAVELS ──
//
// Each media verb is here only when this machine has a model for it, by the
// belt's own law (tools_media.go's [Agent.mediaHand]) and through the very same
// constructors the conversation's belt uses. A machine that cannot draw does not
// offer the designer generate_image, does not let the lint accept it on a
// whitelist, and does not resolve it at run time — three "no"s from one place,
// which is the whole point of this file.

// HarnessBeltSeams is everything the media half of the belt needs from the door
// that builds it: what it may generate with, what it may look with, and where
// what it makes lands. It is a struct rather than a handful of arguments because
// the run door (cmd/codeaf's chatv3_harness.go) fills it from a config it
// already holds, and a positional list of two interfaces, two functions, a
// folder and a path is a call nobody can read at the call site.
//
// ALL OF IT IS OPTIONAL, and it stays optional now that two of the seams are
// about WHERE rather than about what: a zero HarnessBeltSeams yields exactly the
// seven wire tools, which is what a harness has always had and what a machine
// with no media models still gets. A zero [HarnessBeltSeams.Place] does not take
// a verb away — it moves what the verbs write. Such a run lands its files on the
// legacy rung, `<workspace>/.codeaf/images` and its siblings (landing.go's
// ladder), and records none of them, which is the honest answer for a door that
// genuinely has no session folder to land in and the WRONG one for every door
// that has.

	// verb off, exactly as it does on the conversation's belt.
	Media      MediaGenerator

	MediaPick func(modality, word string) (string, error)

	// Seer is the completer view_image asks to look. It is separate from Media
	// because looking is a CHAT call to a vision model and not a media-endpoint
	// call, which is the same split the conversation's belt makes
	// (tools_view.go). Nil leaves view_image off however well the resolver
	// answers, because a verb with nothing to send the picture to is a verb that
	// would refuse on every call.

	// FOUND AGAIN — [Config]'s own two fields, with [Config]'s own meaning.

	// They are seams rather than something this file could work out because a
	// harness writes real deliverables and the media verbs decide where through
	// exactly one ladder (landing.go's [ImagesDir] and its siblings): the owned
	// workspace, then the borrowed session's own artifacts/, then the dot
	// directory under the workspace. Without the Place every belt built here fell
	// to that last rung — the one landing.go's essay calls the wrong answer about
	// litter — so a film a saved procedure assembled landed in a hidden folder
	// inside the person's repository, and without the index it appeared in
	// `/files` nowhere at all. A harness is not a lesser writer than a
	// conversation: what it makes is the same kind of file, wanted back the same
	// way, and it lands in the same place.

	// ArtifactsIndex is the deliverables index file (artifacts.go). Empty

	// different destination, a different sentence back. This agent is never run,
	// never journals and never speaks; it exists so the four constructors have
	// the receiver they are written against.
	//
	// Its usage counters go nowhere, which is correct here and stated so nobody

	// rather than a second row for one file. What it cannot carry is the session
