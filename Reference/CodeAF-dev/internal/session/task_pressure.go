// The admission governor: the machine's own answer to "may one more node
// start".
//
// ── WHY THE COUNT WAS NEVER THE RESOURCE ──
//
// The frontier used to hold a fixed two nodes at once, and two was a guess
// standing in for two real ceilings it could not see. A node is a whole agent
// — its own model calls, its own build, its own checkout — and what actually
// runs out when several of them work at once is CORES and MEMORY, not a
// number somebody picked. On a sixteen-core workstation two was leaving the
// machine idle; on a laptop already carrying somebody's compile, two was one
// too many. So the count became a person's own setting (task.parallel,
// default no limit) and the ceilings became these: load average per core, and
// available memory.
//
// The same lesson is written down in internal/exec's governor.go, from the
// incident that produced it — codeaf pinning a laptop's fan — and the
// per-core figure here is the one it settled on. A task node is exactly the
// class that governor calls LOCAL WORK: it spawns real compilers and real
// test runs on this host, so the host's own reading is the right question to
// ask about it.
//
// ── A READING CANNOT SEE WHAT IT HAS JUST LET IN ──
//
// The governor used to answer one yes or no per frontier pass, from one
// reading, and the frontier marked every ready node running against it. That
// was right for one node and wrong for a fan: twenty parts handed out in one
// breath were twenty agents, twenty worktrees and later twenty builds, every
// one of them admitted against a machine read before any of them existed.
// Neither half of the reading could have caught it. Load average is a
// one-minute decayed figure, and a node's memory arrives with its first
// build, minutes after it started — so the reading that finally shows the
// burst is taken long after the burst was admitted.
//
// So THE GOVERNOR KEEPS A RESERVATION FOR THE WORK IT HAS LET IN, and it is
// asked once PER ADMISSION rather than once per pass ([admissionGovernor.admits]).
// Every running node is expected to need one node's FOOTPRINT of memory
// ([admissionGovernor.footprintLocked]). What the running nodes already hold
// is visible in the reading, as the resident memory of this process and
// everything it started, above what they held when this graph ran nothing. The
// part of the running nodes' footprints NOT yet visible is taken off
// MemAvailable before the floor is compared:
//
//	projected = MemAvailable − max(0, running × footprint − visible)
//
// and one more node starts only while `projected` is at or above the floor.
// The next admission in the same pass therefore sees the machine as it will
// be once the work already admitted is carrying its weight, not as it was
// before any of it started. And nothing is counted twice: as a node's memory
// becomes visible, MemAvailable falls by what `visible` rises by, so the
// projection stands still while the reading catches up and moves only when a
// node settles or the machine frees memory of its own.
//
// With nothing of this graph running there is nothing to reserve, and the
// first node is judged on the reading alone, exactly as every node was before
// the reservation existed. That is also why the fan a quiet machine starts at
// once is 1 + (MemAvailable − floor) ÷ footprint and not one fewer: the floor
// is the room the machine keeps for everything else, and the node being asked
// about is judged the same way the first one always was.
//
// ── WHY THE RESERVATION IS KEPT IN MEMORY AND NOT IN LOAD ──
//
// Memory is the resource that FAILS: a machine short of cores runs every build
// slower and finishes all of them, and a machine short of memory kills one or
// swaps until nothing finishes. And bounding admitted nodes by memory already
// bounds the CPU burst, because a footprint is at least one core's share of
// the machine's memory, so a quiet machine admits at most about one node per
// core — a compiler each is a machine's worth of load, not twenty machines'.
// The load half stays what it always was, the reading of a machine that is
// busy with somebody else's work, and the reservation adds nothing to it.
//
// ── IT GATES ADMISSION AND NOTHING ELSE ──
//
// Nothing running is ever touched. A node that has a worktree and a child
// agent keeps them however loaded the machine gets, because killing work to
// relieve pressure is how a run loses an hour to a coincidence — and because
// pressure DRAINS on its own: the running nodes finish, the reservation falls,
// and the next pass admits. A governor that could also stop things would
// need a policy for which; one that can only hold the next start needs none.
//
// ── SILENCE IS NEVER A HOLD ──
//
// The readings come from /proc, which is Linux's. A platform without it
// answers "cannot say", and a governor that cannot say NEVER HOLDS: a person
// on a machine this package cannot measure gets exactly the scheduler they had
// before the governor existed, which is the only honest thing to do with a
// number nobody took.
//
// ── ONE ACCOUNT FOR THE WHOLE PROCESS ──
//
// The visible half is this whole process and every descendant it started,
// because /proc cannot say which conversation started which compiler. A
// governor handed its OWN graph's count of running nodes therefore divided the
// whole tree's memory by one conversation's nodes: a second conversation's
// build, under way while this graph had two parts out, read here as three
// core-shares a node. And the measured footprint only rises, so that one
// reading narrowed every later fan in this conversation for the rest of the
// session. The same gap ran the other way on the reservation itself — each
// graph read the other's visible memory as covering part of its own — and both
// are issue #907.
//
// So THE COUNT THIS FILE IS HANDED COVERS EVERY LANE THE READING DOES, never
// one graph's. Both
// halves of `share = visible / running` and of `running × footprint − visible`
// are then read over the same population: every lane the process is running,
// and every byte the process holds above rest. Another conversation's build is
// counted as exactly what it is — memory held by lanes — against a divisor
// that already counts the lanes holding it, and no conversation can move
// another's per-node weight. The count comes from [TaskLanes] — one account,
// handed to every conversation the process opens ([Config.TaskLanes]) and
// written by every `TaskGraph.running` mutation through one door
// ([TaskGraph.takeLaneLocked], [TaskGraph.giveLaneLocked]). There is no clamp
// to a fraction of MemTotal, no timer decay and no per-graph correction,
// because the attribution gap is a fact about the machine the reading is of,
// and the account is kept where that machine is known.

// THE WALK FOLLOWS THE TREE DOWN from the root, through each thread's
// `children` file, rather than reading every process on the machine and
// sorting out whose is whose: what it reads scales with what this process
// started, not with how busy the box is — a full scan was measured at thirteen
// milliseconds on a machine running sixteen hundred processes, and this is
// the frontier's own goroutine. The kernel promises the children file exactly
// only for a tree that is stopped, so a process born or reaped as it is read
// can be missed, and that is the right precision for a figure that is re-read
// every second: a process missed once is counted by the next reading.
