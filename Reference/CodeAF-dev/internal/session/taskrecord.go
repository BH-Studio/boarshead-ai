// ONE ROW OF THE RECORD, READ DEEPER THAN THE WALK READS IT.
//
// [ReadWorld] carries what a project's index FILE says about a piece of work —
// its title, the state it came home in, what it cost, how many files it wrote,
// the branch or the worktree it left behind ([TaskIndexEntry]) — and that is
// everything a list of work draws. The CARD behind one of those rows draws one
// thing more: THE LAST THING THE NODE ITSELF SAID, which lives in the node's own
// journal and is not in the index at all.
//
// IT IS A SECOND READING AND NOT A FIELD ON THE WALK, and what decides that is
// what it costs. The walk is taken on a beat and answers five screens; a report
// is a forward scan of a whole session journal ([PeekReport]), and it is wanted
// for exactly ONE row — the one somebody just pressed. A walk that read every
// journal on the machine would be paying for four hundred reports to draw a list
// that shows none of them.

// TaskRecord is that reading: what the card knows about one piece of work beyond
// the row it was opened from.
//
// IT CROSSES THE WIRE AS ITSELF (internal/remote's Decision 1), because over a
// connection the journal is on the machine that ran the work and this surface
// has no way to open it — which is the whole reason the type exists rather than
// the card simply calling [PeekReport] on a path.
type TaskRecord struct {
	// Report is the last thing the node said, cut the way [PeekReport] cuts it,
	// and empty where the journal holds no report of its own.
	Report string `json:"report,omitempty"`
	// Kept says the journal the row names is STILL ON THE DISK OF THE MACHINE
	// THAT RAN THE WORK.
	//
	// IT IS A FACT AND NOT AN INFERENCE FROM AN EMPTY REPORT. A session folder
	// somebody deleted and a journal that never held a report are two different
	// sentences on a card, and only the machine holding the file can tell them
	// apart — a surface that guessed from an empty string would say "its
	// transcript is not on this disk any more" about a file that is sitting
	// perfectly well on the other one.
	Kept bool `json:"kept,omitempty"`
	// Journal is the END of the node's own transcript, whole lines, and nil
	// whenever the caller did not ask for any.
	//
	// IT IS BYTES AND NOT A PARSED PAGE. The journal's framing is one JSON object
	// per line and the surface already has the reader for it (internal/tui3's
	// readJournalLines), so a shape invented here would be a second parser that
	// has to agree with that one for ever — and Decision 1's whole bargain is
	// that a payload is the thing itself rather than a translation of it.
	//
	// IT IS A TAIL AND NEVER THE FILE. A node's transcript is megabytes and the
	// page that draws it keeps the last screenful of blocks anyway
	// ([ReadTranscriptBytes], shaped by tui3's roomReplay), so sending the whole of one would be paying a
	// connection for lines nothing will draw. The cut is made at a LINE BOUNDARY
	// — the first newline after it is dropped along with the partial line before
	// it — because a torn first line is a line the reader throws away and a
	// caller cannot tell that from a line that was never written.
	Journal []byte `json:"journal,omitempty"`
	// Beat is the node's pulse sidecar as the record itself names it
	// (task_store.go's taskRecord.Beat, written by task_beat.go), and "" for
	// every node that is not running one. IT IS THE RECORD'S OWN NAME FOR THE
	// FILE AND NEVER A PATH THIS SIDE COULD BUILD: a reader that recomputed it
	// from an id would be a second spelling of where the pulse lives, and the
	// whole bargain of the field is that whoever holds the record never has to
	// guess. Over a connection the file is on the machine that ran the work, so
	// the path crosses as data and is opened by whoever can reach it; empty on
	// the far reader is the honest answer and not a failure.
