package session

// BUILDING ONE, from the same sentence one is offered.
//
// harness.go is the question "did you mean the harness that already does this?".
// This file is the other half: "make me a harness that does this" — the turn
// that has no harness to match against yet, because the thing it is asking for
// does not exist.
//
// Until this file, that sentence went to the model, which answered it the way it
// answers anything: with prose about harnesses. The designer — the meta-guide in
// internal/subharness/prompts, the review pass that patches its draft, the
// validator that refuses a page the runner could not run — lived in a
// development rig (cmd/harness-design) and could not be reached from a
// conversation at all. The registry was a thing a person could run and could not
// fill.
//
// FOUR LAWS HOLD THE CHAT SIDE OF IT.
//
//   - THE INTENT IS THE MODEL'S JUDGEMENT, AND IT IS SPELLED AS A TOOL. This
//     path used to be entered by an anchored cue — "make|build|create|design a
//     (sub)harness for|to|that X" and nothing else — which was cheap and could
//     only ever read the sentences somebody happened to phrase that way. It is
//     now [Agent.buildHarnessTool] on the belt (tools_harness.go), so the
//     deciding is done once, by the thing that has the whole conversation in
//     front of it, and the goal it passes is a brief it wrote rather than the
//     tail of a sentence. Nothing below this line changed with it: the same job,
//     the same card, the same registry.
//   - THE TURN DOES NOT WAIT, AND THE DESIGN IS A TASK. A design is two model
//     calls against a twenty-five-thousand-token guide, and it is followed by a
//     QUESTION nobody may be at the keyboard for. Held in the turn loop that
//     would be a conversation frozen for a minute on work the person can watch
//     happen; so the turn ends the moment the design starts. WHERE it happens
//     is the work graph: harness_task.go admits a node whose body is this file,
//     so the design has a row, a room, a journal, an id and a stop, and the card
//     still arrives on the standing lane ([Agent.HarnessDesigns]) whenever it is
//     ready.
//   - NOTHING IS SAVED WITHOUT AN ANSWER. What comes back is a PAGE, drawn as
//     the card every surface shares (subharness.CardLines), and the registry is
//     untouched until somebody says yes. A design nobody answered is a design
//     that changed nothing.
//   - IT IS SILENT WHERE THE OFFER IS SILENT. No runner, no store, or no surface
//     that answers questions and this path does not exist — the tool is left off
//     the belt entirely ([Agent.canDesignHarness]), so the model does not have
//     the verb rather than having it and being refused.
//
// WHAT THE DESIGNER IS TOLD is not written here. The brief is the shared
// document (internal/subharness/prompts/designer.md) with THIS build's machinery
// rendered into it — the caps, both ladders, and the tool belt a harness may
// actually reach on this surface — so a guide that has drifted from the package
// it describes fails before the first request instead of in a bad design.

	//
	// IT DOES NOT COVER THE CARD, and it used to, which was a bug with a person on

	// waited for somebody to come back from lunch was collected at thirty minutes
	// and reported as having run out of time with nothing saved, while the page sat
	// finished in its own room. A card is a question on somebody's screen, and the
	// only things that may end one are their answer, their ✕, and the process
	// closing (harness_task.go's designHarnessNode).
	//
	// AND IT IS SPENT ONCE PER PAGE AND NOT ONCE PER JOB. A design is a
	// conversation — the person says what to change and the page is written again
	// — so every rewrite gets this window whole (harness_task.go's designRun.round
	// makes the argument). One clock over the whole job would expire in the middle

	// pair table walked "PAIR BY PAIR, IN WRITING, BEFORE YOU DRAW A SINGLE

	// that same number — and the ceiling was reached with content null, the whole
	// completion spent thinking, the attempt spent for nothing: measured on
	// deepseek-v4-flash, twice in three attempts. It was raised to 16000, with a
	// note saying headroom is not the whole answer and the number should not be
	// raised again without measuring. It is not raised again; it is gone. What
	// bounds a design turn is [harnessDesignWindow] and the session's own
	// provider timeout, and the other half of the old fix stands: the guide says
	// plainly that the derivation belongs IN the reply.

// ── the brief ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// harnessBriefs builds what the two turns are told: the meta-guide with this
// build's machinery rendered into it, and the same guide wearing the critic's
// addendum.
//
// THE REVIEWER SEES THE WHOLE GUIDE, because a critic that cannot see the law it
// is judging against would be reviewing its recollection of it — and the
// checklists in the addendum are the guide's own steps turned into questions.
//
// A guide whose placeholders have drifted from this package's numbers is an
// ERROR here, before the first request, rather than a stray brace in a prompt.

// ladders and the kind catalog are [subharness.Machinery]'s — the ONE map both
// doors read, so the next placeholder the guide renames cannot break only the
// standalone tool — and the belt is the one a harness may actually reach HERE.
//
// The belt is [HarnessBelt] — the wire tools plus whichever media verbs this
// machine has models for — and it is the SAME CALL the run resolves its nodes
// against (cmd/codeaf's chatv3_harness.go). harness_belt.go states what is
