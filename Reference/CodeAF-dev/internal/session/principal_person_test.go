// THE PERSON READS ONE READING THE WAY THE ENGINE ALWAYS DID, AND THIS IS THE
// PART A BUILD FAILS ON.
//
// [Person] exists so that an interactive session cannot tell that any of this
// arrived. That is a claim about behaviour, so it is written down as behaviour:
// a golden table of every end-of-turn a session can reach, and the answer the
// engine gave to each one BEFORE the interface existed, spelled out here rather
// than derived from the implementation under test.
//
// THE GOLDEN RULE IS [Agent.readRemains]'S OWN, verbatim: a reader with
// something to say re-opens the turn on exactly that line, and an empty reading
// ends the turn. Nothing else was ever consulted, so every row below carries
// landings, checks and an acceptance that would change a [Steward]'s mind and
// must change nothing here.
//
// EVERY ROW IS A FIRST READING, and that is the whole of what this table is
// about. The one law a person's principal has gained since is about the SECOND
// one — a reading that says what the last one said stops the turn (#888) — and
// it is read in TestAStandstillIsForgottenWhenThePersonSaysSomethingNew, which
// is why each row here is put to a principal of its own.
