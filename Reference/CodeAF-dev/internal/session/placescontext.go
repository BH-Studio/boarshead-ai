// WHAT AN ATTACHED FOLDER PUTS IN FRONT OF THE MODEL.
//
// places.go answers "which folders is this conversation about" and writes the
// answer down. This file is the half that was missing: THE MODEL BEING TOLD.
//
// The set fed the ground ladder (taskstands.go) and the standing trees
// (standingtree.go), and nothing else — so a person who picked a folder saw a
// dim line on their screen saying the pick had landed, and the very next request
// went out with no mention of it anywhere. The model then did the only thing it
// could: it went looking for the folder, usually by walking the home directory
// for a name that sounded right, and sometimes it found the wrong one. A
// DISPLAYED LINE IS NOT A MESSAGE, and this file is the difference.
//
// ── WHAT IT IS AND IS NOT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// AN ATTACHMENT IS A REFERENCE AND NOT A TREE. Nothing here reads a folder's
// contents, counts its files or walks it: the block names the absolute path, says
// the two cheap facts already on the record, and tells the model how to look —
// `ls` that exact path, `grep` for the file, `read` to open it. A chooser that
// pulled a repository into the prompt would spend somebody's whole context on a
// folder they may only have wanted one file out of.
//
// AN ATTACHMENT DOES NOT MOVE THE WORKING DIRECTORY. `Project`'s working
// directory is [Config.Workspace], it is captured at launch, and referring to a
// place has never moved it (places.go states that law and this block repeats it
// to the model, because a model told about a second folder with no ranking
// between them will guess at one).
//
// THE INSTRUCTIONS OF SEVERAL FOLDERS ARE NEVER BLENDED. An attached folder's
// own AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md is quoted under a heading that names ITS path and says
// in a sentence that it holds under that path and nowhere else. Two attached
// repositories with contradictory house rules is an ordinary thing to have open,
// and a prompt that ran their rules together would hand the model one composite
// project that does not exist.
//
// ── WHAT IT COSTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// IT RIDES message[0] AND IS REBUILT ONLY WHEN THE SET MOVES. A changed byte in
// message[0] re-prices the whole transcript at the uncached rate on the next
// request (memory.go's refreshSystemLocked states the law), so this is composed
// once per DELIBERATE ACT — a person attaching a folder, a person removing one,
// a conversation being reopened — and never per turn. That is the same trade the
// clock refresh already makes: a model reasoning about a folder nobody attached
// is worse than one re-priced conversation.
//
// A conversation with nothing attached renders NOTHING AT ALL, which is the
// emptiness law and also the ordinary state of nearly every conversation.

// attachedFileLimit is how much of ONE attached folder's instruction file rides
