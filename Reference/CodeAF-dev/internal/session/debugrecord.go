// The engine's end of the debug record (internal/trace says why it exists and
// what it costs when nobody asked for one).
//
// THE MODEL CALLS ARE RECORDED BY THE ADAPTER and the tool calls are recorded
// here, because those are the two doors every one of them passes through. A
// person reading a run's folder afterwards is reconstructing an alternation —
// the model asked for this, the machine answered that — and half of it written
// by one lane and half never written at all is the folder that sent somebody
// back to guessing.

// recordToolCall writes one tool call to the debug record. It is a no-op on
// every run nobody switched the record on for: [trace.For] answers nil in two
// atomic loads, which is what lets this sit at the tool chokepoint at all.
//
// A REFUSAL IS NOT A FAILURE, and the record says which it was. A tool a door
// refused never ran — the world never saw the call — and a record in which that
// reads like the tool failing is a record that sends somebody debugging the
// tool instead of the gate. The refuser's own name rides on the result from the
// one place every veto passes through (hooks.go's preAction).
