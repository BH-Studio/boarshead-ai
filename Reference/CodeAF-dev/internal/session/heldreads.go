// Held reads: a `read` call whose bytes are already verbatim in this
// conversation's transcript is answered with a one-line pointer instead of a
// fresh fetch from the file system.
//
// The measured defect: one planning chat issued ten reads of the same 5,180-line
// file as seventeen small slices, each a 30–90 second model round trip, and every
// slice was then re-billed on every later request. The model slices small because
// it prices tokens, not latency, and the tool contract says nothing about either
// — nothing told it a call costs a round trip, and nothing told it it already
// held the bytes. The ledger below is the answer to the second fact; the tool's
// own description (bare/tools.go's [readDescription]) is the answer to the first.
//
// ── ONLY THE LIVE TRANSCRIPT COUNTS AS HELD ──
//
// A result whose bytes left the transcript does not count as held, however the
// ledger remembers the read. STUBBING REWRITES THE RESULT'S TEXT (stub.go's
// [stubMarker]) AND FOLDING REPLACES THE MESSAGE OUTRIGHT (turnfold.go), so the
// claim does not trust its own record: each held span carries the fingerprint of
// the message text that carried those bytes, and a span whose fingerprint no
// longer names a live tool message is dropped right there. An incremental
// ledger that trusted its record would need every one of those rewrite seams to
// notify it; checking the transcript at the claim keeps the rule in one place.
//
// ── THE STAMP IS THE FILE'S OWN CLOCK ──
//
// Coverage is claimed only while mtime+size match what the last read saw. A
// changed file invalidates its whole entry by itself, so the fresh read the
// claim then falls through to REPLACES the entry rather than accumulating two
// generations of spans. Nothing here is persisted or crosses a session boundary
// — the ledger is this agent's, in memory, and a resume rebuilds it the way it
// rebuilt the transcript.
