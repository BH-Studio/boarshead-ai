package session

// placemeta.go keeps meta.json true while the conversation is happening.
//
// A session folder's identity file is what a picker reads instead of parsing
// every journal on the machine (place.go), and the two facts it exists to carry
// — WHEN THE PERSON LAST SPOKE and WHAT THE CONVERSATION IS CALLED — are only
// knowable from inside the running session. So this is where they are written,
// on the two lines that establish them: the person's own message, and the name
// the session gives itself.
//
// IT IS THE JOURNAL'S SEAM, NOT THE SURFACE'S. Every door — the terminal, the
// engine at the far end of an ssh pipe, a headless --once — records a user
// message through one place ([Agent.recordUserLocked]), and stamping there is
// what makes the resume order true whichever door was used. A surface-side
// stamp would have to be repeated in each of them, and the one that was
// forgotten would be a door whose conversations never come back.
//
// EVERY FAILURE IS SILENCE. meta.json is a citation and not the record: the id
// is the folder's name, the title and the last-active stamp are recoverable
// from the transcript, and there is nothing a person mid-sentence could do with
// the news that a lookup file could not be written. [LoadMeta] already answers
// a missing or corrupt file with a blank Meta, so a stamp over one is a stamp
// that rebuilds it.

// pressing Enter and their turn starting. Nothing in that write is something the

// when a person opens the home page, not while they are typing. So what happens
// on the path is the snapshot, and the disk is [offpath.Write]'s
// ([Agent.metaStamp]).
