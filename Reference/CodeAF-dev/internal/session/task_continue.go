// First-class continuation of a settled task.
//
// F23/F25: "continue task 4" used to re-derive a fresh brief and mint a new
// node through propose_task, paying for a new worktree and losing the failed
// worker's journal. The durable pieces were already on the node — the brief,
// the acceptance, the branch, the working-copy path, the journal, the
// checker's report. What was missing was a door that put THAT node back on
// the frontier.
//
// Continue is that door. It is [TaskGraph.interrupt]'s transformation reached
// by a person (or the model on their behalf) for any settled ending: same id,
// same spec, same tree, the last report handed back as this round's finding.
// A new propose_task is a different piece of work.

// which is a question the harness can answer for itself — and the answer is the
// same door a person would have reached for: run it again, from the branch it
// already has ([TaskGraph.reopen]).
//
// EXACTLY ONCE, AND THE SECOND ONE LANDS. A provider that is down stays down for
// the second attempt, and a brief whose world moved is still standing in the same
// world; a node that reran on every such ending would spend a person's money to
// be told the same thing until its deadline collected it.
