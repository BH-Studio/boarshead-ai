// world.go is the reading of EVERYTHING THIS MACHINE HAS EVER WORKED ON.
//
// Every other reader in this package is asked about one place. [Peek] is asked
// about one transcript, [RecentSessions] about one directory, [ReadTaskIndex]
// about one project's index — and each of them is the right shape for the
// question a session sitting in a directory asks. This file answers the other
// question, the one a person asks when they are not standing anywhere in
// particular: what is going on, everywhere.
//
// It is a READ AND NOTHING ELSE. Nothing here creates a directory, writes a
// file, takes a lock it keeps, or opens a journal for replay. The whole layer is
// four system calls per session — a directory read, meta.json, presence.json,
// and one flock asked as a question — over files that already exist, so it can
// be run on a keystroke and again on a tick without being a thing anybody has
// to budget for.
//
// Two laws shape what it answers with:
//
//   - A LIVE-LOOKING ROW IS NOT A LIVE ROW. The project's index is append-only
//     and a task takes its row when it starts; a machine that lost power, or a
//     codeaf that was killed, leaves rows on disk that say `running` forever.
//     So this layer never repeats a file's claim of liveness. It asks the
//     SESSION, through the presence file it refreshes every few seconds
//     (taskpresence.go): a `running` index row counts as running only when a
//     FRESH presence row for that conversation names that very node, and every
//     other live-looking row is [TaskRollup.Incomplete] — the word the
//     interrupted-task outcome already uses.
//
//     A session with no presence at all is a conversation held open by a build
//     older than that file, and there the old rule still stands: the kernel is
//     asked who holds the journal ([InUse], the same flock the sweep asks) and
//     its rows are believed. That is not a second law, it is the same one with
//     less to go on — presence says which nodes a session has out, the lock says
//     only that somebody has the session, and a reader uses the best answer it
//     was given rather than pretending to the better one.
//
//   - NOBODY HAS TO GO LOOKING FOR "THIS ONE NEEDS ME". A conversation stopped
//     on a question says so in its presence file ([SessionPresence.NeedsPerson])
//     with the one line it is stopped on, and that is the single most valuable
//     fact this layer carries: it is what puts a row at the top of its project
//     ([sortSessions]) instead of leaving it to sink under every idle chat
//     somebody opened since.
//   - THE BUCKET NAME IS NOT A PROJECT NAME. The directory under v3/projects is
//     a workspace path with its separators replaced by dashes, and that encoding
//     is one-way on purpose (cmd/codeaf's chatv3_layout.go: decoding it would be
//     guessing which dashes were separators). The path comes back out of the
//     sessions' own meta.json, which records it, and a bucket whose sessions
//     will not say answers with the encoded name unchanged rather than with a
//     guess dressed up as a fact.
