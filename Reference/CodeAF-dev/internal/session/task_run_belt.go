package session

// The chat's task door on the run engine: a
// `/task` under the bash belt starts a RUN rather than a node of this session's
// own tree. The conversation opens or reuses the store its plan lives in, seeds
// the work from the person's own sentence, hands the store to the run engine in
// a goroutine, and answers AT ONCE with the id the store knows the work by — so
// the person's conversation stays usable while the run goes, and the run's own
// page is the store's root rather than a node this session hosts.
//
// ── WHY THE ENGINE IS A SEAM AND NOT AN IMPORT ──
//
// The run engine ([internal/run]) is built ON this package: its crew factory
// hands every task to [NewBeltWorker] and its landing is [LandRunTree]. A door
// here that imported it would be the cycle the Go compiler refuses, so the
// engine is reached through [RunEngine] — a small interface this package owns,
// implemented by the engine and registered by it ([RegisterRunEngine]) — and a
// build with no engine registered answers the LEGACY road, which is the whole
// of what an unset switch does anyway.
//
// ── OWNERSHIP IS PER PROCESS ──
//
// The running run is held on the Agent ([beltRun]) and nowhere else. A second
// `/task` while one is live adds its work to that same store rather than
// opening a second one, because one store is one run (`plandb`'s own law: a
// store belongs to one root), and the becomes-live child is dispatched by the
// supervisor already turning. A conversation that has no live run seeds a fresh
// store for the new request, archiving the one it finds beside the session
// folder — a finished one as it ended, and one nothing was driving as
// interrupted — so a resumed conversation keeps reading every plan it had, and
// no request ever runs under another run's words ([Agent.openBeltRunStore]).

	// answered is only landing and settling now, which takes seconds, and work
	// added to its store in that time was never run: its row settled `failed`
	// with no report and no ending. So a hand-off that meets a run on its way
	// out waits for the run to be over and then starts a fresh one of its own
	// ([joinOrWait] is the whole of the decision).
	//
	// AND A PROGRAM NEVER JOINS A RUN AND NOTHING JOINS A PROGRAM'S. A program's
	// run is a run of one task whose worker owns its whole folder for the hour;
	// a second task beside it would be a bash worker typing in the tree the
	// program is editing, and a program added under a live run would be a second
	// worker beside the first. Both are refused with what is underway, and where
	// ([joinOrWait] again).
	//
	// ── ONE RUN PER BATCH ──
	//
	// STARTING A RUN IS ONE CRITICAL SECTION, from "is there a live run" to the
	// run being registered on the Agent, and every other hand-off waits at its
	// door ([Agent.lockBeltStart]). A message that proposes eight tasks, all
	// approved at once, commits eight hand-offs at the same moment, and without
	// this each of them found no live run — the run is registered only after its
	// store is open and its copy is cut, which takes seconds — and each opened or
	// set aside the same store. Measured on the owner's own session: two started
	// runs over one path, one run's worker filed its children into the other's
	// store, and the other six fell through to the older engine. Held here, the
	// first hand-off opens the run and the other seven find it live and join it
