// A SEAT'S NEXT CALL IS PRICED BEFORE IT IS MADE.
//
// A run's dollar limit is read off what its workers have already spent
// (internal/run's countLiveSpend), so a limit is reached only by the call that
// crosses it — and one long checker round on a dear model is many calls, each
// of which started under the line, so one checker round can overrun a small
// day's cap several times over before the limit is read. The guard answers the
// question BEFORE each call instead: what the day has spent, plus what this
// call is expected to cost, against the day's cap; and, for a seat given one,
// what the seat has spent on this task, plus this call, against its own
// ceiling. A call that would cross either is not made, and the call ends on
// the one sentence that says which line it met.
//
// The estimate is the call's prompt read at a token per four bytes, priced at
// the model's prompt price (its cache-read price once the seat has called it
// before, when the provider publishes one), and its completion ceiling priced
// at the completion price. What the call actually cost — the provider's own
// figure when it gives one, the tokens it reports priced otherwise — is added
// after, so the next estimate starts from the truth.

// SpendPrice is a model's price per token: prompt, completion and cache read.
// ok is false for a model whose price nobody knows; a line already reached
// still stops it. A known price of nothing is never stopped.
