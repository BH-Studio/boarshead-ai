// A BACKGROUND JOB PUBLISHES ITSELF, IN ITS OWN WORDS.
//
// THE LAW THIS FILE EXISTS FOR: a job is described by the facts a job actually
// has. It has an id, a command, a log file, a clock and — when it is over — an
// exit code. It does not have a brief, an acceptance, a ground, a branch, a
// worktree, a report anybody wrote, a price, or an agent inside it to be steered.
//
// WHAT WAS HERE BEFORE, AND WHY IT WENT. Jobs reached a surface as [TaskNotice]
// of kind `job`, because when jobs first needed to be visible at all the roster
// was the only door there was (jobrow.go's header still tells that story). The
// borrowing worked, and it cost three things that were paid every day
// afterwards:
//
//   - THE FACTS WERE PACKED INTO A SENTENCE. A job's id and log path travelled
//     as `job 3 · log /…/3.log` in the one string field a task row has for prose,
//     and two separate files in the surface cut it back apart on ` · log ` to get
//     at either half. A separator spelled in three places is a separator that
//     drifts, and a fact that has to be parsed out of a sentence is a fact the
//     sender knew and threw away.
//   - A JOB NEEDED A SECOND ID. Roster rows are keyed on the task graph's
//     sequence, so every job had one number minted from the graph to be drawn
//     under and kept its own registry number to be ADDRESSED by — `jobs kill 3`
//     takes the second and no surface could show it without the first. Two ids
//     for one thing, and a map between them to be kept in step.
//   - EVERY SURFACE DOWNSTREAM CARRIED A CLAUSE. `TaskKindJob` had to be excluded
//     from the project index, from the landing card, from the stop key, from the
//     roster's under-line and from the room's record rows — five files whose
//     entire content on the subject was that a job is not really one of these.
//
// SO A JOB IS PUBLISHED AS A JOB. The notice below is [jobInfo] — the snapshot
// the registry already copies out from under its own lock — made public, plus
// the name. There is NO NEW STATE ANYWHERE: [jobRegistry] remains the single
// source of truth about what is running, and this is a projection of it taken at
// the moment something moved.

// JobKind is what sort of background work a job is, in the one vocabulary a

//
// IT EXISTS SO A SURFACE NEED NOT READ THE NAME TO KNOW THE KIND. A watch and a
// render behave differently on a page — a watch has ticks and no ending, a
// render has an artifact at the end of it — and a surface that had to infer that
// from a label reading "watch app" would be parsing prose for a fact the engine
// already holds.

	// IT IS EMPTY UNTIL THERE IS ONE, and that is the emptiness law rather than a
	// gap: naming is an errand on its own goroutine and the work never waits for
	// it, so the first notice a job sends usually has no name on it at all. A
	// surface draws Command until Name arrives and then redraws. It is never the
	// id: `job 3` is the handle and is drawn beside the name, never as it.

// now. A conversation reopened tomorrow is drawn from rows saved by the codeaf
// that closed it — `job 3 · log /…/3.log` in a task row's prose field — so the
// choice is to read that sentence here or to tell every person with a
// conversation on disk that their history began today.
//
// SO IT IS PARSED EXACTLY ONCE, AT THE EDGE OF THE STORE. Two surfaces used to
// cut on this separator to get at either half; what made that a defect was that
// it was the LIVE contract. As a storage format read back in one function it is
// ordinary, and everything above this line still receives a [JobNotice] with the
// id and the path in fields of their own.
