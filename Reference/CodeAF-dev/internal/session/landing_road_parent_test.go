// THE LANDING ROAD, FROM THE CHILD'S FINISH TO THE PARENT'S NEXT ACTION.
//
// Every test here drives the real delivery — a node completed through the
// graph, [Agent.reportTaskNode], [Agent.deliverTaskNote] and
// [Agent.taskNoteReaders] — and asserts the PARENT WORKER's half: that the note
// reaches the worker rather than the person's conversation, that the worker is
// given a further round in which it can still act, and that a worker with
// nobody left in it falls back to the conversation rather than nowhere.
