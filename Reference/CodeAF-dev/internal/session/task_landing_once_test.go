// ── THE ONE ROAD HOME, AND THE ONE REFUSAL SETTLEMENT ──
//
// Both functions under test here exist because the thing they do was written out
// more than once, and a road with several copies is a road where a check added
// to one copy is a check the others do not get. These tests are about the SHARED
// shape rather than about any one caller: what a landing does, in what order, and
// what a refusal decides.

// A LANDING THAT HOLDS COMPOSES ITS REPORT IN ONE FIXED ORDER, whichever road
// asked for it. `head` leads, `tail` stands under it, and what the merge itself
// had to say stands under both — which is the shape every card, every project
// row and every parent's note downstream reads from the top.
//
// THAT A NODE SETTLES ONCE IS NOT THIS TEST'S CLAIM AND COULD NOT BE: this calls
// the landing directly. It is proved where it has always been proved, by the
// suites that drive the real runner end to end — task_progress_test.go,
// task_landing_test.go and task_test.go — none of which this change touches.
