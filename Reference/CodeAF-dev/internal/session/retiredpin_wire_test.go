// ── A PIN THE WIRE REFUSES IS RETIRED WHERE THE PERSON CAN SEE IT ───────────
//
// THE MEASURED FAILURE (2026-09-13, a real drive against the live router). A
// conversation on `routing: simple`, pinned to a machine the account's own
// settings exclude, sent the demand, collected the router's 404, retired the
// pin and answered from another machine — and said nothing. The status line
// dropped `@deepseek` between one turn and the next and no sentence anywhere
// explained why, which is the exact complaint the mode exists to close.
//
// THE PROOF IS AT THIS LAYER AND NOT AT THE TRANSPORT'S, because the transport
// already had a test of its own that passed. What it could not see is the rest
// of the road the sentence has to travel: the turn's own observer, the loop
// that reads the stream, the events a surface is handed. A fact that is emitted
// into a channel nobody in the product is listening on is a fact nobody is
// told.
