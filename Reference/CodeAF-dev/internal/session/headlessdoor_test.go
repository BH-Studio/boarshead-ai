// THE HEADLESS DOOR OF A RUN LEFT GOING (issue #535).
//
// A ceiling has appointed the same goal owner whether a conversation has a
// screen or not. These tests keep the door from changing which endings that
// owner reads: the mark ladder is the same on both doors, a handover is read
// before it seals, and a screenless session with nobody left in charge still
// pays for none of it.

// CONVERSATION, AND THE WATCHED CONVERSATION DOES NOT CHANGE.
//
// Both rows run the same grinding script through the whole ladder. The door is
// the only difference that matters here: the watched row has a person reading
// its events, while the headless row has the goal owner appointed by its
// ceiling. Each must read and journal the same three rounds, move the work once,
// and say the same handover line. The watched row must still gain no principal
// decision of its own.
