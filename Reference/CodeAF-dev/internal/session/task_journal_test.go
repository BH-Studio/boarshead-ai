// good only to the second — so two tests whose first node started inside one
// second were handed the SAME path, and [newAgent] either resumed the other
// one's transcript or, while the first still held the file's flock, refused the
// second outright. A design refused that way never wrote its page, and the test
// waiting for its card waited the full sixty seconds and failed.
