// BEFORE THE MONEY: WHO ELSE IS ALREADY IN THE FILES THIS WORK NAMES.
//
// taskclaims.go can already answer "who else is writing this path right now".
// This file is the one MOMENT that question is worth the most — the moment a
// brief is about to become a paid run. Two windows taking the same files is
// discovered today at land time, when both invoices have been paid and one of
// the two results is thrown away; asked here it costs one readdir and a loop
// over two path lists.
//
// ── WHAT IS KNOWABLE AT THIS MOMENT, AND WHAT IS NOT ──
//
// A brief says what to do and only SOMETIMES says where. Nothing here resolves a
// brief into the files it WILL write, because that is a promise no reader can
// keep — the same reason claims are facts and never intents. So the guess is
// narrow on purpose: the paths a brief SPELLS, and nothing else. A brief that
// spells none is answered with the one thing still true — somebody else is
// working in this project — and never with a guess about where.
//
// That narrowness is what makes the answer honest, and it is also the whole of
// what a caller may claim from it. THIS FILE NEVER SAYS "YOU ARE ALONE." An
// empty line means there was nothing to say, not that the files are clear: the
// brief may have named no paths, and another window's node may not have written
// anything yet ([Elsewhere.Touching]'s second list, which is why the cautious
// wording below exists at all).
//
// ── IT IS A FACT, NEVER A GATE ──
//
// Nothing here blocks, queues, waits or retries. The line it makes is read by
// the person on the proposal card and by the model in its tool result, and both
// are free to do nothing about it. A preflight that could stop a task would be
// one window's file steering another window's work, which is exactly the law
// taskclaims.go and the coordination design both refuse.
//
// ── AND IT MUST NOT BECOME WALLPAPER ──
//
// A warning that fires on every proposal is a warning nobody reads by Tuesday,
// so two rules keep it quiet. A word counts as a place only when it is SPELLED
// with a directory on it and ends in an extension, which drops prose, import
// paths and bare filenames in one move. And an overlap that lies only in the
// files every piece of work touches — go.mod, the lockfile, CLAUDE.md — is not
// an overlap worth a line ([hotFiles]).

// to head off has turned around — the task is about to work on top of edits its
