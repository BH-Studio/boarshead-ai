// The standing contract: how a conversation proposes a standing item to the
// person and hears the answer. It is the proposal half of internal/standing's
// contract, written by hand before the lanes started, in the shape
// task_contract.go already proved for propose_task.
//
// A STANDING ITEM IS A TASK WITH A WHEN. That is the whole framing, and it is
// why the card below is the task card with two more bands: when it wakes, and
// the daily allowance it shares. The proposal rides the same hub, waits on the
// same kind of answer channel, and is ignored when late for the same reason
// [Agent.ResolveTask] ignores a late answer.
//
// NOTHING STANDS UNTIL THE ANSWER IS YES, AND NOBODY PRESENT MEANS NO. A task
// proposal approves on silence because its work is bounded and watched; a
// standing item spends forever, which crosses the consequence gate. So the card
// carries NO clock while somebody is there to read it — it waits, and a turn
// that ends with it unanswered leaves nothing behind — and an unwatched session
// (a headless run, a firing) cannot ratify one at all. The session lane
// implements askStanding on that law.
