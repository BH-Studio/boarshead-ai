// THE GROUND A TASK IS CARVED FROM IS THE GROUND IT MERGES INTO.
//
// ── THE RUN THIS WAS WRITTEN FROM ──
//
// A chat turn edited the person's live checkout for seven minutes, and then the
// checkpoint ceiling moved what was left of it onto a task. The ground ladder
// did what it is written to do: it sealed the parent's tree AS IT STOOD into
// the task's base commit (groundladder.go's [sealGroundWork]) and left the
// person's checkout alone. So the same hunks then existed in two places — on the
// task's branch and, uncommitted, in the person's tree.
//
// At the landing the seal-stripping replay would not go, git refused the merge
// before it started ("Your local changes to the following files would be
// overwritten by merge"), and because a merge refused pre-start leaves no
// conflicted index, the one sentence the person read named NO FILES at all and
// ended in a bare colon. The node landed unverified over a conflict nobody could
// see.
//
// ── THE LAW ──
//
// CARRY OR REFUSE, NEVER CARRY-AND-LEAVE. If the seal carried uncommitted ground
// work, the landing has to be able to merge into that ground. So the merge sets
// the person's own work aside, merges, and puts it back — and when it cannot put
// it back over the merge, it puts the tree back EXACTLY as it was, refuses, and
// names the files. What it may never do is what it used to do: fail with a
// sentence that names nothing.
//
// ── WHY ONLY THE TRACKED HALF IS SET ASIDE ──
//
// `git stash push` with no `--include-untracked` moves the modifications git is
// already watching and leaves everything else on the disk untouched. That is the
// deliberate half:
//
//   - It is the half that blocks a merge for the reason this file exists — a
//     file changed on both sides — and the half a stash can put back with a
//     three-way merge it understands.
//   - An untracked file that would be overwritten is a DIFFERENT refusal from
//     git, and a stash of it cannot be put back over itself: the restore fails
//     with "already exists, no checkout" and the entry is left behind. Measured,
//     with the whole sequence in a scratch repository, before this was written.
//     So an untracked clash is refused and named rather than carried.
//
// ── AND THE UNDO IS THE POINT ──
//
// Everything here is reversible by construction: the pre-merge commit is read
// before anything moves, and every road that does not end in a landing ends with
// `reset --hard` back to it and the set-aside work put back on top. A restore
// that conflicts leaves markers, so it is never left standing — the tree goes
// back to the commit the stash was taken at, where the same restore applies
// cleanly, and the person is told the branch was kept.
