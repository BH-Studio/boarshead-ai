// EVERY COMMAND IS A STREAM, AND THE MODEL ALWAYS SEES WHERE ITS STREAMS ARE.
//
// These tests are written from one measured run. A scoring script took three to
// five minutes; the foreground bound was two; every call was adopted as a job;
// the script block-buffered its output so the job's log was zero bytes until it
// exited; and the model answered `sleep 30 && tail jobs/1.log` nine times to
// `(no output)` before killing work that was about to finish. Sixty-eight per
// cent of a ten-hour worker's wall clock went into that loop.
//
// Four things had to become true, and there is one test here for each.
