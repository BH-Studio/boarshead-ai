// THE SIX DOORS, WIRED TO THIS CONVERSATION.
//
// internal/exec's env.go is the whole capability surface a subharness has: six
// methods, and no seventh way to spend, reach out, or ask. This file is what
// those six reach on a surface that is a CONVERSATION somebody is sitting in
// front of — which is the half the old bridge never had, and the reason it had
// to write "nobody was there to ask, so it carried on" into its own trail.
//
// Each door rides a road this session already has. Nothing here is new
// machinery; what is new is that a program can reach them.
//
//	ai()        the session's model road — its client, its model, its ledger
//	tool()      the session's belt, filtered by the manifest's whitelist, and
//	            THROUGH THE SAME CONSENT DOORS any tool call goes through
//	ask()       the person, through the run's own question road, with the node
//	            moving to "awaiting your look" for as long as the question stands
//	remember()  the subharness's own memory, on the store lane's seam
//	recall()    the same
//	log()       the run's journal, its room, and the phase on its roster row
//
// ── THE TWO LAWS THIS FILE IS WRITTEN AROUND ──
//
// EVERY CALL IS JOURNALED BEFORE ITS ANSWER RETURNS. Not after, not on the way
// out: the entry IS the fact that the call happened, and a run killed mid-call
// has to leave behind exactly the calls it made — including the one that killed
// it. Every door below writes through [exec.Record] on both its paths.
//
// NOTHING IS EVER SILENTLY APPROVED. The named anti-pattern is the old bridge's
// auto-approving gate (internal/subharness's exec_model.go), which answered yes
// to every question because there was nobody to ask. Here a tool call the policy
// wants a person for goes to the person; a question the program puts goes to the
// person; and where there is genuinely nobody watching, the behaviour is what
// the gate DECLARED — a manifest default, or a stop — and never a guess.
