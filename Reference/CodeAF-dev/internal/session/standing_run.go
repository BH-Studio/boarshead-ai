package session

// The session side of a firing: how a standing item touches the world, how a
// cheap judgment decides whether it should, and how the news gets back to the
// conversation that asked for it.
//
// internal/standing owns WHEN — the pass, the rails, the ledger, the files.
// This file owns WHAT HAPPENS, because all three of those things are a session:
// a probe is the belt's own bash or the belt's own tool, a line delivered is a
// note in a conversation, and a task run unattended is an agent with a brief.
// Building any of them inside internal/standing would be a second harness.
//
// ── THE LIVE-WINDOW REGISTRY, AND WHERE A FIRING ACTUALLY LANDS ──
//
// A FIRING THAT NOBODY READS DID NOT HAPPEN. That is the whole law this half of
// the file serves, and it was written the hard way: a reminder made from home's
// `ask here` box fired into the EXCHANGE that had asked for it — an agent still
// open in the pane of a window whose person was sitting in an ordinary
// conversation two panes over — and they were never told. Had the exchange been
// closed it would have been worse: the note would have gone to the exchange
// folder's inbox, which no screen on this product reads, because an exchange is
// deliberately not a row on home.
//
// So [standingRunner.deliver] walks four roads, in this order, and stops at the
// first one that ends at a person:
//
//  1. THE ORIGIN CONVERSATION, IF IT IS OPEN HERE. The line goes onto the owed
//     steering queue a task's landing and a job's ending ride, so a person
//     sitting in the room hears about it in the room.
//  2. ANY OTHER OPEN CONVERSATION OF THE SAME PROJECT, most recently touched
//     first. The origin may be closed, or may be an exchange — and the window
//     the person is actually sitting in is a better address than a file.
//  3. THE ORIGIN'S OWN INBOX, folded under one "while you were away" the next
//     time they open it ([Agent.drainStandingInbox]). This is the right answer
//     for an item born in an ordinary conversation, which is a row somebody
//     comes back to.
//  4. THE PROJECT'S INBOX, for an item whose origin was an exchange. An
//     exchange is not a row anywhere, so its folder is a dead letter office;
//     the project's inbox is read by home and drained by the next ordinary
//     conversation opened in that project ([standing.ProjectInboxPath]).
//
// The registry below is the whole of "is it open here": a map from session id to
// the agent and the moment it registered, written by [newAgent] and erased by
// [Agent.Close]. It is deliberately tiny and holds nothing but that — a second
// index of sessions would be a second truth beside the folders that world.go
// already reads.
//
// AN ERRAND IS NEVER IN IT. [Config.Errand] marks home's `ask here` exchange,
// and [registerLiveSession] refuses one: it is a pane that closes with the
// screen, not a room. Its own card still ratifies, because a card is answered
// through the agent the surface holds and never through this map.
//
// ── WHAT AN UNATTENDED RUN IS ──
//
// A firing's task is an agent with no consent lane, and that is not a
// convenience: it is the law internal/standing states as "unattended means what
// was already allowed". Anything that would have asked a person refuses instead,
// the run stops, and the item says it needs them. So the run agent is built
// InTask — the same posture a task node runs in — which is what turns "somebody
// would have to approve this" into one honest line rather than a hang.

//
// ── WHY THE PLACE NOBODY IS WATCHING IS THE PLACE THIS MATTERS MOST ──
//
// A firing is the person's own work done while they are asleep, and until this
// it was the ONE road on which width was unaddressable: `ActionTask` ran
// strictly sequentially inside a single turn, however many separate items the
// brief named. "Every night, bring the eleven adapters up to the new interface"
// is exactly the shape [splitgate] was measured on, and it was the one shape
// that could not take the road.
//
// ── ENUMERATION ONLY, AND THAT IS THE HONEST FLOOR FOR UNATTENDED WORK ──
//
// Ordinary work has three signals ([Agent.armDivision]) and a firing has one of
// them, because the other two are people. The sizing judge answers a sentence
// somebody has just typed and is waiting on; a chat model's `wide` is that same
// judgement made with the whole conversation in front of it. A firing has
// neither: its brief was compiled from a sentence the person said once, ratified
// on a card, and has been sitting in a file ever since. ASKING A MODEL HERE WAS
// CONSIDERED AND REFUSED — a sizing read is a model call, a firing is a
// recurring bill on a rhythm the person set rather than a piece of work they
// asked for now, and a call made every night forever to answer a question about
// a sentence that has not changed since the last time is a subscription nobody
// agreed to. What is left is the signal that is FREE and reads the work's own
// text, and it under-arms rather than over-arms: [splitgate] counts a number
// only where it stands beside one of the item-nouns it knows, so a brief has to
// have named its width in words before this says yes.
//
// AND THE GATES STILL DECIDE AT RUN TIME. Arming is only permission to ask: a
// firing that turns out to be narrow, or lands on a machine with no free lane,
// gets the same two answers any worker gets (task_divide.go), and a small firing
// that was never armed is byte-identical to what it was before this existed —

// otherwise try to start in a worktree the work that is already under way. What
