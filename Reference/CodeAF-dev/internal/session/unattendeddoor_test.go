// THE DOOR OF AN UNATTENDED RUN, AS TESTS (issue #513).
//
// Three cells — one model, `--yolo`, a wall — each finished their work, went
// green on the tree, and still ran to the wall with their top task reading
// "needs you". One shape, three laws, and this file holds the laws that are not
// already at home somewhere else:
//
//  1. A HANDOVER IS AN ENDING. The three roads that seal a running turn — a
//     split at a mark, the write seam, the ceiling — put the same reading to the
//     session's goal owner that a stopped turn does, before they seal
//     (checkpoint.go's [Agent.endTurnUnderSteward]).
//  2. A LANDING THAT CANNOT COME HOME FOR A REASON ABOUT THE TREE IS NOT OFFERED
//     AGAIN. The tree half of that lives in task_unsaved_test.go, beside the law
//     it amends; the conflict half — the reason that IS about the work, which
//     still goes back to somebody — is here as the control.
//  3. A CHECKER'S WINDOW IS SPENT ON CHECKS, NOT ON ONE HUNG CALL, and a check
//     that could not run is decided by the posture rather than handed to a
//     person who is not there.
