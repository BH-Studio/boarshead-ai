package session

// WHERE A TASK STANDS.
//
// A conversation opened in a home directory spent an hour fixing two security
// findings in a repository three levels down, and every piece of machinery
// underneath believed the work was about the home directory. The harness minted
// an empty repository beside the session, cut both workers a worktree from THAT,
// and the brief — written by a model that could see the real project — told them
// to go and work in the person's own checkout instead. So the guard that keeps a
// task off a real branch was guarding a copy nobody was in; two commits landed on
// the person's own branch; and the check that decides whether work is finished
// was run in the empty tree, found nothing, and marked both tasks incomplete
// while their pull requests sat open and correct (issue #76).
//
// Nothing there was a bug in isolation. The parts disagreed about ONE FACT
// nobody had ever written down: which repository or folder the work is about.
// This file is that fact, and it is called the GROUND.
//
// ── THE LADDER ──
//
// It is resolved from evidence the conversation already holds, in this order,
// and the first rung that answers wins:
//
//  1. SAID — `propose_task{ground}`, the place a person named in their own
//     request. Somebody's own word is never overruled by anything below it.
//  2. BRIEF — the unique existing folder that contains every existing place the
//     task's own contract writes down. Existence, containment, and uniqueness
//     decide this rung; no spelling convention or kind of artifact does.
//  3. CONVERSATION PLACES — places this conversation is already about
//     (places.go). A folder resolved once is not asked about twice.
//  4. TOUCHED — the git roots of every path this conversation's tool calls read,
//     edited, grepped or wrote, and every `cd` a shell command made, weighted by
//     recency. One root that dominates is the ground. TWO WITH REAL WEIGHT ARE A
//     QUESTION, never a coin toss: the caller is handed the two names and asks.
//  5. STANDING IN — the conversation's own workspace when it is a repository.
//     This is what every task got before this file existed, and a session opened
//     inside the project it is about still gets exactly it.
//  6. NOTHING — the conversation's own folder, with no repository anywhere. The
//     work happens there because there is nowhere else it could be about.
//
// ── AND THE MODE FALLS OUT OF THE DELIVERABLE ──
//
// Nobody is asked "worktree or copy?", because that is a question about
// machinery and the answer is already in what the work must leave behind
// ([TaskMode] spells the five out). A repository the work writes in gets a
// branch off its HEAD; a repository it only reads stays read-only and the work
// gets a folder; a plain folder it writes in is mirrored and landed back by
// name; and "here" is the person saying they want it in their own tree.
//
// ── THE NAME ──
//
// taskground.go is about the ground MOVING while a run is out — somebody else
// landing work in the files this node is writing. This file is about the ground
// a task STANDS ON. Neither name is spare, so the two live apart and this
// paragraph is the signpost between them.

//     directly` while the harness had cut a worktree somewhere else.
//   - IT IS IN NO REPOSITORY, AND THE DELIVERABLE NAMES IT, AND IT IS A PLACE ON
//     THIS MACHINE. Then the task is asking to leave its work somewhere it does
//     not stand, and it is refused in one sentence rather than started and
//     guarded to death. A path is a place here only when a directory along it
//     exists ([placeOnThisMachine]); a name whose whole chain is absent is a
//     path on another host or one the contract merely quotes, and neither is a

// A path only the BRIEF names, in no repository, is left alone: briefs quote
// interpreters, log files and system directories constantly, and refusing work
// over `/usr/bin/python3` would be a lint that people learn to write around.

// names nothing on this machine.
//
