// A LANDING'S CLAIMS ARE ITS CHECKLIST.
//
// ── WHAT WENT WRONG WITHOUT THIS ──
//
// A run on 2026-08-31 produced a diff whose own documents said a string had been
// taken out of the surface, while the function that returns that string was
// still there and still being called. Three artifacts — a change note, a page of
// prose and the comments around the code — asserted a state of the world the
// code did not have, and every gate the build owns waved them through, because
// every gate the build owns asks whether a NAME is mentioned and never whether
// the sentence around it is true. The check that followed judged the work
// against its acceptance, which the work met; nobody had asked whether what the
// landing SAID about the world was so.
//
// So the law: every completion report is a list of claims, and checking is
// hunting each claim in the ground. What a landing asserts is exactly what a
// reader will believe without looking, which makes it the most expensive thing
// in the change to get wrong and the cheapest thing in the change to test.
//
// ── DOMAIN-NEUTRAL, BECAUSE THE WORK IS ──
//
// Nothing here knows what a repository is, and nothing here is about code. "The
// page no longer says X", "the three follow-ups were sent", "the table has forty
// rows" are all claims, and all of them are settled the same way: read what the
// claim asserts, then go and look. Two shapes are settled by this file on its
// own because they are settled by LOOKING —
//
//   - a claim that a string is gone is a search of what would ship;
//   - a claim that something under a named place was updated is a question about
//     which files the landing wrote.
//
// A claim that a BEHAVIOUR changed cannot be settled by looking; it has to be
// run, and running things is what the checker with a shell is for. So this file
// does not guess at those: it hands them to the checker as a written checklist
// and asks for any it could not settle by name.
//
// ── AND A CLAIM NOBODY SETTLED IS SAID OUT LOUD ──
//
// The failure this file exists for is a false claim passing SILENTLY, so the one
// thing it may never do is drop a claim on the floor. A claim the ground
// contradicts is a finding. A claim nothing settled is named in the report as
// one nothing checked. Only a claim that was actually hunted and held goes quiet.

// into it. Before this, the check was handed the parent's OWN list — the files
// one worker touched — so the parts' work was laid over the ground as though it
// had always been there, and the biggest artifact of a divided run was the one
// thing nothing looked at. The parts were each checked, correctly, and then the
// tree they were assembled into went home unexamined.
//
// A DIVIDER IS A PART LIKE ANY OTHER. Its deliverable is the assembled tree, so

//
// ONLY A PART THAT LANDED COUNTS. A part that was refused kept its branch and
// never merged, so its files are not in the parent's tree and claiming them would
// be the check standing on work that is not there.

// IT IS READ FROM THE PARTS RATHER THAN INTO THEM, and that is what makes it
// safe to call on a ledger that has ALREADY absorbed them (task_ledger.go). The
// parts are whatever the graph says landed; own is the rest of the list. So a
// re-audit handed the complete family ledger still sees its own half as its own
// and its parts' half as its parts', and `Files it wrote:` stays a true claim
// about this node however many times the list has been folded.

// than a detail. It used to be filed under the node, which cannot survive being
// asked twice: the second reading has no way to tell a path the node wrote from
// one it absorbed, so the split would drift with every re-audit. Filing it with
