// THE STORE RECORDS LIVENESS AT THE CADENCE OF THE WORK.
//
// ── THE HOLE IT FILLS ──
//
// tasks.json is written at ADMISSION and at LANDING (task_store.go), and between
// those two moments a node can spend eleven minutes doing anything at all. From
// outside the process the row says `"state": "running"` and nothing else, so a
// node calling a model every twenty seconds and a node wedged on a build that
// will never return are the same two bytes on disk. Every reader that needed the
// difference invented its own answer: the marathon runner reconstructs liveness
// from the mtimes of the node journals, a second window has the session's
// presence file (taskpresence.go) and its five-second clock, and anybody holding
// only the checkpoint has nothing.
//
// So each RUNNING node writes its own pulse, and everything that wanted to know
// gets it for free.
//
// ── WHAT IT SAYS, AND WHEN ──
//
// Three facts and no more: WHICH PHASE the node is in, WHEN ITS LAST REQUEST
// STARTED, and WHEN THAT REQUEST CAME BACK. Together they answer the only
// question an outside reader is really asking — is this thing moving — without
// anybody having to model what "moving" means: a request that started four
// minutes ago and has not come back is a node inside a long call, a request that
// came back four minutes ago with nothing since is a node inside a long tool, and
// a row whose numbers are seconds old is a node working normally.
//
// IT IS WRITTEN AT EVERY PROVIDER CALL BOUNDARY, which is the cadence of the work
// itself rather than a clock somebody chose: loop.go takes the pulse either side
// of [Agent.completeWithRetry], the one line in this package where a worker's
// request actually goes out, and the node's call trail takes it at the two ends
// of every request made ON the node's behalf (task_calltrail.go) — the reading
// that sizes the work, which ran for 219 seconds on 2026-09-11 over a pulse that
// said `"requests": 0`. There is no ticker, nothing to start and nothing to stop,
// so a node that is genuinely wedged writes nothing new — which is the news.
//
// ── A SIDECAR, NOT THE CHECKPOINT ──
//
// tasks.json is the graph, whole, re-encoded and atomically replaced on every
// write; putting a pulse in it would mean re-serializing every node in the family
// a few times a minute and racing every landing that does the same. So the pulse
// is a FILE PER NODE, two hundred bytes, beside the node's own transcript:
//
//	<session folder>/tasks/<id>.beat.json
//
// The store owns the name ([taskStore.beatPath]) and the row names the file
// (task_store.go's taskRecord.Beat), so a reader that has tasks.json open never
// has to guess at a path — and a reader that only has the directory finds the
// pulse sitting next to the transcript it was already reading mtimes off.
//
// ── AND STALENESS IS THE CLEANUP ──
//
// The file is removed when the node lands, because the checkpoint's own row is
// the authority the moment there is a final state to read. A process that is
// killed removes nothing, and a beat left behind is read exactly as
// taskpresence.go reads a stale presence file: by its age, which is the only
// thing that was ever true about it. A write that fails is dropped in silence,
// for [appendTaskIndex]'s reason — a node must not stall or fail because a
// two-hundred-byte courtesy could not be written.
