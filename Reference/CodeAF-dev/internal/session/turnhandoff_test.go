// A TURN THAT HANDED ITS ASK OFF IS FINISHED; THE ASK IS SOMEBODY ELSE'S NOW.
//
// THE MEASURED FAILURE these cases are written from: a live run on 2026-09-04.
// The person typed "Please hand this work to a task: run ./slow-build.sh, wait
// for it to finish, and tell me the marker it wrote to build.log. Start it now;
// keep the main conversation available while it runs." The turn proposed the
// task, said it had started and that the conversation stayed free, and stopped.
// The end-of-turn reader was asked whether the ASK was finished, said no —
// truthfully, the build was still running — and the turn was re-opened with
// [checkpointCarryOnNote]. With nothing left to do the model polled `tasks` and
// started a watch over its own running task.
//
// The cases below drive [Agent.Submit] rather than calling the gate, because
// what the failure cost was whole turns.
