// Written from two commands that really ran, in one benchmark cell, from two
// different workers of the same family:
//
//	cd <its own worktree> && git merge --ff-only main
//	cd <its own worktree> && git merge task/pr-validation-workflow-issue-20-5d1af9 --no-edit
//
// The first fast-forwarded a part onto a branch that already held the upstream
// project's own fixes for the issues that part had been asked to fix, and the
// part then reported the work as done. The second was a parent merging a
// sibling's branch by hand, which is the landing road's job (task_run.go's
// comeHome). Both ran INSIDE the node's own worktree, on the node's own HEAD, and
// touched no path outside it — which is why the guard is written about refs and
// not about directories.
