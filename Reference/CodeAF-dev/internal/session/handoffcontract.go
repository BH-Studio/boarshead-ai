// THE HANDOFF CONTRACT: A BRIEF, A GROUND, AND SOMETHING CHECKABLE BETWEEN THEM.
//
// ── THE RUN THIS WAS WRITTEN FROM ──
//
// A dividing parent wrote excellent briefs. They named exact files and exact
// symbols of the world it had just built: "taskstrip.go is gone; the survivors
// live in taskchip.go (stripKey, ParentID…)"; "hover.go lost hoverStrip and
// gained hoverYolo". Every one of those sentences was TRUE OF THE PARENT'S
// WORKING TREE and false of the folder its workers woke up in. A cheap worker
// then spent twenty-two minutes and $7.99 rewriting a test file for a component
// its own brief said had been deleted, four lines at a time, until the step cap
// killed it.
//
// The ground law next door (groundladder.go) is half of the answer and was the
// direct cause here. The other half is this file, and it is the half that
// survives every OTHER way a brief and a world can come apart: a re-grounded
// task, a folder somebody moved, a dependency that finished after the brief was
// written, a person editing between the proposal and the approval.
//
// ── THE LAW ──
//
// A HANDOFF IS A BRIEF, A GROUND, AND A CHECKABLE MANIFEST — AND THE WORKER'S
// FIRST SPEND IS VERIFYING THE CONTRACT. A mismatch must be an instant,
// costless, DIAGNOSABLE landing that names what was missing, rather than an
// expensive loop nobody can read afterwards.
//
// ── THE SHAPE, AND WHY IT HAS NO DOMAIN WORDS IN IT ──
//
// An expectation is A PLACE, and optionally SOMETHING THAT MUST BE FINDABLE IN
// IT, and whether it must be there or must not. That is the whole taxonomy, and
// it is deliberately not a list of kinds: a file, a folder, a note, an asset, a
// dataset and a transcript are all places, and a symbol, a heading, a column
// name and an identifier are all text inside one. A schema that enumerated
// "symbol", "column", "url" would be codeaf deciding in advance what domains it
// works in, which it does not get to do.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT REACH, said out loud: an expectation codeaf cannot check
// against a directory — a URL that must fetch, an account that must still be
// logged in — is not accepted here, because the value of the manifest is that
// every line of it is answered before the money is spent. Those belong in the
// brief's prose, where they already went.
//
// ── AND IT IS NEVER INVENTED ──
//
// NOTHING IN THIS FILE WRITES AN EXPECTATION. The divider writes them, because
// only the divider knows which sentences of its own brief are load-bearing. A
// harness that mined paths out of the prose would be guessing at what the brief
// meant and then landing somebody's work on the guess — and it would be wrong
// in exactly the direction that is most expensive, since a brief mentions many
// paths and depends on few. A brief with no expectations preflights nothing and
// costs nothing, which is the honest default and the common case.

	// Path is where to look, relative to the folder the work is about or

	// nothing can answer, and this file's header says why that is refused
	// rather than carried.
	Path string `json:"path"`
	// Holds is text that must be findable at Path — a symbol, a heading, a
	// column name, an identifier. Empty asks only that the path is there.
	Holds string `json:"holds,omitempty"`
	// Absent turns the expectation around: this path must NOT be there. It is
	// how a divider says "the file you are thinking of is gone", which is
	// exactly the sentence the run this was written from got wrong.
	Absent bool `json:"absent,omitempty"`
	// Fact is the assumption in the divider's own words, and it is optional

// expectsSchemaJSON is the `expects` property, and BOTH doors that take a brief
// from a model carry it: the divider's (task_divide.go) and the conversation's
// (task.go). It is ONE constant interpolated twice rather than two literals,
// because a second account of the same shape is how a field comes to mean one
// thing at one door and something else at the other.
//
// THE SECOND DOOR WAS PAID FOR AND NOT BORROWED, said here because this is
// where somebody will look for the reason. propose_task's schema rides in front
// of every request of every turn of every conversation and is the heaviest tool
// on that belt, so this text reached it only once its 1,230 bytes had been
// taken back out of prompts/system.md: four lines whose every clause the tool
// block already carried, each in the description of the tool it was about
// (prefixbudget_test.go states that law, and is what would have failed).
//
// The asymmetry between the doors is real and was never the argument: a divider
// writes a brief about a world its reader has not been given yet, while a
// conversation proposing a task can see the folder it is proposing against —
// and a conversation proposing work against a folder it has NOT opened, or
// against a project three directories away, is the same handoff this file was
// written from. Nothing below cares which door filled the list.
//
// IT IS WRITTEN FOR DENSITY, like everything else that rides in front of every
// request: each rule is stated once, in the field it governs.
