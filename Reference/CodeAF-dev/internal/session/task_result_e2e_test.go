// finding a continuation is handed, and through a checkpoint into a session
// that was not running when the work happened.

// The answer is deliberately on LINE FOUR of what the worker says. Three lines
// of preamble and then the thing that was asked for is the ordinary shape of a
// model's answer, and it is exactly the shape the card's three-line preview
// cuts off — so a test whose answer is on line one would pass against a build
// that had never kept a result at all.
