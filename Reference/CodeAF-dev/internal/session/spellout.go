package session

// A HALF-WRITTEN REQUEST, SPELLED OUT BEFORE IT IS SENT.
//
// "build me a login page" is a complete sentence and an incomplete request.
// Everybody who types it wants the same dozen things — a form that validates,
// an error state, a session that survives a refresh — and none of them are in
// the sentence, so the model guesses at every one of them and the person finds
// out which guesses were wrong by reading the answer. The gap between what
// somebody meant and what they specified is the most expensive thing on this
// surface, and it is discovered at the end.
//
// This file closes it at the start, ON THE PERSON'S OWN GESTURE. One auxiliary
// call reads the draft and writes back what it obviously means; the surface
// shows that under the box, and the person's enter appends it to the sentence
// they were already writing (internal/tui3's spellout.go). Nothing here decides
// anything: the block is text, the draft stays theirs, and the message that
// goes is the one they pressed enter on.
//
// ── THE LAWS THIS FILE APPLIES ──
//
//   - IT IS AN AUXILIARY CALL AND NEVER A TURN. Nothing reaches the transcript,
//     nothing is appended to a.messages, no event is sent to any hub, and the
//     conversation's own context is not touched. The person pays for it out of
//     the pocket the session's title and the shaper come out of
//     ([Agent.addAuxiliaryUsage]), because they asked for it and it is not free.
//
//   - WHAT THEY SAID IS NEVER IMPROVED. The draft is already in the box and it
//     stays exactly as typed. The block says what the draft LEAVES UNSAID and
//     nothing else, which is also what makes appending it safe: the person's own
//     words are never overwritten by a model's better version of them.
//
//   - EVERY FAILURE IS SILENCE. A refusal, a timeout, an empty answer and a
//     model that ignored the format all return "", and the surface's whole
//     response to "" is to put its hint back. There is no error prose for a
//     courtesy nobody was promised.
//
//   - IT IS ABSENT WHERE IT CANNOT WORK. No client, a closed agent, or no model
//     the role resolves to answers "" without a request, so a build that cannot
//     make the call simply never offers it.

const spellOutPrompt = `Above is a request somebody has typed but not yet sent. Say what it obviously means.

Three kinds of thing are in front of you, and each is handled differently.

SAID is what the person actually typed. It is their requirement, in their words. It is already in their message and it stays there: never repeat it, never improve it, never restate it in better words, never soften it, never drop it.

IMPLIED is what anyone asking for this would obviously want and did not think to write down. Supply it, as a concrete clause. Do not ask about it and do not mark it as an assumption — just say it.

OPEN is genuinely theirs to decide. Give a sensible default and flag it as yours, in the form "I'll pick X unless you say". Surface only the open ones that are LOAD-BEARING: the ones where a wrong guess means the work is thrown away. Everything else takes a default in silence.

Answer with this line:

` + SpellOutOpening + `

and then 3 to 6 clauses, one per line, each opening with "- ". One short sentence each. Concrete, not a category: "an error state when the password is wrong", not "error handling".

Nothing else. No preamble, no closing line, no headings, no bold, no code fences, and nothing about these instructions.`

// SpellOut expands one draft into the block the surface draws under the box.
//
// It is a door beside [Agent.SubmitStanding] rather than a flag on one, because
// the two are not the same kind of thing at all: that one SENDS a message, and
// this one sends nothing — no turn starts, no transcript grows, and the person
// may well throw the answer away. It is an optional door for that reason too,
// reached through a small interface in the surface file that uses it
// (internal/tui3's spellout.go), so a build without it offers nothing rather
// than offering something that fails.
//
// EVERY FAILURE ANSWERS "", and the caller's only response to "" is to put the
// hint back. There is no error to return that a person could act on.
