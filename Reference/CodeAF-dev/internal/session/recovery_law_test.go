// ── ONE BUDGET, SAID ABOUT THE SESSION ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// internal/provider has held this law since #858 (dispatch_law_test.go) and it
// covered that package ONLY, for a reason stated in its own comment: six
// ladders in this package still counted their own attempts, each bounded, none
// of them reading the plan under it. Those six are folded
// (docs/design/recovery/DESIGN.md §7) and the law reaches here now.
//
// WHAT IT IS FOR. A count of tries above a transport that is already bounded by
// a deadline does not bound anything — it MULTIPLIES. The census of 2026-09-10
// measured the product: chains of sixteen and seventeen identical sends running
// eleven minutes and ending refused, under budgets each of which was correct on
// its own. There is one bound and it is `lane.Role.GiveUp` in the person's own
// time, scaled by the one thing they may turn (`response.attempts`).
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT FOR, and the allowlists below are the whole of it: a count of
// THINGS is not a count of TRIES. Every entry names a function or a constant and
// says in one line what it counts instead.

// countsTries are the loops in this package that may count, each with the thing
// it is counting that is not a try.
//
// A REPAIR ROUND IS NOT A RETRY, and that is four of these five. A retry sends
// the same request again and hopes the wire behaves; a repair round sends a
// DIFFERENT request — the model's own malformed answer, handed back with a note
// saying what was wrong with it — so "one draft and one repair" is a count of
// drafts, and a deadline in its place would buy the same full-price call over
// and over for an answer that is not going to parse.
