// THE QUICK ROAD OUT OF A CHECKPOINT: a turn that only READ is handed to a
// quick node, and the drawing is the brief.
//
// ── WHAT THE OTHER ROAD BUYS, AND WHAT IT COSTS ──
//
// checkpoint.go's handover buys supervision: a fresh copy of the folder, a brief
// written by somebody who did not spend the turn, a checker reading the result,
// and a landing. Every one of those is worth its price when the turn being moved
// has been CHANGING THINGS — that is writeseam.go's whole argument, and the run
// it was written from was forty-eight edits in somebody's live checkout.
//
// None of it is worth anything to a turn that has read forty files and written
// none. There is nothing to isolate, because nothing was touched; nothing to
// merge, because there is no branch; nothing for a checker to judge, because the
// answer IS the last message. What the person is waiting for is the reading,
// done faster, and the full road makes them wait longer for it: two model calls
// to write a brief the drawing already is, a worktree they will never open, and
// an audit of a paragraph.
//
// ── SO THE READING IS THE WHOLE OF THE DECISION, AND IT IS A COUNTER ──
//
// The gate is [writeMeter.untouched] — the same counter the write seam prices
// its allowance against, read for zero instead of for five. It is deliberately
// not a second reading of what the turn was ABOUT: a turn is research because it
// did not touch the disk, which is a fact the harness already holds, and any
// judgement of the subject would be the content-sniffing checkpoint.go's header
// refuses in the same breath as the marks themselves.
//
// AND THE DRAWING STILL DECIDES THAT THERE IS ANYTHING TO HAND OVER. The road is
// only entered where the mark's reader drew independent parts
// ([checkpointSketch.split]), exactly as the full road is: a turn with one long
// job left in front of it is not made better by being restarted somewhere else,
// whichever kind of node takes it.
//
// ── THE ITEMS ARE THE PARTS, AND THAT IS WHY NO BRIEF IS WRITTEN ──
//
// A quick node has a `line` and `items` and nothing else to open on
// (docs/design/quick-task/DESIGN.md). The line is the person's own sentence — the
// one document on this road nobody writes — and the items are the drawing, read
// out in the order it was drawn. That is already the account of what is left, so
// [Agent.writeHandoff] is not called and the carry ladder is not walked: a
// ninety-second call to a second model, to produce a paragraph the items say
// better, is the exact wait this road exists to remove. The ceiling row says
// `quick` where it would otherwise name a rung ([carryRungQuick]).
//
// AND [taskSpec.drawn] IS LEFT ZERO. The parts are the items of ONE worker
// working through them in order; carrying the drawing as well would put the same
// parts to `divide_work` and hand them out a second time
// (task_divide_sketch.go's [Agent.sizeBeside]).

// checkpointQuickNote is the ONE line a person reads when a write-free turn's

// line under it (route_judge.go's [Agent.launchRouteTask]).
//
// IT IS ONE LINE BECAUSE THERE IS ONE EVENT. The two lines exist on the full
// road because two things happen there that a person has to be told apart: their
// turn was moved, and then a task was started somewhere else with a copy of the
// folder. Here the second half is the interesting half and it is not somewhere
// else — the work carries on in the folder they are standing in — so saying it
// twice would make one small thing sound like two large ones.
//
// IT KEEPS THE REGISTER of the family it joins ([inTheHouseRegister]): an
// observation, a middle dot, a promise, lowercase, no full stop, no machinery.
// The observation is the ceiling's own, because the ceiling is what moved this.
// The promise is the honest one for this node and is deliberately narrower than
// the other two: not "watched", not "can split", but WHERE the work is happening
// and WHAT IT TOOK WITH IT — here, in this folder, holding the transcript — which
// is the whole of what distinguishes a promotion from the task the person might
// otherwise assume started, and the half a person could not otherwise see
// (inherit.go).

// comes through ([Agent.admitQuick]), and this road only says what it knows.
//
// EVERY CLAUSE IS A FACT THE HARNESS ALREADY HOLDS, and none of them is a
// reading of anybody's words:
//
//   - THE TURN WROTE NOTHING. [writeMeter.untouched], the write seam's own
//     counter, read for zero. It is the one question that decides between a
//     worker in a copy of the folder and a worker where the person stands, and
//     it is asked in exactly one place in this build — writeseam.go owns the
//     isolation question and fires FIRST at every boundary, so a turn that has
//     been changing things has already been taken down that road. A turn with no
//     counter at all answers NO: a session that never ran an episode cannot prove
//     it left the disk alone, and a doubt is not a proof.
//   - NOTHING OF THIS CONVERSATION'S OWN IS MIXED INTO IT. Where the custody
//     reduction took parts out of the drawing ([checkpointRead.ownRemainder]) or
//     had a ledger to take them against ([checkpointRead.held]), the full road's
//     two gates stand in front of the handover (checkpoint_custody.go). This road
//     has no ladder for those gates to read, so it declines the shape outright
//     and leaves the turn to the road that can weigh it.
//   - AND THERE IS A SENTENCE TO GIVE IT. The line is the person's own words and
//     nobody here writes them; a node started on an empty line is a worker
//     started on a blank page, which is the ending the full road spells
//     [checkpointCeilingNoBrief].
