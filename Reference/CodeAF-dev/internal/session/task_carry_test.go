// WHAT THE PRODUCTION CONSTRUCTOR CARRIES DOWN, PROVED THROUGH THE PRODUCTION
// CONSTRUCTOR.
//
// docs/TRAJECTORIES.md's C1 was one missing field in a literal that copies about
// thirty, and the reason eighteen tests missed it was that every one of them
// hand-built the worker's Config. So nothing in this file writes a Config
// literal for a worker: each test asks [Agent.newTaskAgent] for one, exactly as
// [Agent.workTaskNode] does, and asks the worker what it actually has.
//
// It covers the second level as well as the first, because that is where the
// remaining gaps lived: a PART's owner is not the conversation, it is its
// parent's worker, and anything a worker did not carry is something a part is
// built without.

// the person's client. [Agent.newTaskAgent] hands that client down, and this

// wrote the node off as having "the zero routing strategy" — which would have
// been true if a node built its own connection, and is why nobody may make it
