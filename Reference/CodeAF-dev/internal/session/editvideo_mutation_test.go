// EDIT_VIDEO IS A WRITE, AND EVERYTHING THAT WATCHES WRITES HAS TO KNOW IT.
//
// The verb arrived on the belt as a media hand and was read as one: [savingTools]
// knew it saved something, and nothing that resolves a PATH knew anything about
// it at all. So the citizens that stand between a model and a file it must not
// touch — the write scope (orchestrate.go), the tree claim (treehold.go) and the
// task's ground (taskoutside.go) — never saw an edit_video call, and neither did
// the ledger a revert is offered from. A node scoped to `assets/` could join two
// clips straight over `src/release.mp4`, and the harness would have watched it
// happen and then had nothing to put back.
//
// These hold the seam shut at both ends: the guard refuses the cut it should
// refuse, and the ledger can undo the cut that was allowed.
