// The subject is a handoff between two packages and four racing endings, so
// every case here runs a REAL process against a REAL timer — a fake clock would
// test the fake, and the thing that used to be broken was the ordering, not the
// arithmetic. The timers are the smallest ones the law allows a caller to spell,
// and every wait is a polled condition with a deadline (jobs_test.go's
// [waitFor]) rather than a sleep long enough to be reliable on a loaded machine.
