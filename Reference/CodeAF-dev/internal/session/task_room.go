// The room: a task node as a PLACE the person can enter.
//
// Everything else in this slice treats a node as a thing that is handed off and
// reported on — the proposal, the countdown, the worktree, the report that
// arrives minutes later (task.go, task_run.go). That is the right shape for
// work you delegate and stop thinking about, and it is the wrong shape for the
// moment a person changes their mind: the node is running, they can see it is
// going the wrong way, and until now the only thing they could do about it was
// kill it and propose the corrected task again.
//
// A room is four doors on one running node, and no more:
//
//   - [Agent.WatchTask] — the LIVE stream of the child agent's own events, as
//     they happen: its deltas, its tool calls beginning and ending, its errors.
//   - [Agent.SteerTask] — the person's words into the child's steering lane,
//     the same lane a background job's exit note rides (agent.go).
//   - [Agent.RetargetTask] — the person's EXPLICIT pick of another model for
//     this node, from its next request on.
//   - [Agent.TaskJournal] — the path to the node's whole transcript on disk.
//
// ── LIVE AND HISTORY ARE TWO LANES, FOR DECISION 19's OWN REASON ──
//
// The journal is the node's history and the room's stream is its present, and
// they are deliberately not the same door. A watcher subscribing to a running
// node gets what happens FROM NOW — no history is replayed, exactly as
// [eventHub.subscribe] replays none, because a stream that re-narrated a
// half-hour of somebody else's greps before reaching the live edge would make
// "watch this node" mean "read this node's history slowly". A person who wants
// the history opens the journal, which is a real session file and has been
// since the first node ran. It is the same split as the two update lanes: the
// turn's hub carries what is happening, [Agent.TaskUpdates] carries what
// landed, and neither is asked to be the other.
//
// WITH ONE SEAM BETWEEN THEM, AND IT IS NOT HISTORY. A message is journaled
// when it COMPLETES (agent.go's recordLocked), so the step the node is in the
// middle of is in neither lane: not on disk, because it has not finished, and
// not on the wire, because it happened before the person arrived. A watcher is
// therefore handed that one step on joining and nothing else — see
// [taskCatchup], which states exactly where the line is drawn.
//
// ── AND THIS STEER IS NOT THE CONVERSATION'S OWN ──
//
// There are two things in this package called steering and they are two acts,
// so read the one you meant. THIS file's steer is aimed at A NODE: another
// agent, in another worktree, with a transcript of its own, and the person's
// line arrives on that agent's steering queue and is drained at ITS next step
// boundary. What it promises is that the words are KEPT while the node is still
// running: "it arrived", "it arrived and the node is parked on its own pieces",
// or "there was nobody inside to read it and it is on the task's record"
// ([SteerReceipt]). A node that has FINISHED is a refusal and never a queue
// ([taskRoom.handIn] answers nobody), which is the one outcome that is not a
// receipt.
//
// [Agent.Steer] (steer.go) is the other one: a sentence SPLICED INTO THIS
// CONVERSATION'S RUNNING TURN, part of the question already being worked on. It
// carries an identity, three events, and a record that says whether the model
// actually read it or whether the turn ended first.
//
// They share the mechanism deliberately — one steering lane, drained at a step
// boundary, because that is the only legal place for a user message mid-turn —
// and they keep separate marks on [userMessage] (`steered` here, `steer` there)
// so that neither has to promise the other's outcome. steer.go states the split
// in full; nothing in this file reads that mark and nothing there reads this one.
//
// ── AND STEERING IS NOT ITSELF A REDIRECT ──
//
// Nothing in this file writes the goal. A steer is a line of TALK to the worker
// — "the config lives under etc/, not conf/" — arriving in the transcript as the
// person's own user-role message, which is exactly what it looks like from the
// child's side, and almost all of them stay talk.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE DOES IS RECORD WHO SAID IT. Every line said into a room is
// written onto the node as a DIRECTION with an id and a speaker (assignment.go),
// and one of those — the person's own, cited by the worker in an explicit call —
// can move what the work is judged by. The admitted `spec.brief` and
// `spec.acceptance` still never change; a revision is an overlay on them, at a
// version, carrying the person's verbatim words to whoever checks the work. The
// alternative was the contradiction this slice was written for: a worker told to
// follow the person's correction and then graded, by a checker reading the
// frozen text, for having followed it.
//
// A LINE FROM ANOTHER AGENT IS RECORDED THE SAME WAY AND MAY NOT DO THAT. The
// mechanics are one thing and authority is another, and only the person's own
// direction can move the target.
//
// ── THE ONE FIELD A ROOM DOES MOVE, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE SAME HOLE ──
//
// [Agent.RetargetTask] writes `spec.model`, and nothing else in the spec is
// writable from anywhere. The freeze it relaxes was never a freeze against the
// PERSON: it is a freeze against IMPLICIT DRIFT — a `/model` in the
// conversation silently moving work that was handed over before the switch,
// which is what task_person.go's StartTask exists to stop. An explicit pick
// made while standing in this node's room is the opposite of drift. It names
// one node, it is made by the person looking at that node's own page, and
// nothing else in the session moves with it.
//
// WHAT IS STILL FROZEN IS THE GOAL. `spec.brief` and `spec.acceptance` are what
// the work is graded against, so moving them mid-run would verify nothing;
// which model does the work is not part of that contract, any more than which
// model answered a turn is part of what a person asked for.

// or a node that is not running is an error naming which.
//
// The note carries NO DECORATION. A job's exit is framed ("task 3 finished: …")
// because the model has to be told what kind of news it is; a person's line
// needs no frame, because from the child's side it is what it looks like — the
// person talking. Wrapping it would teach the node to read the person's words
// as a system event, which is the one thing they are not.
//
// THE RECEIPT THE ENGINE ADDS IS A SECOND MESSAGE AND NEVER A WRAPPER, for
// exactly that reason: the id a revision has to cite is a fact about the
// delivery rather than part of what was said, so it is said separately, in the
// engine's own voice ([taskRoom.steerIn]).
//
// ── AND A NODE THAT IS WAITING ON ITS OWN PIECES STILL HEARS IT ──
//
// The first answer is whether the node was WAITING when the line was taken: it
// has handed part of its work out, said everything it had to say, and parked on
// the reports (task_run.go's [TaskGraph.park]). Nothing about it looks different
// from outside — a parked node is a RUNNING node — but for the person it is the
// difference between an answer in a few seconds and one that reads as silence,
// so the surfaces say which it was in their own words rather than promising the
// same thing about two different waits.
//
// It is a fact and not a refusal, because the line does arrive: the parked
// runner is released by the enqueue below, wakes with the sentence on its queue
// and re-enters the model with it ([taskRoom.steerIn], [runTaskChild]).
// Before that it went onto a queue with nothing to drain it — held for as long
// as the slowest piece ran and dropped outright if the last report arrived
// first, while the room said it had arrived.
//
// A LINE NOBODY CAN READ ANY MORE IS A REFUSAL AND NEVER A DROP. A node whose
// worker closed in the instant between the state check and the enqueue — the
// last piece reported, the parent folded, the agent shut — cannot be talked to,
// and the person is told so in the same breath as every other "there is nobody
// in there".
//
// ── AND A LINE THE CHECK CANNOT BE SHOWN IS HELD, NOT REFUSED ──
//
// While the gate is reading the work there is nobody inside the node, and until
// this returned a receipt that was the end of the story: the person was refused
// and their words stayed in their own box. A correction sent in that window is
// exactly the one that matters — the work is about to land — so it is TAKEN and
// written onto the node's own record instead ([TaskNode.heardDirection]), and
// the landing revalidates against it before anything is published
// (assignment.go, task_ledger.go). [SteerReceipt.Held] is how a surface tells
// that apart from delivery, in the engine's own words.

// line or refuses it, and both of those are answers; the uncertainty belongs to
// the wire, so internal/remote wraps a call it got no answer to with this and a
// surface matches it with errors.Is. It lives here because it is the vocabulary
// a surface reads a send's outcome in, beside [ErrNobodyToRead], and because
// internal/tui3 speaks this package and not that one.
//
// A SURFACE MAY NOT DRAW THIS AS A FAILURE. The one honest reading is "we do not

// the way back, because the link died, the deadline ran out, or the window was
// closed and reopened. The surface then holds a sentence it cannot say arrived
// and cannot say did not, and both of the things it can do are wrong: send it
// again and the worker reads one correction twice, drop it and the person's

// taskCatchup is the one thing neither of the room's two lanes can carry: the
// step the node is IN THE MIDDLE OF.
//
// A message reaches the journal when it COMPLETES (agent.go's recordLocked), and
// the live lane carries what happens from the instant somebody subscribes. So a
// person who walks into a node while it is thinking through a long answer used
// to be shown the last thing that FINISHED and nothing else — a page that sits
// still until the next delta lands, which reads either as a task that has frozen
// or as a task whose work is not being displayed at all. The reasoning is worse
// than absent: it is never journaled anywhere, so before this it existed only
// for whoever happened to be subscribed while it streamed.
//
// So the room keeps that step and [taskRoom.join] hands it over once, before the
// live events. It is a CATCH-UP AND NOT A REPLAY: everything the journal already
// holds is deliberately missing from it, because the surface reads the history
// off the file and drawing the same paragraph from both lanes is worse than
// drawing it from neither.
//
// ── WHERE THE LINE IS DRAWN, AND WHY IT IS DRAWN THERE ──
//
// The boundary is loop.go's own, not a guess about it. A response is recorded
// the moment it completes: with no tool calls it is recorded before
// EventAssistantDone, and with tool calls it is recorded BEFORE the batch runs.
// EventAssistantDone and EventToolBegin are therefore each the first event after
// a journal write, and both clear everything kept here — what they closed is on
// disk now. EventTurnDone remains a final guard for turns that ended elsewhere.
//
// It is the same fact that keeps a BEGUN call out of the catch-up. The assistant
// message naming it was written before it started, so the journal has the call
// already; what the file cannot say is that it has not come back, and a surface
// reads that off the missing tool result rather than off an event (internal/tui3
// ReadTranscript). An ANNOUNCED call is the other half of that: the model has
// finished spelling it out and the batch has not started, so nothing has been
// written yet and the announcement is carried.
