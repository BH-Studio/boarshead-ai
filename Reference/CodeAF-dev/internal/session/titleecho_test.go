package session

// A NAMER THAT HANDS BACK ITS OWN INSTRUCTION HAS NOT NAMED ANYTHING.
//
// A real session on this machine was called "name this session in ≤8 words,
// lowercase, no quotes" — the instruction, echoed by one of the cheap models
// the auxiliary calls land on, accepted by a cleaner that only trimmed, and
// then drawn title-cased across home. These tests pin the three answers to it:
// the echo is refused at the moment a name is minted, a name already written
// down under one is read as no name, and an unnamed session is not a blank row
// — the person's own opening words stand in until a later turn names it.
