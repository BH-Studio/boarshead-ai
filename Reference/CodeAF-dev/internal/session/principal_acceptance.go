package session

// THE SESSION'S ACCEPTANCE: what the WHOLE ask has to satisfy.
//
// Every acceptance in this build until now has been one unit of work's. The
// judge writes one when it starts a task (route_judge.go's [routeAcceptance]),
// the shaper writes one for a proposal, and that node's auditor is the only
// thing that ever reads it. NOTHING HELD THE WHOLE ASK. A session could land
// four units of work, every one of them verified against its own sentence, and
// there was no sentence anywhere that said whether the thing the person
// actually asked for had happened.
//
// For an attended session that is right: the person is holding it. For an
// unattended one it is the missing half of the whole feature — a [Steward] that
// carries work on has to be carrying it on TOWARDS something, and a goal owner
// with no acceptance is a goal owner whose only reading of "finished" is the
// running model's own opinion of itself.
//
// ── IT IS THE JUDGE'S OWN MACHINERY, NOT A SECOND ONE ───────────────────────
//
// [routeAcceptance]'s lower rung frames the person's own words as the whole
// done-condition. No model rewrites a concrete request before the working model
// sees it. This keeps writing, data and code requests equally direct, and takes
// one synchronous call off the front of every unattended run.
//
// ── AND IT IS FROZEN ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// [Steward.setAcceptance] writes once and refuses every write after it. A
// done-condition the running model can edit is a done-condition the model
// grades itself against, which is the exact reading the checkpoint road was
// rebuilt to stop relying on. Only a person changes it, and the way they change
// it is by asking for something else.

import (

// sessionAcceptanceBrief asks for the done-condition of a whole ask.
//
// IT SHARES THE WIRE AND NOT THE QUESTION. [routeVerdictContract] is appended
// verbatim so the fields, their bounds and what each is FOR are one sentence in
// this package rather than two — the drift that ends with one door writing an
// acceptance nobody can check is exactly what that const exists to prevent. The
// `work` field is answered true here by construction: somebody has already
// asked for this and it is already being done. This late reading supplies only
// a destination; it cannot add commands after the baseline was taken.
const sessionAcceptanceBrief = `You are given ONE ask, in the person's own words, after finished work was retained outside the requested workspace.

Read only the requested final destination. Declare delivery: {"kind":"workspace|branch|report", "quote":"<verbatim words from the person's ask>"}. Use workspace when changed files must reach the person's requested working copy or when uncertain. Use branch only when the person explicitly wants a retained branch as the final result without integration. Use report only when the requested final result is the answer/report itself, not implementation elsewhere. For branch/report quote the original words establishing that destination, including any constraint about integration. Do not choose branch merely because workers use worktrees, and do not convert an implementation request into a report about implementation.

Answer {"work": true, "goal": "<the ask, self-contained>", "acceptance": "delivery matches the original request", "checks": [], "delivery": {"kind":"workspace", "quote":""}, "why": "<one line>"}. Do not declare commands.
