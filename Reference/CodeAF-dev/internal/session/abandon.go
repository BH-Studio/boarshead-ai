// THE SECOND STAGE OF A STOP, AND WHY IT HAD TO BE BUILT FROM THE BOTTOM UP.
//
// A person presses esc and the turn's context is cut. That is the FIRST stage
// and it is enough almost always: the provider request is aborted by the
// transport, a tool that reads its context returns, and the loop closes the
// turn's hub three or four seconds later. What it is not enough for is a wait
// that never looks at a context at all, and this package used to contain
// several — the tool batch's own `wg.Wait()`, the jobs registry's SIGTERM and
// SIGKILL graces, a `cmd.Wait` parked on a pipe a grandchild had escaped with.
// A turn parked on any of them left the surface saying `stopping` for as long
// as the wait lasted, which on the measured run in issue #265 was four minutes,
// after which the only key left was the one that takes the whole process and
// every other conversation in it.
//
// So there is a bound now, and behind the bound there is a door. [Agent.Abandon]
// is that door. It does four things and each of them is load-bearing:
//
//   - it CLOSES THE ABANDON SIGNAL, which is what ends the waits that a context
//     could not reach ([abandonOf], loop.go's [waitBatch], jobs.go's
//     [waitDoneUnder]);
//   - it CANCELS THE TURN AGAIN, which aborts whatever HTTP is still in flight —
//     every provider request is built with the turn's context on it
//     (internal/provider's client.go), so the socket is closed by the transport
//     and the reader parked inside Read is released;
//   - it DISOWNS THE TURN, so the session is free the instant this returns and
//     the very next thing a person types opens a turn of its own;
//   - and it WRITES ONE LINE saying so, with what the turn had spent by then.
//
// THE LINE IS THE ACCEPTANCE AND NOT THE DECORATION. A turn that is let go of
// while it may still be spending is a turn nobody could otherwise account for:
// the seal that carries a turn's cost is written when a turn ENDS, and the whole
// definition of an abandoned turn is that nobody waited for its end. The money
// itself already reaches the machine's ledger per call rather than per turn
// (usage_ledger.go, issue #269), so the bill is not lost — what was lost was any
// record that a turn had been let go of at all.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO is claim the goroutine is gone. It may not be: the whole
// reason the door exists is that some waits cannot be ended from outside. What
// it guarantees is that nothing is WAITING for it — not the surface, not the
// session, not the person — and that the file says so.

// abandonKey is the turn context's carrier for the abandon signal. It is a
// context value rather than a field read off the agent because the waits that
// need it are several call frames down inside tools that hold no reference to
// the agent, and threading one parameter through every one of them would be a
// parameter that the next wait forgets to take.

//
// NIL IS THE ORDINARY ANSWER OUTSIDE A TURN and every caller has to read it as
// "this wait has no second stage", not as an error: a completion driven with no
// turn around it, a tool called from a test, and every task node's own context
// all arrive here without one. A nil channel in a select blocks forever, which
// is exactly the right behaviour — the arm is simply never taken.

// a second call — a duplicated deadline, a surface asking twice — writes no
// second line and disturbs nothing.
//
// THE SESSION IS FREE WHEN THIS RETURNS. running is cleared, the queues are
// dropped and the turn's channels are let go of under the same lock, so a Submit
// arriving on the next keystroke opens an ordinary turn and cannot be refused
// for a turn nobody is waiting for.
