// THE REPLY A PERSON STOPS IS JUDGED THE WAY A REPLY THE GUARD STOPS IS.
//
// On 2026-09-01 a serving endpoint looped the model's own `</think>` into the
// answer, the person watched fourteen seconds of it and pressed esc, and the
// whole run was kept as their assistant's reply — in the transcript, in the
// journal, and in every request after. These pin the other outcome: soup that
// was stopped by hand is not kept, the person is told in the guard's own
// words, and a stopped reply that was still language is kept exactly as
// before (TestInterruptKeepsPartialReply is that half).

// soupStep streams three kilobytes of one token and then waits to be stopped.
