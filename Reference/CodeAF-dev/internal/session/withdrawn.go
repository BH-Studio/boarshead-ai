// Withdrawal: what a call to a hand the HARNESS TOOK AWAY is answered with, and
// how a step the harness itself failed is told apart from a step the model got
// wrong.
//
// ── THE MEASURED FAILURE ──
//
// SWE-Marathon s4, task 1, 00:37Z–00:40Z. A worker building a Java language
// server in Rust had been editing, building and testing for half an hour. Then:
// one edit that replaced text with itself ("No changes made … the replacement
// produced identical content"), four greps with a malformed pattern, each
// answered "No matches found". Five steps that taught nothing, and the
// no-progress ratchet fired ([taskLimits.noProgress], task_run.go): LAND NOW,
// and the belt was narrowed to the hands that save a file ([landingBelt]).
//
// What the model was told about that narrowing, by the harness, eight times,
// was eighteen bytes:
//
//	Unknown tool: read
//	Unknown tool: bash
//
// "Unknown" is a sentence about the MODEL — you named a verb nobody has. It was
// a lie: the harness had the tool a second earlier and took it. It names no
// reason, no surviving set, and nothing to do instead, so the only rational
// move left is to try again — the call was legal thirty seconds ago and nothing
// said otherwise. The model retried `read` twice, the same grep three times,
// the same `cargo build` three times. The stuck watch (looped.go) then injected
// three [stuck] notes scolding it for the repetition the harness had just
// manufactured. At 00:40:22 the model worked it out for itself, from nothing
// but the shape of the failures: "I can't build or run tests — bash is not in
// my tool list … No bash, no read, no grep, no find."
//
// Meanwhile it had saved real edits to parser.rs and analysis.rs at 00:39:50
// and 00:40:02 — after the build hand was gone. The task landed with those
// edits NEVER COMPILED, reported as work, and the chat had to discover and
// build them five minutes later.
//
// ── THE LAW ──
//
// A capability the harness WITHDRAWS is reported as a withdrawal, never as an
// unknown verb. The result says WHY it is gone, WHAT REMAINS by name, and WHAT
// TO DO with what remains. A name nobody ever had is still "Unknown tool" —
// that one really is a sentence about the model, and the two must not be told
// with the same words (loop.go's [Agent.executeTool]).
//
// And a step whose failure the harness produced is the HARNESS'S step, not the
// model's: it never advances a stuck counter and never feeds the loop watch
// ([toolResult.harness] — set once at the chokepoint, carried out to the
// runner on [Event.HarnessMade]).
