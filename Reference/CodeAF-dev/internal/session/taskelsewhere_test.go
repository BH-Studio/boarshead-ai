// it. These are the whole of what one window is allowed to say about the others:
// what they have out right now, and whether a row of the shared index that says
// `running` is a claim anybody is still standing behind.

// writeWindow puts one window's presence on disk, exactly as a live session's
// heartbeat writes it, and names it in meta.json the way a session that settled
// on a title does. age is how long ago the window last said anything.
