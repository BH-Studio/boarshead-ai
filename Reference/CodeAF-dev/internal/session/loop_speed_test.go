// THE LAW IN loop.go's HEADER, AS A TEST THAT FAILS THE BUILD.
//
// "The only wait a person experiences is the main model generating." Every
// reading this harness makes on its own behalf — the recall that picks which
// remembered lines a message needs, the judge that asks whether it was work, the
// reader that sketches what is left of a long answer, the namer, the narrator —
// runs BESIDE the work and may only interrupt it.
//
// THIS FILE IS THE GATE THAT CATCHES THE NEXT SERIAL CALL WHOEVER ADDS IT. Every
// reading is made three seconds slow and the two figures the law is about are
// asserted in milliseconds. A turn that awaits any one of them cannot pass.
//
// AND THE QUALITY HALF IS ASSERTED BESIDE IT, because taking a wait off a path is
// easy and keeping the answer is the hard part: a reading that lands before the
// first word is applied to THIS request, one that lands after it is applied to
// the next step, and neither is dropped.

// paceLawBudget is the whole of loop.go's law in one figure: how long a person
// may wait to be sent ANYWHERE, and how long a tool result may sit before the
// next request leaves.
//
// IT IS NOT A LATENCY TARGET AND IT IS NOT A NUMBER SOMEBODY LIKED. It separates
// two populations that are three orders of magnitude apart — assembling messages
// in memory, which is what a turn really does between those two moments, and one
// model call, which is what used to happen there — so any figure inside that gap
// is the same test. This one is derived from the figure the build already holds
// about people: a twentieth of [lanes.SpokenWithin], which is one second, the
// limit of a person's uninterrupted flow of thought (Miller 1968 through Nielsen
// 1993) and the point past which this build owes them a word about a wait. A
