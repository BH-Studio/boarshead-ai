// resume_test.go is the law over resume.go: a question that was never answered
// is asked again by the window that took the conversation, ONCE, and only when
// the journal really ends in the shape that says nothing was answered.
//
// The replication is #760's own: a turn that is THINKING — hidden deltas,
// nothing on the screen, nothing to keep as a partial — ended by another window
// taking the conversation over. It is run end to end, through two agents on one
// file, because the whole point of the design is that nothing passes between
// the two windows except that file.
