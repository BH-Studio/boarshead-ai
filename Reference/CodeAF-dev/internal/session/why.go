// Why answers "what did you just change, and why" from the journal alone.
//
// No model is asked. The answer is a derivation over the last turn's messages:
// the instruction the person gave, then every tool call that turn made, each
// read back as the thing it did — "edited loop.go (+32 −2 via 2 replacements),
// ran go build ./… (ok), wrote out.txt". Deterministic, offline, and free, so a
// surface can bind it to a key and get the same sentence every time.
//
// That is a deliberate refusal of the obvious implementation. Asking the model
// to explain itself costs a request, takes seconds, and returns a plausible
// account of what it MEANT to do — which is exactly the thing a person reaches
// for this to check. The journal knows what actually ran; the model knows what
// it was going for. The "why" here is the person's own instruction, quoted, and
// the "what" is the record. Nothing in between is invented.
//
// The whyLimit caps how much of the instruction is quoted: this is a reminder of
// what was asked, not a re-print of the message.

// whyCommandLimit bounds one shell command in the answer. A command longer than
