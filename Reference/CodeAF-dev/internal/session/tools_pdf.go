// read, wrapped: the file tool grows a SENSE rather than the belt growing a
// tool.
//
// A person drops a PDF into the conversation and says "what does section 4
// say". Every belt that answers this by adding an extract_pdf tool has made the
// model choose between two hands for one intention — and models choose wrong,
// reliably: what actually happens is `bash: python3 -c "import PyPDF2..."`, on a
// machine where PyPDF2 is not installed, twice, before the model gives up and
// asks the person to paste the text. The failure is not that the model is
// stupid. It is that read said it reads files and then did not read this file.
//
// So the fix goes inside read. The tool keeps its name, its schema, its
// description, its truncation law, and its place in the model's habits, and it
// learns that a PDF is a file whose text lives one decode deeper than the
// bytes. Nothing new to discover, nothing new to choose between, and the
// prompt line that goes with it (system.md) is one clause, not a paragraph
// teaching a new tool.
//
// This is backgroundBash's shape exactly (tools_jobs.go): find pi's tool in the
// belt, wrap it, hand every call it does not claim to the inner tool verbatim.
//
// THE WRAPPER ITSELF NOW LIVES IN tools_sense.go, because the argument above
// generalized. A PDF was the first file whose meaning lived one decode deeper
// than its bytes; a photograph, a recording and a film are the next three, and
// four wrappers chained around one tool would each parse the same arguments,
// resolve the same path, and let their ORDER silently decide which sense claims
// a file two of them could read. So one wrapper sniffs once and routes, and
// this file keeps what is genuinely its own: the local, free, in-binary rung,
// and pi's truncation law that every other rung borrows.
//
// THE ANSWER OBEYS PI'S TRUNCATION LAW, not a second one. Extracted text is
// text, a 400-page manual is a large file, and a model that learned from read's
// description how far one read goes and how to page past it gets exactly that
// here, footer wording included — the offset it is told to use works, because
// the next call re-extracts and pages from the same text. bare's truncation
// helpers are unexported, so this file MIRRORS them and says so; the SENTENCES
// are pinned to bare's read tool and the NUMBERS are no longer copied at all —
// the caps arrive as [bare.Caps] from the same belt the inner read was built
// with, so a smaller window cuts an extracted PDF exactly where it cuts a file.
