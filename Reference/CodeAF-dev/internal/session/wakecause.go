// wakecause.go answers ONE question for the end of a turn: which request is this
// turn's ending judged against?
//
// ── THE MEASURED FAILURE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A conversation delegated a build and was asked, while it ran, for a checksum
// word reversed. It answered that (journal line 35), the task landed later, and
// the landing woke a turn that reported the marker (line 43). The end-of-turn
// reader was then shown THE LAST THING THE PERSON HAD TYPED as the ask — the
// checksum question, answered a turn earlier and therefore nowhere in this
// turn's digest — and said "the reversed checksum word has not been given"
// (line 46). The turn was carried on and the same word was repeated (line 56).
//
// ── THE RULE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A turn owes what arrived in it: the person's own message when they opened or
// steered it, and the TARGET of every result it carries. Both ride provenance
// that already exists — a landing note carries [TaskReplyTag], a batch keeps one
// tag per task ([batchSessionNotes]) — so the ask is read from the turn's own
// arrivals rather than from whatever was typed most recently.
//
// A RESULT'S TARGET IS WHAT ITS OWN WORK WAS FOR AT THE END, which is the
// admitted request on the nearly all tasks nobody redirects, and the effective
// one where the person moved that task's goal in its room while it ran
// ([TaskReplyTag.Obligation], composed from the assignment's snapshot by
// [TaskNode.resultTagLocked]). It is never the whole conversation's newest
// instruction: a slow task is not an authority on what has been asked since, and
// [owedAsk] keeps the source of every line for exactly that reason.
//
// Nothing here reads outcome text and nothing asks a model. A failed task's tag
// is a tag like any other, so remediation is still judged against what that task
// was for.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT CHANGE: the gating. A woken turn is still read, still priced
// as a wake, and still carried on when the reader says ITS request is unfinished.

// asked for. Collapsing the two into a bare list is how a slow task would look
