	// aside is the escape hatch from the queue, and it exists because A SCRIPTED
	// COMPLETER ANSWERS A CONCURRENT ERRAND BY THE SHAPE OF ITS REQUEST, NEVER BY
	// ITS PLACE IN THE QUEUE. The steps above are one positional line: whoever
	// calls next takes the next step, whichever goroutine they are on. That is
	// exactly right for the turn, which makes its calls one after another, and
	// exactly wrong for the errands this session runs beside a turn — a namer, a
	// title, a memory pass — which are started on goroutines nothing orders
	// against the turn.
	//
	// The incident was #392. #333 made the two roads that start work nobody typed
	// ask for the name the moment they decide to, ahead of the node
	// (taskname.go's [nameAhead]) — so the namer's call now lands in the middle
	// of a scripted handover. Landing on the slot holding the final answer, the
	// turn ran off the end of the script and ended on "(unscripted)"; landing on
	// a grinding step, the namer was answered with that round's tool call and the
	// task was announced under the trimmed wreckage of it. Both about one run in
	// five, and neither a fact about the code under test.
	//
	// An aside that answers returns its own response and spends NO step, so the
	// script the test wrote still reaches the turn in the order the test wrote
	// it. taskname_test.go met this race first and routes by shape with

	// on — and a request answered here is one they can no longer see. They opt in
	// with [answerTheReadingsOffTheQueue] instead.

	// beside the first scripted step of every fixture whose config names a
