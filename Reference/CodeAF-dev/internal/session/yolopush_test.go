// THE ROAD A CHAT DOOR'S OWN BASH PUSH TOOK.
//
// An unattended `codeaf chat --yolo` run hosted a /task in a clone checked out
// on a local branch named `santos/dev` — the same name as the shared remote
// branch. The task itself was refused its push by the git guard's task register
// (taskgit.go, "git push is not yours to run"), read the refusal, and stopped.
// The DOOR hosting it then ran, as its own bash calls, the three lines this
// test replays — the last two of which landed two commits on the shared remote
// branch, with no pull request and nobody's word but its own.
//
// The brief this test was written from says what should hold: a --yolo run
// does not push to a branch it did not create. The nearest thing a test can
// reach without a live remote is the CONSENT DECISION that let the command
// run: the pre-action chain every bash call passes through (loop.go's
// ep.preAction), whose first citizen is the approval gate and whose last is
// the git guard. This test sends the three lines that really ran down that
// chain and asserts the refusal.
//
// WHAT THIS TEST CANNOT COVER, and does not pretend to:
//
//   - A live remote. The push never runs here; the test pins the decision
//     that stood in front of it, not the push itself.
//   - The resident's CONSEQUENCE classifier (internal/head/head.go:1123's
//     consequenceGated, consulted from that head's own tool road at
//     internal/head/bash.go:214) — the v1 resident's road, a different product.
//     internal/session imports internal/head in no non-test file, so it never
//     sees a chat door's tool call. The chat road's only verb reading is the
//     guard's own firstBranchMover (taskgit.go), which reads push/merge/rebase
//     and nothing about consequence; this fix does not wire that head up.
//   - The git guard's principal gate (taskgit.go's whoseCopy) still leaves a
//     [Person]-headed session unguarded ON PURPOSE — taskgit_test.go's own rows
//     assert that. The fix is the NARROWER third register beside it
//     (taskgit.go's refusedUnattendedBranchMovement): an unattended run
//     standing on a branch it did not create may not push, merge or rebase it.
//     This test now reaches that register, because the session in it carries
//     the --yolo fact (Config.Unattended) and stands on a branch it did not
//     cut.
//
// THE FIX IS IN taskgit.go. The first draft of the test was written to fail
// before it existed; it now passes against the register that closes the road.
