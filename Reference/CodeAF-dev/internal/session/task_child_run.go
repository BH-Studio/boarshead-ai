// task_child_run.go is ONE NODE'S RUN, from the first request to the last report
// folded in.
//
// ── WHY IT IS A VALUE AND NOT A FUNCTION ──
//
// The run has fourteen facts that every phase of it reads and most of them
// write: what the node has changed, how many steps it has spent, how many of
// them added nothing, when its clock runs out, how many extensions it has been
// granted, what it has been seen to run. They used to live as locals in one
// five-hundred-line function with two closures over them, which is the same
// state with the same sharing and no name for any of the phases that touch it —
// so nothing could be read, tested or reasoned about on its own, and the four
// defects filed off the family audit were all one road with too many endings for
// anybody to hold in their head (#260).
//
// [childRun] is that state, named once, with the phases as methods on it. The
// sharing is EXACTLY what the closures had — a pointer receiver is what a
// closure over a local variable already was — so nothing about when a fact is
// written or read has moved. What is new is only that each phase can be pointed
// at.
//
// ── THE PHASES, IN THE ORDER THEY HAPPEN ──
//
//   - [childRun.open] submits the brief, or queues it for a node whose parts are
//     already out.
//   - [childRun.drain] consumes the node's own events, and [childRun.step] reads
//     one finished tool call: what it produced, whether it added anything,
//     whether the node is spinning.
//   - [childRun.checkpoint] is the WORKING or CIRCLING question, put to a reader
//     when a threshold fires.
//   - [childRun.landIfStopped] is the landing turn a stopped node is given.
//   - [childRun.foldParts] holds a node open while its parts run, and folds
//     their reports.

// childRun is everything one node's run knows about itself while it is running.
//
// The two contexts are NOT interchangeable and both are kept. `ctx` is the
// node's own, and it is what the progress reader and the landing turn are given
// so that tripping a threshold does not cancel the very turn that asks whether
// the work should carry on. `runCtx` is this run's, hung off `ctx` with a cancel
// of its own, and it is what the working turns ride — so [childRun.stop] ends
// the child the way `jobs kill` does, a cancelled turn with its partial work
// kept and its branch intact, while the caller is told WHICH threshold fired
// rather than being left to infer it from a context error that has three
// possible causes.

// writing, ending in the no-progress counter killing the one node that could
// have folded them together.
//
// SO THE BRIEF IS QUEUED RATHER THAN ASKED. It sits on the steering queue with
// nobody having read it, [childRun.foldParts] parks, and the turn that reads it
// is the turn the last report starts — one request holding the brief, the

// ([drawnDivision.afterParts]) and every part's news at once, which is the

//
// EVERY OTHER NODE OPENS EXACTLY AS IT ALWAYS DID. A node with no parts out —
// which is nearly all of them, including one that divides mid-run and is
// already talking when it does — submits its brief here and runs.

// door marks the node Interrupted and requeues it (task_store.go's interrupt),

// working in when the process died — [TaskNode.resumeTree] reuses that working
// copy on exactly this flag. The predecessor's effects are therefore
// unannounced facts about the disk: files it saved, edits it half-made, a build
// it left mid-run. miniplan checkpoints a trajectory and replays it; codeaf's
// recovery unit is the node and the tree is the record

//

// service call that saves a report, a harness that writes itself, a tool added
// next month — is still judged by the one thing that cannot be argued with,
// which is whether the tree moved. Without it a node whose whole job was
// producing files could be killed for having produced them with the wrong verb.
//
// ── IT USED TO RUN A `git status` FOR EVERY FINISHED CALL ──
//
// And every one of them read the same tree. A batch's end events all arrive
// together, after the whole batch has run (loop.go sends them after the batch's
// wait), so eight calls were eight processes answering one question, the first
// of which — in call order, even a `read` — was credited with whatever the
// batch had done. Ten to thirty milliseconds each on a small repository, seconds
// each on a large one, on the goroutine that publishes the node's room and has
// to reach the end of the stream before the node can finish.
//
// So the tree is read AT MOST ONCE A BATCH, at the first call of it that could
// have changed anything ([couldChangeTheTree]), and that call is the one that
// moved it; the rest of the batch reads the answer as spent. A batch made only
// of reading hands asks nothing at all, which is most of a node's exploring.
//
// AND A BATCH WHOSE ONLY CHANGE WAS A SAVE SPENDS ITS READING AT THE END OF
// ITSELF ([childRun.batchSettled]). A save that names its file is its own
// evidence and asks nothing, which would leave this fingerprint one batch behind
// the tree — and the next batch's first command would then be handed movement
// that was the save's. That reading takes no verdict; it only puts the
// fingerprint back on the tree, at the one moment in a run when the batch is
// over and the next request has not gone.
//
// AND THE READING IS TAKEN BESIDE THE RUNNER, NOT IN FRONT OF IT. It is an
// [offpath.Reading] — the one shape this build has for "a fact gathered in the
// background and read when it is wanted" (looped.go's stuck watch reads the
// same fingerprint through the same type) — settled with the same bound that
// watch uses, [lane.Hysteresis], the wait nobody can feel. On a repository git
