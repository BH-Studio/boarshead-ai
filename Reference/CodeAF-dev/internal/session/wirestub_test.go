// answersChatOnly is the guard every recording chat stub in this package runs
// first. A stub here stands in for one route, the chat completions POST, and
// since #373 a default router's lane beat asks its base for an endpoints page
// on the first refresh (agent.go's [Agent.startLaneBeat]) — so a default stub
// also receives `GET /models/<model>/endpoints`, and a stub that files that GET
// as a chat body records an empty request and hands the real turn the wrong
// script line. A connected direct service has no lane beat at all. This guard
// answers any unexpected non-chat request as a bare base does, with a plain
// 404, which the sheet reads as "no page here" and leaves alone
// (lanes.ErrNoSheetHere).
//
// It reports whether the request was the chat POST; the caller returns at once
// when it was not.
