// ── the vision fallback ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A person who attaches a photo to a model that cannot see it has not made a
// mistake. They have a picture and a question, and the surface has, quite often,
// a second model that can look at it. Refusing outright — the whole behaviour
// before this — made the person do the routing by hand: switch model, re-attach,
// ask again, switch back. The fallback does it for them, once, and says so.
//
// Three properties are the design:
//
//   - IT IS ONE SHOT, NOT A SESSION. The vision model is sent the picture and
//     the person's words and NOTHING ELSE — no system prompt, no transcript, no
//     tools. It is being asked what it can see, not being made a second agent
//     with a second memory of this conversation.
//
//   - THE TRANSCRIPT KEEPS TEXT, NOT PARTS. What goes into the conversation is
//     the person's words, a line naming the files, and the vision model's answer
//     as an ordinary assistant message. The image parts go to the vision model
//     and are never recorded, because the chat model is BLIND BY CONSTRUCTION:
//     leaving parts in the transcript would put an image_url in front of it on
//     every step of every turn after this one, which is the 400 this whole path
//     exists to avoid. The journal still writes the references (image.go's law),
//     so the file, its digest and its type are all on the record.
//
//   - IT IS SAID OUT LOUD. The reply is prefixed "[vision: <model>]". A second
//     model answering in the first one's voice, silently, would be the surface
//     lying about who is talking.

// visionSeer answers WHICH MODEL LOOKS, and it is the ONE answer the whole
// surface uses: this fallback, the view_image tool (tools_view.go) and
// read_document's image rung (tools_doc.go) all ask here, so "can I see" has a
// single answer wherever it is asked (docs/MULTIMODAL.md, Decision 8). It is ""
// when nothing on this machine can look at a picture.
//
// THE LOOKING SLOT IS THE FRONT DOOR. [Config.MediaModel] is the surface's own
// use-time resolver, and every rung behind it — the settings slot, the role
// pin, the best catalog candidate, the curated fallback — is capability-checked
// against the catalog before it answers, so a slug it names is a model that
// publishes image input. A resolver that answers "" has said there is none, and
// the roles ladder is deliberately NOT tried after it: the pin is a rung of that
// same ladder, and asking twice would resurrect the model the resolver just
// passed over for being unable to see.
//
// A NIL resolver is a surface built before the slot existed — a test, an old
// door — and it falls to roles.Resolve, which is exactly what this path did
// before. The floor is "" rather than the session's model on purpose:
// everywhere else roles.Resolve falls back to the model the person is already
// talking to, and here that is often the model just established as blind, so
// the ladder must be allowed to run out instead of returning it.
