// WHAT A PART IS TOLD, AND WHICH HALF OF IT A MODEL WROTE.
//
// A part is a worker that never sees the conversation its work came out of and
// cannot ask anybody anything. Its opening message is the whole of its world, and
// that world has always been assembled from two halves that are NOT the same kind
// of thing:
//
//   - THE FAMILY'S CONTEXT — the work being divided, and the map of who owns what
//     — which is identical for every part and is a FACT THE HARNESS ALREADY HOLDS.
//   - THE SCOPE — what this one part works on, the material it opens, what its
//     done-condition rests on — which only the worker holding the material can
//     write, and which is different for every part. What the part OWNS is its
//     done-condition and travels in the contract's own DONE WHEN section, which
//     is why this heading says WORKS ON (#281).
//
// THE TWO HALVES USED TO BE DECIDED BY THE ROAD RATHER THAN BY THE HALF. A part
// the harness drew out of a sketch got the parent's brief and its siblings
// composed around it (task_divide_sketch.go); a part a worker wrote with
// `divide_work` got the worker's prose and NOTHING ELSE, and the parent's brief
// reached it only if the cheapest model on the road remembered to restate it N
// times. Which means the weakest world was handed to the part on the road a cheap
// crew actually drives, and nothing downstream could see that it had happened —
// the reviewer may sharpen a brief, but it fails open, so a division admitted
// without a reading was admitted without context too.
//
// SO THE CONTEXT IS COMPOSED, ONCE, BY THIS FILE, AND BOTH ROADS COME THROUGH IT
// ([Agent.admitDivision] is the single call site, and the sketch road reaches it
// by putting its drawing to that same door). A worker writes a scope; the harness
// writes everything around it. Nothing is left to a model remembering to repeat
// itself, which is the same law the person's own words are carried under
// (task_brief.go): what the code already holds is never asked of a model.
//
// AND THE PERSON'S ASK IS NOT HERE, deliberately. It rides on every node's spec
// and [composeBrief] prints it above the work under the heading that says whose
// words they are, so a part gets it exactly once — putting it in the context
// block as well would print the same paragraph twice under two headings, which
// reads as two instructions that happen to agree.

import "strings"

// These three are the BOUNDARY, and it is stated in both directions because a
// part that does not know its siblings exist is a part that does all four jobs
// and collides with three workers doing the same.
//
// IT IS STATED BY THE HARNESS FOR EVERY PART, whoever wrote the parts. A worker
// writing its own division knows what it gave away and the schema asks it to say
// so — but knowing is not saying, and a part whose author forgot is a part that
// finds out by overwriting somebody's work. The settled parts list is what
// actually got handed out, so it is the honest answer to "who else is holding
// what", and it is the same answer on both roads.

// for all of them. The parent's brief is fitted to its room once here rather than
// once per part — a division into five parts fitting the same document five times
// is four passes over a page nobody changed.

	// ground is the work being divided, already fitted to the room a part's
	// brief leaves for it, or empty where there is nothing to carry.

	// were settled in.
	scopes []string

	// every part of the division. See [familyOf] for the arithmetic it comes out
	// of and what it guarantees.
	room int
}

// familyOf composes the context every part of one division is given.
//
// THE GROUND IS WHAT A PART INHERITS ([TaskGraph.inheritedLocked]): the brief the
// work was admitted with AND the reports of whatever ran before it, which is
// where a family's findings actually are. It stops short of the standing orders,
// which the frontier appends to every part in its own right — a part composed on
// the whole assembled brief would read the house rules twice.
//
// AND THE PERSON'S OWN WORDS COME OFF THE FRONT OF IT. Where somebody wrote the
// work themselves the brief opens on their sentence verbatim, and [composeBrief]
// is already printing that sentence above all of this under the heading that says
// whose it is. Printing it twice under two headings reads as two instructions
// that happen to agree.
//
// ── ONE BOUND, AND WHAT IT GUARANTEES ──
//
// A part's whole brief fits in [taskShapeBriefLimit], which is the bound every
// brief on this road is held to. The three sections are fitted in the order they
// may not be lost in, and the arithmetic is done ONCE, here, against the worst
// case any part of this division can present:
//
//  1. THE BOUNDARY IS NEVER CUT. Its widest form names every scope — one more
//     than any single part is given — and that width is taken off the top.
//  2. THE SCOPE IS NEVER CUT FOR THE GROUND. What is left after the boundary is
//     the scope's room, and the LONGEST scope in the division is reserved out of
//     it, so the fitting is the same for the first part and the fifth.
//  3. THE GROUND TAKES WHAT REMAINS. A part that lost the last page of what the
//     work already found out is worse off; a part that lost the sentence saying
//     what it owns, or the one saying what its siblings own, is dangerous.
//
// The ground is [TaskGraph.inheritedLocked]'s answer, which has already fitted
// the prerequisite reports and marked any cut with [clip]. This second fit
// must not stack a second mark on a cut that already carried one — [clip]
// moves a trailing mark rather than doubling it, so a report is marked once
// or not at all.
