package session

// THE ACCOUNTS THAT BRING THEIR OWN TOOLS.
//
// Mail and a calendar are hands this build wrote: five tools, five sentences,
// all of them in tools_connect.go where anybody can read them. A key account is
// the other extreme: one raw call, and the service's own documentation is the
// schema. This file is the third shape, and it is neither — the account is asked
// WHAT IT BRINGS, it answers with a list of tools and the shape of each one's
// arguments, and those become the belt.
//
// Nothing here knows the names in advance and nothing here may. The list is the
// service's, read live at the moment an account is picked up, and a service that
// serves five tools today and seven tomorrow is a service this build carries
// seven of tomorrow without a line changing. The seam is
// [connect.Manager.MCPTools] and [connect.Manager.MCPCall]; everything past it —
// which protocol, which endpoint, how a session with the provider is held open —
// is that package's business and never this one's.
//
// ── THE FOUR THINGS THAT ARE DECIDED HERE ──
//
//   - THE NAME. A served tool is armed as `<account>_<its own name>`, folded to
//     the casing a belt can carry. The service's name for it is kept beside the
//     belt's, because that is what a call has to be made with.
//   - THE RECORD. What the belt calls it, what the service calls it, whose
//     account it is, and WHICH CAPABILITY GOVERNS IT. That last one is the whole
//     reason a record exists at all: read and act are told apart by what the
//     service said about the tool, and no reading of a name could recover it.
//   - THE CEILING. A service that serves more than a conversation can carry is
//     not silently trimmed. See [mcpToolCeiling].
//   - WHAT IS LEFT OFF, AND SAID SO. A tool whose arguments cannot be read, or
//     whose name cannot be told from another's, is skipped and NAMED in the
//     reply. A dynamic list must never be able to fail the whole arming: an
//     account that serves nine good tools and one broken one arms nine.
//
// ── WHY THE RECORD IS SAFE HERE AND WOULD NOT BE ANYWHERE ELSE ──
//
// connectcaps.go reads a tool's owner OUT OF ITS NAME and says why: a map would
// have to be kept in step with every door onto the belt, and a tool whose owner
// had been forgotten would be a tool with no capability at all. That reasoning
// stands, and this is the one case it cannot serve — the service's answer about
// a tool is a fact no name carries. So the record is written AT THE ONE DOOR
// ONTO THE BELT, in [Agent.rememberServed], immediately before the append that
// puts the tool there, and it is written for a tool that then fails to arm
// rather than the other way round. A record with no tool is dead weight nobody
// reads; a tool with no record would be a tool judged by nothing.
//
// It lives for the session and is never journaled. A resumed conversation starts
// with a belt built from this binary's own literals and asks the account again
// the first time it needs it, which is exactly what makes a served list that
// changed overnight harmless: the records are rebuilt from what the service says
// today.

//
// Some servers list sixty tools. Every one of them is a schema at the front of
// every request for the rest of the conversation, so carrying them all is a bill
// the person pays on every turn for hands the work never touches.
//
// Trimming to the first thirty-two SILENTLY would be the cheap answer and it is
// the wrong one: the model would plan around a list it was never told was cut,
// and the tool it needed would be missing with no sentence anywhere saying why.
// Sorting the read-only ones to the front first would be the same lie with a
// better-looking list. So the rule is the blunt one: under the ceiling
// everything the account serves arrives, and over it NOTHING does — the reply
// names them all and says to ask again for the ones the work needs, which
// use_service's `tools` argument is for. A model that reads that list picks
// three, and the conversation carries three.
