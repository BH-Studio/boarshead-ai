package session

// The error→fix sidecar: what went wrong here before, and what made it go away.
//
// A harness watches every tool call fail and then throws the failure away. The
// next session meets the same error — the same regex flavour ugrep will not
// take, the same build tag, the same binary macOS kills on sight — and pays the
// same three calls to rediscover the same one-line answer. Nothing about that
// needs a model to fix it: the error text is a string, the command that worked
// afterwards is a string, and the pairing is a lookup.
//
// So this file is a lookup, and deliberately nothing more. There is NO MODEL
// CALL ANYWHERE ON THE WRITE PATH — a fix is recorded because a call failed and
// the next call on the same tool succeeded, which is an observation and not a
// judgement — and no tool on the belt (tools.go) reaches any of it. The model is
// never given a verb for this; it is handed ONE LINE appended to a failed tool
// result, and the appending happens in the harness at [Agent.executeTool]'s
// chokepoint (fixrecall.go). Retrieval happens ONLY ON AN ERROR. A store
// consulted before a call would be a store shaping work that was going fine.
//
// ── THE NORMALIZATION LAW ──
//
// OVER-NORMALIZE AND DIFFERENT ERRORS COLLIDE; UNDER-NORMALIZE AND RECURRENCE IS
// INVISIBLE. Both failures are silent, and they fail in opposite directions: a
// signature stripped down to "command exited with code N" matches every failure
// this machine will ever have and offers the wrong patch to all of them, while a
// signature that keeps the byte offset in a regex, or the line number in a build
// error, or the temp directory a test ran in, never matches itself twice and the
// whole sidecar is dead weight. [fixSignature] therefore strips exactly the
// things that vary between two occurrences of ONE error — numbers, quoted
// literals, paths, file:line prefixes, hexadecimal — and keeps every word.
//
// ── WHAT IS KEPT ON DISK ──
//
// One JSON file per scope, holding the entries and the counters that say whether
// any of this is working. The counters live in the store rather than in a metrics
// system so that the product question — is the sidecar earning its place — has an
// answer from the first day, readable with `cat`.
//
// Every write is best-effort in consent.go's sense: temp file, rename, and a
// failure is dropped in silence. AN UNWRITABLE DISK MUST NOT BREAK A SESSION —
// the caller is a person's tool call that has already failed once, and the news
// that a lookup file could not be saved is the least useful thing that could
// happen to them next.

//
// Two terminals open on one project are two processes on one file. A whole-file
// write from the one that loaded first would silently undo everything the other
// learned in between — which for a store whose entire value is accumulated
// counts is not a rounding error, it is the feature turning itself off. The
// merge is cheap because the deltas make it exact: this session knows how many
// confirmations IT added, so it adds them to the disk's number rather than
// replacing it, and two sessions confirming the same fix at the same moment end
// at two rather than one. New entries from either side are kept.
//
// What is still last-writer-wins, and is left that way deliberately: the patch
// TEXT of an entry two sessions created simultaneously with the same key, and
// the decay timestamp. Both are one string, both converge on the next write, and
// neither is a count.
//
// A DELTA IS SPENT ONLY WHEN THE WRITE LANDS. A store on an unwritable disk
// keeps every count it has made this session in memory, so the session still
// gets its own advice; it simply does not outlive the process.
//
