// THE WORK TREE IS ONE SNAPSHOT BOTH SURFACES READ. The rail's folded window
// and a room's full board are two depths of the same picture, and the moment
// they render from two accountings they will disagree about what is running —
// so every surface that says "what is working right now" reads this door and
// nothing else. (docs/HOME-BRIDGE.md states the one-source-of-truth law; this
// file is that law applied to live work.)
//
// A node is a WORKER: a task's own thread, a planned node of an orchestrated
// run, or a child born mid-run when the division gate fired. The tree does not
// say which road created a child — to the person a hand at work is a hand at
// work, and the room is where provenance lives.

// WorkState is the little a row needs to draw a worker: it is moving, it is
// waiting for something (a free hand, an answer), or it has landed.

// WorkingNow is the session's live work as one tree: the session's tasks at
// the top, their workers beneath, born children included the moment they
// exist. An idle session answers nil, and nil renders as nothing — the
// emptiness law.
//
// ── WHAT IS IN THE TREE AND WHAT IS NOT ──
//
// A ROOT IS DRAWN ONLY WHILE SOMETHING UNDER IT IS ALIVE, and once it is drawn
// EVERY worker under it is drawn, settled ones included. The two halves of that
// rule are one decision. A session accumulates finished tasks for as long as it
// runs, and a tree that kept all of them would grow without bound and would say
// "working right now" about work that finished an hour ago — the roster is
// where history is read. But a task that split into three parts and has two of
// them home is a board with three rows on it, and dropping the two that landed
// would leave a person looking at the one part still going with no way to see
// it was ever a division. So liveness decides the ROOT and the root decides the
// family.
//
// AN ID IS SOMETHING A SURFACE CAN ACT ON. The spellings are cancel.go's, the
// one place in this package where both kinds of work already share a
// vocabulary: `task:4` for a node of the task graph, `run:2` for an adaptive
// run, `run:2/node-a` for one planned node inside one, and `job:3` for a
// background job. A reader can hand any of them except the planned node
// straight to [Agent.Cancel]; nothing else in this package mints
// an id that means two different things depending on which kind of work you
// thought you were looking at.
//
// BORN IS WHEN THE WORKER STARTED, and it is deliberately zero for a worker
// that has not started yet — one still waiting for a free hand has no age to
// draw, and zero renders as nothing by the emptiness law. An adaptive run's
// planned nodes carry no start time at all in [orchestrate.Snapshot], so they
// answer zero for the same reason: the honest answer to a question the engine
// cannot answer is nothing.
//
// NEVER FAKE LIVENESS. Every row here is a worker this process is holding — a
// node in the graph or a node on a run's own snapshot. Nothing is invented for
// a shape that has not been admitted yet.
// A BACKGROUND JOB IS A HAND AT WORK. It is not an agent and it has no worker
// under it, but the question this door answers is "is anything happening", and a
// nine-minute command running under `bash background:true` is the plainest
// possible yes. It joins the tree for the same reason it joins the roster
// (jobrow.go): the door that started the work does not change where the work
// shows.
// AND A RUN OF THE BELT IS WORK, which is the plainest statement this door can
// make and was for a long time the one it did not make. A run's rows are kept
// beside the graph rather than in it ([TaskGraph.keepRunRows]), so the walk over
// the graph's own nodes never saw them, and a conversation whose ONLY live work
// was a run read as idle. What reads this answer is the engine deciding whether
// to retire a conversation (internal/remote's workingNow), so the run that was
// invisible here was a run whose conversation was retired out from under it,
// mid-run, at thirty minutes. Saying so here is what keeps the engine alive
// while a run lives; nothing else had to change to get that.

// THE ID IS THE ONE A PERSON CAN ALREADY ACT ON. A run is known to every surface
// by the number of the row it was published under, and that number is what the

//
