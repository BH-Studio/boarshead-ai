package session

// answers.go is how an answer reaches a session that is stopped on a question
// in ANOTHER window.
//
// taskpresence.go carries the question outward: a live session blocked on a
// card writes what it is asking, with the answers it will take, into its
// presence file, and any other window may read it without opening a journal or
// taking a lock. This file is the return path, and it is deliberately the
// simplest thing that works — internal/standing's inbox.go in the other
// direction: ONE JSONL FILE in the session's own folder, appended by whoever
// answered, drained whole by the session itself on the heartbeat it already
// runs.
//
// ── THE THREE LAWS ──
//
//   - AN ANSWER IS APPLIED THROUGH THE SAME RESOLVER A SURFACE USES. There is
//     no second door into the approval gate, the task proposal or the standing
//     card: [Agent.applyAnswer] calls [Agent.ResolveConsentRemember],
//     [Agent.ResolveTask] and [Agent.ResolveStanding], which is exactly what the
//     card in the window calls. A lane of its own would be a second place that
//     decides what "yes" does, and the two would drift on the day one of them
//     learned something.
//
//   - A LATE ANSWER IS IGNORED, AND NOTHING SAYS SO. The resolvers already drop
//     an id nobody is waiting on — a question the clock approved, a card the
//     person answered in its own window a second earlier, a turn that was
//     interrupted — and an answer arriving through a file is late in exactly
//     those ways and no new ones. So this file adds no staleness rule of its
//     own; it hands the id over and lets the one rule that exists apply.
//
//   - THE KEY IS THE ANSWER'S NAME, AND THE MAPPING IS WRITTEN ONCE.
//     [AnswerOptions] says which keys a kind of question takes and what each of
//     them is called; [AnswerFromKey] says what one of them MEANS. Both live
//     here, in the engine, because the surface that draws the chips and the
//     session that applies the answer must agree about them completely — a
//     surface offering a key the session does not take is a chip that does
//     nothing, and a surface whose "2" means something else than the session's
//     is worse than either.
//
// ── THE FILE ──
//
//	<session dir>/answers.jsonl
//
// One JSON object per line: when it was given, which question it answers, and
// the key. JSONL and not JSON because two windows could answer two questions in
// the same instant and an append never loses one — the opposite of presence.json
// next to it, which has exactly one writer and one fact and is replaced whole.
//
// THE DRAIN RENAMES BEFORE IT READS, for standing's own reason: an answer
// delivered while the file is being read would otherwise be read and then
// deleted unapplied. Moving it aside first means a racing write starts a fresh
// file that the next beat finds.

//
// AND THE WORDS ARE THE CARD'S OWN TOO. A person reading `just once` on the card
// and `once, not standing` on home would be reading two names for one answer,
// and the second of them is written in this build's vocabulary rather than
// theirs — "standing" is a word they never said. One answer, one spelling,
