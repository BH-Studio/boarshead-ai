// THE CASCADE: WHERE A CHEAP CREW BUYS THE CAREFUL MODEL, AND WHERE IT DOES NOT.
//
// One escalation exists in this build (repair_role.go): work a checker sent back
// is handed to [roles.RoleRepair], which sits on the careful tier. Four things have to
// hold for that to be an economy rather than a leak, and each of them is a test
// here:
//
//   - it happens on the REPAIR ROUND and nowhere else — the first attempt is the
//     cheap crew's, exactly as it was;
//   - a model somebody NAMED for the work wins over it, because the cascade is a
//     default and not an override;
//   - an all-flash crew floors onto its own model with no branch and no error;
//   - and the escalation is WRITTEN DOWN when it happens, so the money can be
//     found afterwards, and not written down when it did not.
//
// The fifth is what the escalated model is actually asked: the gaps, the frozen
// acceptance, and the change as it stands — never the whole repository again.
