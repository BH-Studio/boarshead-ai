// question.go is ONE OBJECT FOR EVERY DECISION THIS ENGINE HANDS TO A PERSON.
//
// Before this file there were thirteen of them. The approval gate, the connect
// offer, the harness offer, the harness design, the sub-harness proposal, a
// running sub-harness's own question, the standing card, the task proposal, a
// landed task's `your call`, the merge conflict, the fuel gate, the stuck-turn
// recovery and the auto-settle take-back each minted their own id, banked their
// own wait, emitted their own event and were answered through their own door —
// and the September 2026 questions audit counted twenty-one distinct question
// mechanisms across fourteen answer surfaces, three of which could draw an
// answer row at all. Two of those doors had no caller anywhere in the product.
//
// A person does not have thirteen kinds of decision. They have one: somebody is
// asking me something, here is what it is about, here is what I may say. So
// this file states that object once — [Question] — and every lane above is
// expressed in it.
//
// ── WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DO ──
//
// IT ADDS NO SECOND STORE. [Agent.OpenQuestions] is DERIVED, every time, from
// the waits the lanes already keep: the consent map, the connect asks, the
// harness asks, the standing answers, the task proposals, the sub-harness
// offers and questions, the orchestrator's pause and the task graph's own
// [PendingDecision] registry. A list of open questions kept beside those would
// be the second place a question could be open, and the two would disagree the
// first hour a lane learned to close one on a road that forgot to tell this
// file (pending.go states the same law about its own registry, in its own
// words).
//
// AND IT CHANGES NOTHING A PERSON SEES. Every resolver still resolves exactly
// what it resolved; every event a surface draws today is still emitted, in the
// same order, with the same fields. What is new is a second, wider description
// of the same moment, which the surfaces take up one lane at a time.
//
// ── THE TWO WORDS FOR "KIND", AND WHY THERE ARE TWO ──
//
// [QuestionKind] (answers.go) is the LANE: which part of the engine is stopped,
// and therefore which resolver an answer is applied through. It was already
// spelled, already on disk in presence files, already read by home and by the
// `--host` link, and this file extends its list rather than renaming it.
//
// [AskKind] is the SHAPE OF THE DECISION: is this a permission, a choice, a
// judgement, a clarification, a confirmation, a landing, an assumption, a
// ratification. It is what decides how a question is drawn, what may answer it
// without a person, and what a safe answer is.
//
// They are orthogonal on purpose. Two lanes can raise the same shape — the
// approval gate and the sub-harness proposal are both permissions — and one
// lane can raise two shapes, which is exactly what the consent lane does when
// recovery.go borrows it to ask about a TURN instead of a tool. A single enum
// would have had to pick one of those facts to be, and the surfaces need both.
//
// ── THE LADDER, AND WHY THE GATE REFUSES RATHER THAN REPAIRS ──
//
// docs/design/questions/DESIGN.md states the ladder an asker climbs before it
// puts a question to anybody: read the record, assume and say so, act then
// ratify, show outcomes, offer structured input, and only then ask. [Question.Check]
// is where the last rung is defended, and it REFUSES rather than filling
// anything in: a question with no reason is a question the asker had not
// finished thinking about, and a gate that supplied the missing sentence would
// be writing the reason a person then reads as the asker's.
//
// Every refusal it makes ends in something the asker can DO — "decide, or state
// the assumption" — because the model on the other side of it has to be able to
// act on the refusal without asking a second time.

//

// reads, and a number whose meaning moved when somebody inserted a constant is
// the one bug a wire format must not have.
