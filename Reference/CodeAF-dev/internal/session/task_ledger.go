// task_ledger.go is one law, said once, for every family that lands.
//
// ── THE LEDGER IS THE CONTRACT OF WHAT SHIPS; THE TREE IS ONLY THE MEDIUM ──
//
// A landing carries the paths a node wrote and nothing else. [stageTaskWork]
// stages that list, [taskTree.landMirror] lays it back over a folder ground by
// name, and everything downstream — the card, the project index, the check —
// reads the same list. Walking the directory instead would carry home every
// virtualenv, cache and build output a run left lying beside the work, which is
// the defect the whole of task_landing_test.go exists about.
//
// A NODE THAT HANDED WORK OUT BREAKS THAT LIST IN HALF. Its parts worked in ITS
// tree and wrote their paths onto THEIR OWN ledgers, so the parent's list names
// the parent's slice of a deliverable the parent no longer wrote most of. On a
// repository ground the gap is invisible, because a part's work arrives as
// commits on the very tree the parent merges — the ledger composes there through
// git rather than through anything written down. On a folder ground nothing
// composes it: the mirror held all three files, the ledger named one, and the
// person's folder got one. The task said done, the check passed against the
// mirror, and the parts' work was lost in silence (#229).
//
// SO THE LEDGER COMPOSES EVERYWHERE, and it composes at the LANDING rather than
// in the copier: [taskTree.comeHome] keeps reading exactly one list, and what
// changed is that the list is now complete. That also makes the fold recursive
// for free — a part absorbs its own parts before it settles, so by the time a
// root reads its children's leavings a grandchild's paths are already on them —
// and it leaves a repository ground where it was, since the paths it adds there
// are paths git is already carrying.
//
// A PART THAT WROTE NOTHING ABSORBS NOTHING, and a part that never landed is not
// on the ledger at all: work that is not in the parent's tree may not be claimed
// by the parent's landing ([landingFilesFor] holds both).

// absorbedLedger is a node's effective ledger: what its own worker wrote, with
// every landed part's paths folded in, in the order they were first written and
// never named twice.
//
// It is [landingFiles] read as ONE list rather than as two. The two halves exist
// for the checker's packet alone, where "it wrote" has to stay a true claim
// about this node and its parts are named in a sentence of their own
// (task_audit.go's [auditQuestion]). A landing has no such question to answer —
// what ships is what the family made — so it reads the whole of it.
//
// IT IS IDEMPOTENT, which is what lets a road that runs after a landing call it
// again without knowing whether an earlier one already did: the parts come from
// the graph and the rest of the list is left where it is ([landingFilesFor]).

// landHome is THE ONE PLACE A NODE'S WORK COMES HOME: finalize the ledger, then
// land it. Every road that merges goes through it — the ordinary finishing line,
// the threshold's ([Agent.landStopped]), a person's accept and a late verdict
// (task_audit.go) — and it answers the finalized ledger so that the [TaskNode.finish]
// under each of them writes the SAME list onto the node.
//
// THAT LAST HALF IS NOT A CONVENIENCE. A node's ledger outlives its run: a
// family that landed unverified is settled hours later by somebody typing
// `accept`, and that road has nothing to read but what the first landing wrote
// down. While the fold lived at the merge alone, an accepted mirror family laid
// the parent's slice over the person's folder and dropped every part's file —
// the same loss as before, one road further along.

// landFinished is THE ONE ENDING FOR WORK THAT HOLDS, and it is one function
// because it was three.
//
// A node whose deliverable stands has the same three things left to do whoever
// decided that: ask whether the ground moved under it, merge, and ask of the
// outcome whether anything actually landed before it settles. That
// sequence was written out three times — once on the ordinary finishing line,
// once for a family whose verification is switched off, and once for a node the
// counter stopped whose work was checked anyway ([Agent.landStopped]) — and each
// copy had to remember the ground check, the conflict test and the ledger the
// merge answers with. THE MEMORY IS EXACTLY WHAT FAILED: the checks the family
// audit filed (#255, #256, #258) each had to be added to every copy, and the one
// that was missed was the one nobody was looking at. Written once, a check added
// here is a check every road home gets.
//
// ── THE TWO HALVES OF THE REPORT, AND WHY THEY ARE PARAMETERS ──
//
// Every road home composes the same report out of two sentences in a fixed
// relationship: `head` is what leads, `tail` stands under it, and the merge's own
// detail goes under both. On the ordinary line the node's own account leads and
// what it was checked on stands under it; on a family with the check switched off
// the sentence saying so leads and the node's account stands under it. The
// composition never varies, only which sentence takes which place — so it is the
// caller's answer, and the folding is stated here once.
//
// `note` is what the log line says about this particular road, and it is empty
// for the ordinary one. The person's report never carries it: a threshold that
// fired is machinery, and a reader of a card that says done has no use for it
// ([Agent.landStopped] states the whole of that argument).
