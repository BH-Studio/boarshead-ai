// ── QUESTIONS GO UP AS DECISION PACKETS ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// The ruling (c-5, c-7): the person talks to the top manager and steps away,
// so a member's clarifying question goes to the manager it reports to first
// (its HOME, teams' home.go), and only what no manager may or can decide
// reaches the person. Whatever travels up travels as one self-contained
// DECISION PACKET ([teams.Packet]): the question, the asker's context, the
// options each with what happens if it is chosen, and the asker's own pick
// with its reason, so whoever decides it never has to read a transcript.
//
// THE ROAD, end to end:
//
//   - A member calls `ask` with a clarifying question (a clarification, a
//     choice or a confirmation) while `questions_up` is on for the team it
//     reports to ([teams.Effective], inherited). Nothing is put on the
//     person's screen: [Agent.askUp] raises a question packet addressed to
//     the home manager's team and hands the model back a sentence saying
//     so. The call does not park: a manager may take minutes, and a tool call
//     parked across two conversations is a turn nobody can stop cleanly.
//   - The raise appends a [teams.KindPacket] line to the team's Traffic, and
//     the manager's traffic watch wakes it on that line
//     ([Agent.teamPacketWakes]); its delivery hands it the packet whole
//     ([teamPacketLine]).
//   - The manager answers with `team_decide`, or sends it up with
//     `team_escalate` to its own manager or to the person. The decision is one
//     more packet line, which wakes the member and is delivered to it marked
//     `◆ answered: …`, and the Traffic rail reads `answered @web: …`.
//
// PERMISSION PROMPTS NEVER TAKE THIS ROAD. They are the approval gate's, not
// `ask`'s, and a manager may not answer one (section 5 of the design); only the
// kinds in [askGoesUp] do, and a permission kind written into `ask` stays the
// person's.
//
// A MANAGER'S OWN QUESTION is a packet too: to its own home manager when it has
// one and questions go up there, and otherwise to the person (addressed
// [teams.Person], `you`), where the teams page's inbox shows it. The person's
// decision reaches the manager by the same delivery and wakes it.
