// A RUN HELD AT ITS FUEL GATE SAYS SO ON THE ROSTER.
//
// The gate was visible in exactly one place — the run's own page, which somebody
// has to know to open — and the row every other surface draws went on saying the
// run was working. These pin the other half: the run's OWN row carries the gate
// from the moment the tank empties until somebody answers, the workers under it
// go on saying what they are actually doing, and nothing that publishes a row
// afterwards can take the gate off by accident.
