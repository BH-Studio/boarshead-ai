// These run against the real adapter over a scripted SSE stream, so what is
// pinned is the whole path a reply takes: the wire, internal/provider's one
// decision about what is answer and what is working (answer.go), this package's
// events, and the message the transcript keeps. THE LAST TWO MUST AGREE — what
// a replay shows later has to be what streaming showed live, and the two
// disagreeing is the report's own symptom.

// eventTexts is every delta of one kind, joined.
