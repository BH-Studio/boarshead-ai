// Teams suggested for a person's conversations, asked once per press.
//
// The conversations view has an Organize button. The surface groups the
// conversations that share a project folder itself, which is free and exact,
// and asks here once for the groupings a folder cannot see: conversations about
// one topic spread over several folders, or one that belongs in a team the
// person already made.
//
// IT IS NAMETEAM'S ERRAND WITH A LONGER LIST. It goes through the same door
// ([Agent.callRoleChecked]) on the same role ([roles.RoleTitle]), so it lands on
// the cheap tier a person has configured for names, falls through one rung at
// most, and is billed against the model that answered, off every turn's clock.
//
// WHAT COMES BACK IS A PROPOSAL AND IS READ AS ONE. Every conversation and team
// is handed to the model under a short ref (c1, t1) and every ref in the answer
// is looked up again: one it was not given is dropped, a team left with too few
// members is dropped, a name is cleaned as a team name is, and nothing in the
// answer can remove a member or rename a team, because the answer has no field
// that could say so and a new team named like an existing one is read as
// additions to it. The surface shows what is left and applies only what the
// person ticks.
