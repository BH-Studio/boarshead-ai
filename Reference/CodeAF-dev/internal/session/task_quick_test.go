// THE QUICK TASK, END TO END, THROUGH THE REAL RUNNER.
//
// Every test here drives a real conversation with a scripted model: the chat
// calls `quick_task`, the graph admits a node, the frontier starts it, a real
// worker agent runs in the caller's own workspace, and the node lands. Nothing
// about the road is stubbed — only the model is — because the four things this
// wave has to be true about are all facts about the ROAD: that two of them run
// at once, that two claiming one file do not, that ticking an item moves the
// row a person is watching, and that one started under a task reports to that
// task rather than to the conversation.
