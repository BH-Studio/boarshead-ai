// ONE LEDGER, ONE NUMBER (issue #269).
//
// Money used to be BANKED PER CALL and JOURNALED PER TURN: [Agent.addUsage]
// moved the meter as each answer was decoded, and [Agent.sealTurn] wrote the
// machine's ledger once at the end. Every turn that failed to seal —
// interrupted, stopped, crashed, or simply still running while somebody looked —
// was money the meter had and the ledger never got. On the measured chat that
// was $0.087, every call of a final interrupted turn, and four surfaces quoting
// four numbers for one instant.
//
// These tests are the acceptance the issue asks for: the equality that was red,
// the property that keeps it true call by call, the fold rule that must survive
// the move, and the counter that makes a lost row visible instead of flattering.
