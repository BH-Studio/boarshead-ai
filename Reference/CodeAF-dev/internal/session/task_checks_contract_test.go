// WHAT A CHECKER MAY MAKE HAPPEN, MEASURED ON A SCRIPT THAT COUNTS ITS OWN RUNS.
//
// The live failure these cases are written from: a task was asked to run a slow
// build script ONCE and report the marker it wrote. The worker ran it, exit 0,
// and read the marker back — and the checker, which read that receipt as a door,
// ran the same script again. Every case here is about the difference between
// evidence of what ran and permission to run it, and the counter file is what
// makes the difference something a test can see rather than something a comment
// asserts.
