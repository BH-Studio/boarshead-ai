package session

// THE FIXED PREFIX, AND WHAT IT COSTS TO LET IT GROW.
//
// Two things ride in front of every request this session makes: the system
// prompt, which is message[0], and the tool schema block, which is encoded ahead
// of message[0]. Neither depends on what anybody said. They are sent again, in
// full, on every tool round of every turn — a measured benchmark cell made 69
// requests and paid for both 69 times.
//
// That is what makes a byte here different from a byte anywhere else in this
// repository. A sentence added to a Go comment is free. A sentence added to a
// tool description is bought roughly sixty times per task, and again on the next
// task, forever. When this prefix was last measured against a competing harness
// it was 26,400 tokens against their 3,500 — 45.6% of every prompt token that
// cell spent, on text that taught the model nothing it had not already been
// told twice on the same page.
//
// The prompt cache does not make this free either. Caching discounts the tokens;
// it does not stop them being sent, counted, or re-priced in full the moment any
// byte in front of them moves (prefixcache_test.go states that half of it).
//
// So this test is a BUDGET, not a measurement. It fails when the fixed prefix
// grows past what the diet left it plus a margin, and its failure message names
// the tool that grew, because the lane that adds a paragraph to a description is
// otherwise the one person in the loop who never sees the bill.
//
// WHAT TO DO WHEN IT FAILS. Not raise the number — that is the one move that
// makes the failure meaningless. Find the sentence you added and ask whether it
// states a rule the model does not already have. A schema description teaches
// what a field is FOR in the fewest words that keep the law; the system prompt
// states each law once. If the addition genuinely carries a new law, take the
// bytes back out of something that repeats one, and leave the budget where it
// is.

// fixedPrefixBudget bounds the system prompt plus the marshalled tool block of
// the belt the shipping conversation door assembles (belt_wiring_test.go's
// [shippedShapeAgent] is that shape).
//
// ── IT WEIGHED THE WRONG BELT FOR MONTHS, AND THIS IS THAT REPAIR ───────────
//
// The sentence above has always said "the shipping conversation". The fixture
// under it was [v3ShapedAgent]: a conversation with NO memory store, NO accounts
// hub, NO standing items and NO saved programs — eighteen tools, 39,073 bytes,
// comfortably green. A machine somebody has finished setting up carries five
// more (`stand`, `search_conversations`, `remember`, and the subharness pair)
// and weighs 53,025. So the gate reported eight kilobytes of headroom on a
// prefix that was five kilobytes OVER the cap it was enforcing, and it reported
// it every day. That is #576's shape exactly: a gate pointed at something nobody
// runs passes without having tested anything.
//
// ── SO THE FIGURE IS A RATCHET NOW, AND NOT A BUDGET WITH ROOM IN IT ────────
//
// It used to be "the post-diet measurement plus about a tenth", which was right
// when the number came out of a diet that had just been paid for: the headroom
// was room for a genuinely new law. It is wrong here, because this measurement
// is not the end of a diet — it is the first honest weighing of a prefix that
// has never been weighed, and it is already past what the last diet aimed at. A
// tenth of headroom on top of that would be five more kilobytes nobody chose.
//
// So it is the measurement and nothing else. Anything that grows the shipped
// prefix fails the build and has to be paid for out of what is already here,
// which is what a ratchet is for and what the old figure could not do.
//
// ── AND IT IS THE WIDEST MACHINE'S MEASUREMENT, NOT THIS ONE'S ──────────────
//
// The first spelling of this ratchet was 53,100 — the laptop it was written on
// weighing 53,025 — and it failed on the runner that proved it, at 53,132. The
// prefix is not the same size everywhere: `grep` says a longer sentence about
// itself where ripgrep is absent (134 bytes, and [widestBelt] now weighs that
// spelling wherever it runs), and `load_capability` lists the tool groups THIS
// BUILD has, which is 27 more bytes on a machine that can edit video than on one
// that cannot. A gate whose number depends on who runs it is a gate that passes
// where it is written and fails where it is proved, so the figure is the widest
// machine's and the swap that makes the biggest term machine-independent lives
// in [widestBelt].
//
// The residual is the shelf, and it is owed rather than done: `load_capability`
// would have to name what this build COULD have rather than what it has, which
// is a change to what the model is told and belongs to whoever owns the shelf.
// It is bounded — one short clause per group — and it is why this number was
// measured on the machine that carries every group. It is filed as issue #1010,
// which is also where the `grep` sentence and [widestBelt] itself are deleted:
// removing the variance at its source is the only thing that makes this number
// one number for everybody.
//
// ── WHAT IS OWED, AND WHERE IT HAS TO COME FROM ─────────────────────────────
//
// THE TARGET IS STILL [fixedPrefixTarget] and the shipped prefix is over it by the
// difference between the two constants below. The bill
// is not spread thin — one tool is more than a quarter of the whole tool block:
//
//	stand                  9,607   the standing-item verb's schema
//	propose_task           4,363
//	tasks                  2,272
//	search_conversations   1,613
//	watch                  1,396
//
// `stand` alone is nearly twice the next heaviest and more than the whole overage.
// It is not this file's to cut: what a tool's schema says is its contract with
// the model, and trimming it is a change to what the model is told rather than
// to a byte count. It belongs to whoever owns internal/session's standing belt,
// with the same discipline the 2026-09-10 diet used on `propose_task` — one
// clause per field, no rule stated twice, no em dashes — and it is filed here
// rather than done here because a gate is not the place to decide what a verb
// means.
//
// It is a byte count and not a token count deliberately: bytes are what this
// process can measure exactly, and every tokenizer this build talks to is within
// a small factor of four bytes to the token.
//
// The diet that set it left the prefix at 41,684 bytes — 21,499 of system prompt
// and 20,185 of tool block, down from 37,285 and 32,097. Of what remains, 6,551
// bytes are the seven tools this belt takes VERBATIM from pi (internal/exec's
// bare package): they are the lean baseline the diet was measured against and
// are not codeaf's to trim. The other 35,133 bytes are codeaf's own words, down
// from 62,810 — and that is the half of the bill a lane adding a sentence is
// adding to. The budget is that measurement plus a tenth.
// WHAT HAS BEEN SPENT AND WHAT PAID FOR IT. The working discipline moved into
// the system prompt (prompt.go's [disciplinePrompt]) because the surface that
// picks the approach must carry the discipline for picking it, and it cost 1,779
// bytes. It was paid for, not borrowed: the `# Tool Inventory` section came out,
// 1,832 bytes of prose naming each tool and paraphrasing its description — the
// tool block ahead of message[0] carries every one of those descriptions in
// full, and prompts/system.md's Tool Policy names each tool again where it says
// which one to reach for. The prefix came out 32 bytes lighter than it went in.
// THE MERGE WITH chat-v3-task (2026-08-27). autonomy/v0 sat 39 bytes under
// 45,800. The merge carries two things the v3 side had added on its own
// trunk, neither of them a sentence a lane grew here: `write`'s `append:true`
// (523 bytes of schema and the Tool Policy line naming it) and the media-
// making law (~1.5 KB under `read`/media in the Tool Policy). Dropping either
// in a merge would be a silent regression of a shipped v3 behaviour, so the
// budget moves by what was carried and a little headroom — 48,000 — and the
// follow-up is to say the media law in this file's register (the `read
// perceives media` line was already cut to a third here), not to raise this
// number again.
// THE VIDEO WAVE PAID FOR ITSELF AND FOR #238 (2026-09-01). `edit_video` put
// 1,873 bytes on the belt and landed the prefix 2,632 over, on top of the 758
// #238 had been carrying since the merge above. Nothing was raised and no rule
// was dropped: 3,464 bytes came out of text that stated a law a SECOND time.
// prompts/system.md lost the media-making essay (the manual's own
// making-pictures-audio-and-video page teaches all of it, and `manual` is a
// tool the model can call), the paragraphs restating `bash`, `jobs`, `tasks`,
// `manual`, `build_harness` and `change_setting`'s own descriptions
// back at the model, and the three-part propose_task contract its own schema
// fields spell out field by field. It went 23,954 → 20,589; the tool block went
// 26,678 → 26,579; the prefix is 47,168, which is 832 under.
// THE CAPTION WAVE PAID FOR ITSELF OUT OF THE STANDING SECTION (2026-09-03).
// #563 asked the model for one short present-tense line before each tool batch
// and put 319 bytes of prompt on a prefix that was already 5 under, which is
// how it landed 314 over. Nothing was raised: 783 bytes came out of `# Things
// that keep working after this window`, where the recognition warning, the
// discharge test and the anchoring rule were the SECOND copy of what
// `stand`'s own description already says at greater length (tools_standing.go's
// [standDescription], which owns all three by name). A belt without `stand`
// loses nothing either — that section opens by saying it is about the tool. The
// prompt went 21,495 → 20,712 and the prefix is 47,531, which is 469 under.
// THE HANDOFF LAW PAID FOR ITSELF OUT OF A SENTENCE SAID TWICE (2026-09-04). A
// live run ended a turn that had handed its work to a task and was told the ask
// was not finished, so the page now says a handed-off outcome is not work that
// remains — 210 bytes across `## Work or words` and `# Critical`. Nothing was
// raised: the belt's `needs your look` bullet lost its "continue task N"
// sentence, which `tasks` own description already carries word for word
// (tools_tasks.go's [tasksDescription]), and the page went 21,289 → 20,840. The
// prefix is 47,920, which is 80 under.
// AND THE CAUSAL WAVE CAME IN UNDER WHAT IT REPLACED (2026-09-04). A woken turn
// now answers the request its result belongs to, so the landed-work paragraph
// says which request that is (+23), and the handoff receipt lost the clause the
// `# Critical` bullet above already carries (-33). Nothing was raised: the page
// went 20,840 → 20,830 and the prefix is 47,958, which is 42 under.
// THE VERIFICATION CONTRACT PAID FOR ITSELF OUT OF THREE SENTENCES SAID TWICE
// (2026-09-04). `propose_task` and `divide_work` grew a `checks` field — the
// repeatable verification a piece of work is put under contract with, which is
// the only thing its checker may run (task_checks.go) — and it landed the prefix
// 388 over. Nothing was raised. `acceptance` gave up "the command that passes",
// which is now the field next to it; `wide` gave up the two sentences
// prompts/system.md's own handoff section already spells; `model`, `max_steps`
// and `no_progress` gave up their tails about what the harness then does; and the
// belt's `tasks` bullet lost its `id` sentence, which [tasksDescription] carries
// in full. The two waves together leave the prefix at the figure the test prints;
// neither raised the budget and the ledger above is what each of them paid.
// AND THE FORWARDING DOOR PAID FOR ITSELF OUT OF THREE SECOND COPIES
// (2026-09-04). The person steering from the main chat needs one more field on
// `tasks` and one clause on the belt saying when to reach for it (+301, mostly
// the field's own "their words, never yours"). Nothing was raised: the tool's
// description lost the "continue task N" sentence and the URI sentence, both of
// which the `continue` field and the belt's own citation bullet already carry
// word for word; `id` lost "Running, it answers with its LIVE state", which the
// belt bullet under it says at greater length; and the belt lost the
// `scope: "everywhere"` clause the `scope` field governs. The tool block went
// 27,128 → 27,169, the page 20,830 → 20,797, and the prefix is 47,966, which is
// 34 under.
// Specialist discovery (2026-09-05) reduced this fixture's tool block from
// 27,079 to 23,438 bytes. The widest prompt grew from 20,527 to 20,909 bytes
// to explain loading, leaving 44,347 combined: 3,259 fewer than the 47,606
// baseline. The 48,000-byte cap stays unchanged. With every media model and
// saved procedure configured, the complete tool block is 40,595 bytes and
// discovery carries 26,740, including its 708-byte loader. Measure whole JSON
// arrays rather than adding separately encoded array sizes.
// THE DIET'S DELETE PASS TOOK 677 BYTES AND ADDED A LAW (2026-09-10). Lane C of
// the prompt diet (docs/design/prompt-diet/DESIGN.md §1) deleted the SECOND and
// THIRD copies of five rules and put ONE new sentence in their place, and the
// new sentence is the reason the deletions are safe rather than merely cheap:
// "anything handed off — a job, a watch, a task, a quick task — reports itself
// into this conversation; never sleep, tail or poll for it" is 142 bytes that
// says once what ten per-tool sentences were saying separately. Against it,
// 819 bytes came out of text that stated a law already stated: the ask law was
// on the page twice and in the belt fact under it a third time, so the ladder
// bullet keeps it and the other two are gone; `# Critical`'s informed-action
// bullet was the second telling of "never ask what the record answers";
// prompts/system.md taught `write`'s append and `read`'s offset/limit, which
// tools_write.go's [appendSentence] and bare's readDescription own word for
// word; "Start ONE `watch`" contradicted [watchDescription]'s own count and is
// gone; and the ask and settings belt facts gave up the two sentences about
// what `load_capability` does once it is called, which is that tool's own
// description. Nothing was raised. The page went 23,391 → 22,714, the tool
// block is unmoved at 24,044, and the prefix is 46,758 — 1,242 under.
// lawregistry_test.go is what keeps it there: every law above is filed under an
// id and a class, and a second copy of one is now a build failure rather than a
// thing the next audit finds.
// AND THE EVENT LANE PAID NOTHING AND TOOK 2,189 BYTES BACK (2026-09-10). The
// prompt diet's WITH THE EVENT pass (docs/design/prompt-diet/DESIGN.md §2): a
// harness-authored message now carries its own reading instruction, so the page
// stopped explaining messages it may never see. A landed task's note opens on
// [landingNoteLead] — 234 bytes on the turn a task lands, with the tier word
// interpolated — and a job's ending carries [jobExitNewsRule]. In exchange
// `# Interrupts and steering` lost the woken-turn and `[carry on]` paragraphs
// (the messages say all of it, and [checkpointCarryOnLead] has said its own
// half since it was written), `# Session facts` lost the four-words, `your
// call` and saying-stop bullets, and the belt's `tasks` fact lost its second
// copy of the four words and the resolve verbs — [settleClause] interpolates
// those from [TaskResolutions] on the note itself, and `tasks` own description
// owns "To END running work use stop". Nothing was raised and no law left the
// build. On dev alone it was 23,391 → 21,202; landing after lane C's delete
// pass it is 22,714 → 20,525, and the two together leave the prefix at 44,569,
// which is 3,431 under. Neither raised the budget.
// AND THE TOOL DESCRIPTIONS GAVE BACK 1,221 BYTES AND ADDED A LAW (2026-09-10,
// the prompt diet, lane F). The tool block went 24,044 → 22,823 and nothing was
// raised; the prompt is untouched by this lane, so the prefix went 47,435 →
// 46,214. Every byte came out of text that said something a SECOND time. The
// handed-off-work-reports-itself law was written four times across the belt —
// twice in `jobs`, once in `watch`, once in `propose_task` — and is now on the
// page once; `read`'s senses sentence enumerated what a picture, a recording and
// a video each come back as, where "described, never as bytes" is the whole rule
// (322 → 95); and the routing sentences left `tasks` (three of them),
// `read_document` and `recall` for the page's routing table, which states each
// once for the whole belt rather than once per tool. Per tool: tasks 2,738 →
// 2,272, read 1,169 → 952, jobs 1,103 → 802, watch 1,495 → 1,396, read_document
// 819 → 754, recall 324 → 269, manual 616 → 603, commit 330 → 325, track 787
// unchanged. schemalaw_test.go is the gate that keeps it: a parameter
// description past 200 bytes, or shouting, or reaching for a dash, now fails the
// build instead of waiting for this number to notice it. Merged with the page
// passes above, the prefix is 43,348 — page 20,525 and tools 22,823, which is
// 4,652 under a cap no lane of this wave moved. And `watch.instead-of-polling`
// left lawregistry_test.go with the sentence it filed: `handoff.reports-itself`
// now matches on "never sleep, tail or poll", so putting any of the four
// per-tool copies back fails that gate wherever it is put.
// THE DIET'S ON-DEMAND LANE PAID 3,854 BYTES BACK AND ASKED FOR NOTHING
// (2026-09-10). Four runs of prose came off prompts/system.md and message[0]
// stopped carrying any of them, because each one is already delivered by
// whoever needs it and only then (docs/design/prompt-diet/DESIGN.md §2):
//   - the standing section, 2,482 bytes, is one existence line. Its mechanics
//     are tools_standing.go's [standDescription] and [standSchemaJSON], beside
//     the field each governs; its `[something you set up fired]` frame is
//     standing_run.go's [standingNewsRule], already under the firing's own line;
//     the rest is the chat manual's keeping-an-eye page.
//   - the two paragraphs defining a saved recipe and a saved program are the
//     `harnesses` group's own prose (tools_capabilities.go), emitted under the
//     `Loaded:` line by the load that fetches the four verbs. The page keeps the
//     routing line that names `list_harnesses` and `build_harness`.
//   - the accounts block, 1,142 bytes over three bullets, is one existence line.
//     [serviceRequestDescription] already names the address and says which half
//     the person turned off; the send verbs already say they are asked about
//     first and cannot be called back.
//   - the media-making essay is the `media` group's prose, and the page keeps
//     one line: anchor in a real medium, specify positively, `manual` for the
//     rest. `generate_image` and `generate_video` state it a third time in the
//     `prompt` field, where it is read at the call.
//
// Nothing was raised and no law was dropped, and each of the four is filed in
// lawregistry_test.go under class `demand` with the place that now owns it. On
// its own, on top of lane C's delete pass, it took the page 22,714 → 18,860;
// landing beside the event and description lanes above it leaves the page at
// 16,671, the tool block at 22,823 which it did not touch, and the prefix at
// 39,494 — 8,506 under.
// AND THE ROUTING TABLE BOUGHT BACK 226 BYTES OF WHAT THE DESCRIPTIONS GAVE UP
// (2026-09-10). A description states a contract and never when to reach for the
// verb (DESIGN.md §4), so when the tool lane took the routing prose off
// `tasks`, `read_document` and the rest, three triggers had nowhere left to be
// said: that a look inside running or landed work is `tasks` with its id, that
// "continue task N" is that id with `continue` and never a fresh
// `propose_task` — which mints a second task with a fresh brief and a fresh
// working copy (task_continue.go) — and that `read` is the door for text,
// source and a PDF that has a text layer, `read_document` only for what `read`
// cannot turn into text at all. The first two ride the `tasks` belt fact,
// because a floor node carries neither verb; the third is two clauses folded
// into the `read` bullet that was already there. Nothing was raised, nothing
// was said twice (all three are filed in lawregistry_test.go under class
// `core`), and the "earlier work referred to but not pointed at" trigger was
// left exactly where it already was rather than restated here. The page went
// 16,671 → 16,897, the tool block is unmoved at 22,823, and the prefix is
// 39,720 — 8,280 under.
// ATTRIBUTION COST 863 BYTES AND 333 OF THEM ARE THE FEATURE (2026-09-10). Lane
// I of the prompt diet gave the chat the law the resident has had all along, and
// a third case with it: codeaf signs the git work it does in somebody's name —
// one trailer on a commit, one footer line on a pull request or issue body, and
// one small `<sub>` line on the FIRST comment it leaves in a thread and no later
// one. It is a law this page did not state at all, so nothing was deleted for it;
// there was no second copy to delete.
//
// THE FLOOR IS THE CONSTANTS AND THE FLOOR IS 333 BYTES. The trailer, the pull
// footer and the comment line are constants because the exact bytes are what
// attributes — a footer the model half-remembers counts as nothing — so this is
// the one law on the belt that cannot be paraphrased down. What IS paid for: the
// issue footer is named by the single utm parameter that differs rather than
// spelled a second time (145 bytes), and the law is four sentences, three places
// and one nowhere-else, with no example and no reasoning.
//
// It is also CONDITIONAL — off with the row off, off in a hand whose bash cannot
// commit — so this figure is the widest page and not everybody's. On dev alone
// the page was 22,714 → 23,577; landing after lanes A, C, D and F it is
// 16,898 → 17,761, the tool block is unmoved by this lane at 22,823, and the
// prefix is 40,584 — 7,416 under, and the cap is untouched.
// AND THE RESULT CAPS PAID 652 BYTES ON THE WAY TO FIXING A DEFECT (2026-09-10).
// Lane B (§5 item 1) made every result cap a share of the model's window instead
// of a flat 2000 lines / 50KB, which meant the figures had to be rendered from
// the caps in force rather than typed — and a description built at belt time is
// a description that can be weighed. So the same pass cut `read` and `bash` to
// their contract: `bash` gave up the routing sentence naming `propose_task`
// (which road work belongs on is `## Work or words`, and the manual's own "a job
// is the wrong door for work whose result is a deliverable"), and the arrival
// law's three copies — the sentence, the timeout sentence and the `background`
// argument — went to nought, on the strength of the page's new
// `handoff.reports-itself`. `write`'s append and salvage clause says the same
// two rules in 165 fewer bytes. Nothing was raised: the tool block went
// 24,044 → 23,392 on its own branch and the page is unmoved by this lane. The
// figure below is what it and lane F's pass weigh together, since both cut
// `read`.
// widestPage weighs the larger direct/deferred wording for each fact.
// AND THE QUICK TASK IS THE FIRST WAVE SINCE THIS FILE WAS WRITTEN THAT RAISED
// IT (2026-09-10), which is worth saying plainly rather than burying under the
// ledger above: every entry there paid for itself out of a sentence said twice,
// and this one could not, because it is not a sentence — it is a VERB the
// product did not have.
//
// `quick_task` encodes to 1,196 bytes and the belt's own bullet for it is 129
// more, and both were cut to the bone before this line moved. The description is
// the judge and nothing else — the six sentences that decide between a task, a
// quick task and doing the thing yourself (task_quick.go) — with the "the id
// returns at once, so never poll" sentence left off because [taskDescription]
// carries it and the two verbs are on a belt together or on neither. The schema
// is six fields whose descriptions are one clause each, and `depends_on` and
// `model` give up their rules entirely to `propose_task`'s copies of the same
// two fields. For comparison, `propose_task` encodes to 5,720.
//
// AND THE CHOICE WAVE PAID IT BACK THE NEXT DAY (2026-09-10), so the cap is
// 48,000 again and the measured prefix is 46,245, which is 1,755 under. Two
// things happened in one commit. The belt's hand-off section stopped being a
// list of bullets that sorted work by WIDTH and became one picture of what the
// model HAS and what each thing COSTS (beltfacts.go says why, and what a real
// model did with the list); the picture is a net saving on the three rule lists
// it replaced, and it states "never poll" once for every road rather than per
// verb. And `propose_task`'s schema went on the same diet its description went
// on: one clause per field, the dowry prose dropped from `brief` because
// prompts/system.md teaches it and a test pins it there, and the em dashes
// taken out of every description string, small models tokenising them badly.
// The tool block went 23,369 → 21,808 and the page reads 24,437.
//
// WHAT IS STILL OWED. The planner rule is in the prefix twice —
// `taskDescription`'s "do not reach for a planner" and prompts/system.md's own
// `THERE IS NO PLANNER ON YOUR BELT` paragraph — and both are pinned by
// TestTheBeltRoutesWideWorkToOneWorkerAndNotToAPlanner, so paying it back is a
// change to that test's mind and not only to the bytes.
// THE MEASUREMENT, AND NOTHING ON TOP OF IT. 53,141 bytes on 2026-09-12: the
// widest page at 19,114 and the fully-wired belt's tool block at 34,027 over
// twenty-three tools, weighed as the widest machine pays for it ([widestBelt]).
// There is no rounding in it and no headroom on it.

// prefixWaivers is what each arm is over its target by, dated, in ONE PLACE.
//
// ── THE RULE, WHICH IS `.github/known-red.txt`'S RULE ────────────────────────
//
// A waiver only ever SHRINKS. A lane that takes bytes out lowers the figure in
// the same commit; a lane that needs more takes it out of something that is
// already being said twice. Raising one is a decision with somebody's name on it
// in a diff, which is the entire difference between a debt and a floor.
//
// 2026-09-12, #996. The lean figure shrank from 13,489 to 13,420 in its own
// first commit, which is the discipline working rather than an edit: fixing the
// page's working directory and giving the lean arm its OWN shelf sentence took
// sixty-nine bytes off a number that had been measured on a hybrid. Both arms
// were weighing a conversation nobody has — no
// memory store, no accounts hub, no standing items, no saved programs — so both
// waivers are the first honest measurement of a prefix that had never been
// weighed, and neither is a wave's overspend. The bill is not spread thin:
// `stand` is 9,607 bytes, more than a quarter of the full tool block and, on a
// sixteen-thousand-token window, roughly one token in six of everything that
// person has before they have said anything.
//
// 2026-09-12, the merge with #1015. The prompt diet's read-dedupe wave added
// one sentence to the shared BELT_FACTS — the pointer that answers
// `[already read]` from the conversation rather than fetching the file again —
// and paid exactly 150 bytes on both arms doing it. Both waivers rise by that
// figure here, in this diff, on purpose: the rule says a raise is a decision
// with a name on it, and the alternative was cutting the sentence the merge
// just bought.
//
// 2026-09-16, #1065 round one. `# Tone` and `# Delivery` became `# The answer`,
// `# Answer or change`, `# When corrected` and `# Messages from codeaf`, in the
// wording the issue fixed and with the five rules the old two carried restored
// inside them, and that paid 2,035 bytes on both arms (fixed 53,276 to 55,311,
// lean 45,051 to 47,086). Fifteen of them came out of room both arms already had,
// so both waivers rise by 2,020 and now sit exactly on the measurement, on
// purpose and with this name on it: the issue that
// bought the sections is the one that puts the page's overall length to its
// second round, and cutting other laws in the first would be that round done
// early and unreviewed.
//
// 2026-09-20, the use_skill wave. A worker gained one verb it did not have:
// `use_skill`, which lists the active skill shelf and resolves one name to its
// shelf path (tools_skill.go), and the page gained the one belt-fact bullet that
// says the shelf is reachable (beltfacts.go). It is a NEW CAPABILITY rather than
// a second copy of a law — nothing on this belt already let a worker reach a
// saved procedure — so there was no sentence to take the bytes out of. It paid
// 741 bytes on the fixed arm (55,280 to 56,021) and 755 on the lean arm (47,055
// to 47,810), and both waivers rise by that figure here, in this diff, on
// purpose: the rule says a raise is a decision with a name on it, and the
// alternative was cutting the verb the wave exists to add.
//
// 2026-09-16, #1067 review. The provenance list had to grow because compaction
// also writes user-role tags into the conversation: `[folded …]` and `[context
// compacted]`. It also stopped calling the tool-only `[held]` a user message or
// declaring every unlisted tag the person's, and it does NOT name standing
// news's `[something you set up fired]`: that line carries its own instruction
// under the event, and TestTheSteeringLineReadsAsNewsAndNotAsARequest refuses
// the page's copy as one law paid for twice. Tightening the surrounding
// sentence paid for the truth with room to spare: fixed is 55,280 and lean is
// 47,055, so both waivers fall by 31 and again sit exactly on the measurement.
//
// 2026-09-20, the assisted-by trailer line. The commit-signing belt fact now
// spells the whole two-line trailer block — the co-author's ID-prefixed
// address, and above it the `Assisted-by` line naming the model, filled in at
// the render because the chat is the one surface that knows its model — and
// the widest page pays for it: fixed is 55,442, over its 55,280 by 162, so that
// waiver rises by 162. The lean shape's page never renders the attribution row
// and lean is 47,055 still, exactly on its measurement.
//
// 2026-09-21, the shelf-on-the-page wave. The page gained the three lines that
// say what a skill IS and when opening one beats improvising — nothing on the
// page had ever said that; the tool description said it only where the verb
// was on the belt. It is a NEW LAW rather than a second copy of one, so there
// was nothing to take the bytes out of; the use_skill description, its schema
// lines and the belt-fact row were tightened in the same commit and paid part
// of the bill. Fixed is 56,277, over by 94, and lean is 47,891, over by 81;
// both waivers rise by that figure here, in this diff, on purpose.
//
// 2026-09-23, #1393. The answer section got back the rule #1209's rewording had
// dropped without saying so — "done" is never half-solved work — and the same
// section paid for it by saying three things in fewer words. The page came out
// four bytes lighter on both arms: fixed is 56,273 and lean is 47,887, so both
// waivers fall by 4 and again sit exactly on the measurement.
//
// 2026-09-23, signing always on. The owner retired the `attribution` row:
// codeaf signs every commit it writes, and the only choice left is whether the
// `Assisted-by` line names the model. The law's commit sentence now spells both
// trailer lines itself, so the page's second sentence spelling the block again
// is gone: fixed is 56,146, and that waiver FALLS by 127. The lean arm RISES by
// 927, and that is not new wording: the shipped shape had the row unset, so this
// arm weighed a page with signing off, while every real conversation had it on
// by default and paid those bytes all along. The arm now weighs the page people
// were already reading, 48,814, and the raise carries this name so it can be
// questioned.
//
// 2026-09-23, the programs codeaf carries, and the owner's call by name. The
// hand-off page's programs paragraph (delegate_door.go) is each carried
// program's own guide, printed under its name, and codeaf's rule about the
// folder a program that edits files must be handed; `propose_task`'s `via`
// field points at `ground`. The paragraph was already on the shipped page
// and was never weighed: the shipping shape carried no programs, and
// [widestPage] weighed the frame without its fill. Both are fixed in the same
// change, and the true cost shows on both arms: fixed is 56,271, over its
// 55,442 by 829, and lean is 47,719, over its 47,055 by 664. Both waivers rise
// by exactly that and sit on the measurement. Paying it back out of other
// prompt text was offered and declined: the paragraph is how the conversation
// learns what senior-dev is for and which folder to hand it, and cutting
// other lanes' wording to make room was the riskier edit days before a ship.
//
// 2026-09-24, codeaf reaches for a program by itself, and the owner's call by
// name: "raise the cap only as much as necessary — the prompts will be refined
// later". The programs paragraph now says work a program is for goes to it
// whole, rather than to the conversation or its own worker whatever its
// critical path, and that work the person asks one for by name goes to it;
// senior-dev's guide claims the complex, many-sided coding work it was going
// unused on (an issue in a mature codebase whose cause spans files) and says
// its brief carries the issue in full; and `via` says when it is set. That
// grew fixed by 202 bytes (page 153, `propose_task` 49) to 56,447, and lean
// by 153 to 47,859. Both arms already had room, 26 and 13 bytes of it, so
// fixed rises by 176 and lean by 140, and both sit exactly on the
// measurement again.
//
// 2026-09-24, a program works in the folder itself. The folder rule stopped
// describing a copy nothing merges and says the folder and its branch instead
// ([delegateFolderRule]), 38 bytes shorter on both arms, and both waivers come
// down by exactly that: fixed measures 56,409 and lean 47,821.
//
// 2026-09-24, dev merged under senior-dev (#1488). Both ledgers above stand, and
// the waivers are measured again on the merged page: fixed is 57,124 and lean
// 49,590, which is dev's 56,146 and 48,814 plus what the senior-dev entries
// above added (978 and 776 bytes on this page). Both sit on the measurement.
//
// 2026-09-25, fixes A–E and the missing eight bytes. On this Linux machine the
// cap-setting commit itself, untouched 9abc11099, and this tree all weighed
// 57,132 and 49,598 before the guide edit: 22,299 + 34,833 on the full arm,
// 21,799 + 27,799 on the lean arm. The earlier 57,124 and 49,590 record was
// eight bytes short; changing HOME, USER, TMPDIR, TZ and the launch directory
// changed neither page nor tool block. Fix B's conditional `propose_task` `via`
// schema omits that field only on a door with no program. Fix D's longer
// `program-outcome.md` is read on a wake turn, not in the fixed page; its
// ceilings are rendered on a card and start line. Fixes A, C and E1 added no
// fixed-prefix bytes. The Unix program guide's two equivalent shorter phrases
// pay the eight bytes back, and a declared fixture now weighs that same guide
// and tool shape even on Windows, whose runnable registry is empty. The measured
// caps and both waivers therefore stay at 57,124 and 49,590, with no increase.
//
// 2026-09-25, #1494 and #1436 merged into #1488. Their team delegation and
// per-task crew forms leave the page at 22,291 bytes and grow the full tool
// block to 34,927 over 24 tools. The measured fixed prefix is 57,218 bytes:
// 94 above its preceding cap. The fixed waiver rises by exactly 94 for this
// combined belt; the lean arm remains within its 49,590-byte cap.
const (
	fixedPrefixWaiver = 9_218
	leanPrefixWaiver  = 18_090
)

// THE LEAN PROFILE GETS A BUDGET OF ITS OWN (2026-09-10, the prompt diet's lane
// G). promptprofile.go added a second shape of prefix for a model with a small
// window or the crew's open-weight worker seat: two sections come off the page,
// four more groups wait on the shelf, `ask` is handed over rather than fetched,
// the memory reflex does not run and the project's instruction file rides under
// 2 KiB. Nothing above it moved — the full arm renders byte for byte what it
// rendered before, which [TestAFrontierShapeIsUntouchedByTheProfile] asserts at
// every door — so this is a second number and not a raised one.
//
// WHAT IT MEASURES AND WHERE IT HAS TO GET TO. On a 16k window the lean prefix
// is what this test prints. On the profile's own branch it was 34,343 bytes
// against the full arm's 47,435; merged onto the rest of the diet — lane C's
// delete pass and routing table, lane D's self-describing messages, lane E's
// pulled mechanics, lane F's contract-only descriptions, lane B's window-scaled
// caps and the quick-task wave that took `fork` off the belt — it is 31,006
// against 38,742: page 16,825 plus tool block 14,181 over twelve tools.
//
// THE BELT IT WEIGHS IS THE SHAPE THE DESIGN ASKED FOR: the seven pi tools,
// `quick_task`, `jobs`, `manual`, `load_capability` and `ask`, with
// `propose_task`, `tasks`, `watch`, `track`, `commit`, `recall` and
// `read_document` one call away.
//
// The diet's target for this arm is 12,000 bytes
// (docs/design/prompt-diet/DESIGN.md §6) and nothing in this wave reaches it,
// which is worth saying plainly rather than rounding away. The two numbers that
// would move it were both named on landing: `ask`'s schema, and the page's
// 16,825, which is the shared CORE minus one section and so comes down when CORE
// does and not before.
//
// `ask` HAS NOW BEEN THROUGH, AND THE NUMBER CAME DOWN WITH IT (2026-09-10).
// It was 4,277 bytes of the tool block, thirty percent of the lean arm, because
// it is the one verb that is shelved on a full belt and PRE-ARMED on a lean one
// (promptprofile.go) — the schema a small model pays for on every request and a
// frontier model never sees. It is 3,844 now: no field left, no enum left, and
// what went was prose saying a field's own name back at the model (`"Block
// kind"` beside the list of block kinds, `"Subject kind"`, `"Turn waits"`,
// `"Certainty"` on a low/medium/high enum, and the same six repeated inside the
// evidence block, which is spliced into the schema TWICE) plus the tail of the
// two long ones. The lean prefix went 31,006 → 30,573, and the budget below went
// down with it rather than staying where it was: page 16,825 unchanged, tool
// block 14,181 → 13,748. The full arm is untouched at 38,742, byte for byte,
// which is what a shelved verb means.
//
// AND IT CARRIES A LITTLE HEADROOM, DELIBERATELY. Pinned to the exact
// measurement it was the one number in the tree that made the shared page
// unmovable: the routing-table commit added 226 bytes of CORE, which both arms
// read, and a lean budget with no slack failed a change the full budget waved
// through with thousands to spare. So the figure it LANDS at is about three
// percent over what it measured on landing — room for a few moves of that size,
// and not room for a paragraph.
//
// AND `ask` GREW AGAIN, WHICH THE HEADROOM ABSORBED AND THIS LINE SAYS OUT LOUD
// (2026-09-11, the questions wave). The schema's enums are now written from the
// Go constants rather than typed out beside them — so `pick.confidence` offers
// the three words the code actually reads, `input.blanks` and `input.dial` carry
// their shapes, and `subject.kind` carries `order`. That is four vocabularies and
// two objects the model could not see before, and it cost bytes: 3,844 → 4,235.
// 137 of them were won back the way the last pass won its 433, by deleting prose
// that says a field's own name back at the model (`"Comparison axis values, one
// short text per axis"`, `"What it holds before they type"`, `"kind blanks only"`)
// — leaving the schema at 4,098 and the lean prefix at 31,035 against the 31,500
// here, about 465 bytes of room.
//
// THAT IS THE HEADROOM DOING ITS JOB AND NOT A LICENCE. The paragraph above says
// what it is for: a few moves of a couple of hundred bytes, so a shared page can
// still move. A wave that needs more than this is a wave that takes something
// out first.
//
// THE HELD-RANGES WAVE PAID FOR THE ROUND-TRIP PRICE IT TEACHES (2026-09-12).
// The read tool's description says a call costs one round trip and a range
// already in the conversation answers as a pointer (bare/tools.go's
// [readDescription], the ledger in heldreads.go). The sentence was priced
// into the lean arm's headroom — 87 bytes came in, 9 came back out of the
// description's redundant "the rest", and the lean prefix sits 5 under its
// budget.
// THEREAFTER IT ONLY EVER RATCHETS DOWN, in the ledger discipline the full
// budget above is kept under: a lane that takes bytes out lowers it in the same
// commit, and nothing ever raises it again.
//
// ── AND THEN IT TURNED OUT TO BE WEIGHING A CONVERSATION NOBODY HAS ─────────
//
// Every figure above is real and every one of them was measured against
// [leanShapedAgent], which built a conversation with NO memory store, NO
// accounts hub, NO standing items and NO saved programs — sixteen tools. A
// person on a small window who has finished setting codeaf up carries `stand`
// (9,607 bytes by itself), `remember` and `search_conversations`, none of which
// [Config.leanCapabilityGroups] shelves, and their prefix is 44,989 bytes.
//
// So the arm that exists to protect the person with the LEAST room to spare was
// out by 13,489 bytes, which is more than the whole budget it was enforcing.
// That is #576's shape and it is the same hole the full arm above had, found in
// the same review: a gate pointed at something nobody runs passes without having
// tested anything, every day, in both directions.
//
// THE FIGURE IS THE MEASUREMENT NOW, with no headroom — the argument for slack
// was written when this number came off a diet that had just been paid for, and
// a number that has never been honestly weighed has not earned any. What the
// slack bought (a shared page that can still move by a couple of hundred bytes)
// is now bought by the full arm's 53,141, which both arms read the page through.
//
// WHAT IS OWED IS THE SAME BILL THE FULL ARM OWES, and it falls harder here:
// `stand` alone is 9,607 bytes on a sixteen-thousand-token window, which is
// roughly one token in six of everything that person has, spent before they have
// said anything. [leanPrefixTarget] is what this has to come back to and the
// test prints the shortfall on every green run.
