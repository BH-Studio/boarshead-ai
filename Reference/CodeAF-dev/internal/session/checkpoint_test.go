// THE FOURTH MOMENT: a turn priced while it is running, and READ BY SOMEBODY WHO
// IS NOT RUNNING IT.
//
// The three that existed before all decide with no evidence in front of them —
// the prompt's law, the route judge's read of a request, and a proposal the model
// remembers to make. This one reads the only thing that is a fact mid-turn: what
// the answer has cost so far, in finished tool rounds, against what handing it
// over costs — and then, at each mark, has a sidecar on the tier that thinks
// sketch what is actually left.
//
// So these tests pin the things that could quietly stop being true: that the
// meter fires at the marks and nowhere else, that the ask is the wording the
// benchmark chose and the shapes are read the way the benchmark scored them, that
// the running model is never sent a word of any of it, that a sketch with parts
// in it hands the turn over with the parts named and the road armed by a
// judgement, that a sketch saying "one job" costs the turn nothing at all, that
// every failure is a carry-on, that the ceiling still fires regardless, and that
// the turns which must never be checkpointed never are.

// things that are not tool rounds: the ceiling's one read, the dowry DRAFT at the
// end, the mastermind that writes the brief out of it, the namer — and THE STEPS
// THAT RIDE BESIDE THE READING. That last one is the sidecar's own arithmetic
// (sidecar.go): the drawing is started at the boundary that crosses the net and
// spent at the boundary after it LANDS, so a turn whose rounds cost nothing —
// which is every scripted turn — takes a few more of them in the gap. A script
// cut to the round count alone runs out under the sidecar, and the scripted
// completer's past-the-end answer would then be read as a sketch and as a brief.
//
// AND IT IS A PRICE'S WORTH BECAUSE THE GAP IS SCHEDULER-DEPENDENT. How many
// rounds pass between the net firing and its drawing landing is not fixed —
// nothing about the road promises a number — so a slack tight enough to fail
// once in four runs is a test asserting the scheduler. [checkpointPrice] is the
// unit this package already uses for "a turn's worth of work", and it is more
// than the gap has ever been measured at.

// HANDOVER BY SAYING IT WAS FINISHED and then carried on working.
//
// A believed claim is charged once and disproved by [checkpointPrice] more
// rounds of real work ([checkpointMeter.believeDone]), so a script that grinds
// longer than that price stops testing the ending it is about — the ceiling
// dropped over a turn nothing was left of — and starts testing the claim rung,
// which is a different law with its own test
// ([TestTheRunningModelsSayS0IsBelievedOnceAndThenMet]). A round short of
// the price is the whole of the reason for this number, and it is still longer
// than the sidecar gap [checkpointSlack] exists for has ever been measured at.

//
// THE NAMER IS NOT ONE OF THE TURN'S ROUNDS, so it must not spend one of the
// turn's steps. The ceiling's handover asks for a name the moment it decides to
// move the work, on a goroutine of its own and ahead of the two model calls that
// write the brief (checkpoint.go, taskname.go's [nameAhead]) — which is #333's
// design and is correct. What was wrong was here: this file scripted ONE
// positional queue, so on a machine with a spare processor the namer's call took
// whichever step the turn was about to take, and three tests failed about one run
// in five (#392).
//
// IT IS ANSWERED WITH AN EMPTY NAME, which is a namer that could not name — the
// one answer that changes nothing anywhere. [cleanTaskName] hands "" back,
// [Agent.launchRouteTask] adopts a landed name only when it is non-empty, and
// [TaskGraph.nameNode]'s fallback ask carries the same system line and so is
// answered off the queue too. So the row and the told-after line keep the
// person's own words, which is what every assertion on these pages was written
// against.
//
// A TEST THAT IS ABOUT THE DRAWING'S OWN REQUEST OPTS BACK OUT with
