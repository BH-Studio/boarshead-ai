// The worker's one verb for "the person changed what this is for".
//
// A direction arrives in the worker's next turn as an ordinary message, and
// almost all of them stay ordinary messages: "the config lives under etc/" is a
// fact the work needs, "why did you do it that way?" is a question to answer,
// and neither of them is a new contract. The one that IS a new contract — "CSV
// instead of JSON" — used to be unrepresentable: the worker could obey it and
// then be graded, by a checker reading the frozen acceptance, for having obeyed
// it. This verb is how that sentence becomes the thing the work is judged by.
//
// It is a tool rather than a reader because the alternative is a model call on
// every steer that decides whether a sentence was a direction, and a classifier
// that mistakes a question for an instruction rewrites a contract nobody asked to
// move. The worker's own turn already has the brief, the work and the words.
//
// WHAT IT CANNOT DO is mint authority. Each refusal below is one form of that:
// the direction must exist, must have come from the PERSON, may be spent once,
// must be newer than the one already in force, and must name the version this
// worker read. Nothing moves once a landing has taken the publication boundary.
// The admitted brief and acceptance stay on the spec, and the person's own words
// travel with the revision (assignment.go).
