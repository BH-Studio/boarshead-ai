// A SHARE OF THE WALL, AS TESTS (issue #546).
//
// The measured cell: an unattended run with a fifteen-minute wall whose turn read
// and ran tests inline for twelve and a half minutes, handed over with 147
// seconds left, and spent 60 of those opening the task's worktree. The two
// governors that could have moved it count ROUNDS and WRITES, and that turn
// crossed neither. So the clock is a third governor, and these are its laws:
//
//  1. under a steward with a wall, a turn past the share hands over;
//  2. under it, nothing happens and nothing is said;
//  3. a session somebody is sitting in front of is never bounded by it;
//  4. it opens its door ONCE in a turn, and only at a boundary the mark ladder
//     passed over.

// nothing, so the write seam never counts anything, and it is stopped at its
// first boundary, six rounds short of the first rung of the ladder. What moves it
// is the one fact neither of those can see — that a third of the run's clock has
// gone into this one answer — and what the person reads is this seam's own line.
