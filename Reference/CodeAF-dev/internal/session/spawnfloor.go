// THE SPAWN FLOOR: a trivial ask is answered in the conversation, and no door
// into the graph may convert it.
//
// THE MEASURED FAILURE (F16/F26). A person typed "commit everything with a
// sensible message". The chat staged the files, then the write seam said
// "this is changing more than a quick edit · moving it to a task" and spawned
// task 5. The commit never happened. A one-command ask was translated into a
// worktree, and the deliverable was dropped.
//
// The route judge already proved that reading the REQUEST cannot judge the
// work, and the checkpoint already reads the work. What neither had was a
// hard floor on the ASK itself: if the words are a single command or a
// known-trivial verb — commit, undo, a one-file or one-line edit, a single
// read — the turn stays here. The prompt already says small work is not
// work; a prompt is remembered exactly as often as the model remembers it,
// and F26 is the turn it forgot.
//
// SO THIS IS CODE, NOT ANOTHER SENTENCE IN A BRIEF. Every door that starts a
// task from a conversation — propose_task, the route judge, the checkpoint
// handover, the write seam that shares that handover — asks [trivialAsk]
// before it spends anything. A person who typed `/task commit everything`
// still gets a task: they asked for one. A genuine multi-part or multi-file
// ask is not in this set, and the other gates still convert it.
//
// A WRONG YES IS THE COSTLY DIRECTION. Refusing a real piece of work keeps
// it in the conversation, which is slower and still does it. Converting a
// commit is how the commit is lost. The matcher is a closed set and nothing
// else.

// spawnFloorRefusal is what propose_task reads back when the person's words

// refuseProposedTask is every check that can turn a propose_task call around
// BEFORE a card is raised or a slot is taken: the spawn floor where no program
// could lift it, a proposal that left out the program the person named, the
// floor again for a proposal that still leaves it out, then a depends_on that
// can never resolve. They used to live as endings of [Agent.proposeTask]; they
// are here so that road does not grow (the complexity ratchet holds it at 16).
//
// THE PROGRAM THE PERSON ASKED FOR LIFTS THE FLOOR. "fix this file with
// senior-dev" is a one-file fix on the floor's reading and an ask for a
// program on the person's: the proposal without `via` is turned back to name
// it, and the one that names it is not refused for being small
// (delegate_asked.go). A proposal naming a program the person did not ask
// for meets the floor as any proposal does.
//
// AND THE FLOOR COMES FIRST WHERE NOTHING COULD LIFT IT, so nothing there is
// pushed toward a program the floor would then refuse. A commit, an undo or a
// revert is never lifted: a program works on a branch of its own and never
// moves the person's, so "revert senior-dev's commit" handed to senior-dev is
// a billed run that cannot do the revert, which is F26 again. And a name said
// in passing ("fix senior-dev's typo in this file") asks nothing of the
// program, so only the words that ask for it lift anything
// ([Config.programsAskedIn]).
//
// IT ANSWERS A STAGED CALL, nil for none, because the bounce is not a settled
// refusal: it marks the message it was made for, and a call withdrawn before
// it went ahead takes that mark back ([askBounce.Withdraw]).
