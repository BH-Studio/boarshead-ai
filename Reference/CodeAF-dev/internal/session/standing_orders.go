// Standing orders: the session-side doors for the altitude work. This file is
// the seam between the engine lane and the surface lanes of the standing/v0
// wave (docs/STANDING-ORDERS.md), written by hand before the lanes started, in
// the shape standing_contract.go already proved.
//
// THE SIGNATURES ARE THE CONTRACT and the surface lanes code against them
// exactly as they stand. A door with nothing behind it answers the way it does
// when the ambient side is off — nothing, calmly — so a surface built against
// it draws nothing rather than an error.

//
// THE ORDER IS THE STORE'S AND NOT THIS FILE'S ([standing.Store.Applicable]).
// A second reading of which shelf an item sits on would be a second answer to
// the question every seam in this wave asks.

// footnote under shelves the page has already grouped by altitude, and a second
// ordering law for a dim line is a second thing that has to stay true.
