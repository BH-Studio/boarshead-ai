// GROOMING IS INFER-THEN-CONFIRM, NEVER INTERROGATE.
//
// PRD §4 states the law and the intake card is where it becomes visible: what
// the conversation already answers is IN the fields when the card comes up, and
// the only thing anybody is asked about is what is left. The failure this exists
// to prevent is the one every form-filling assistant falls into — a program that
// has just been told everything it needs asking for it again, field by field,
// while the person watches their own sentence being read back at them as
// questions.
//
// ONE MODEL CALL, AT MOST, AND ONLY WHEN THERE IS SOMETHING TO FILL. A program
// whose every field carries a schema default is answered without asking anybody,
// and a conversation that has said nothing yet is not worth a call to be told so.
// The call that does happen is on the cheap tier for the archetypal cheap-call
// reason: a wrong guess costs one correction on a card the person is already
// looking at.
//
// NOTHING HERE COMMITS ANYTHING. The card is the consent — the person reads what
// was inferred, changes what is wrong, fills what is missing, and confirms. A
// field this file filled and a field they typed are drawn differently
// ([SubharnessField.Filled]) precisely so that an inference can never be mistaken
// for something they said.
