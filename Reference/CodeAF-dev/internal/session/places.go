// WHERE A CONVERSATION IS ABOUT.
//
// place.go answers "where does this conversation keep things" and taskstands.go
// answers "where does this piece of work stand". This file answers the third
// question, which sat between them with nobody holding it: WHICH FOLDERS IS THIS
// CONVERSATION ABOUT?
//
// People open codeaf in general — one window, often from a home directory — and
// then work on things that live somewhere else. The window is where you sat
// down; the conversation is about places. There are two kinds and they are not
// the same thing:
//
//   - THE STANDING PLACE is [Config.Workspace]: the tools' cwd, the prompt's
//     working directory, the gate, the project config. It is captured at launch,
//     it is one, and nothing here moves it.
//   - REFERRED PLACES are the small ordered set below — the directories this
//     conversation has turned out to be about. They accrue from evidence and
//     never from configuration, and they are remembered on the session's own
//     meta.json so that a conversation reopened tomorrow still knows them.
//
// ── HOW ONE ARRIVES ──
//
// Two roads, and [PlaceArrival] is the whole of the difference between them:
//
//  1. THE PERSON NAMES IT ([Agent.ReferPlace] — the picker, a folder dropped on
//     the window, `/attach` on a directory). Somebody's own word, and it never
//     silently expires.
//  2. THE WORK RESOLVES IT ([Agent.keepGround]). When the ground ladder answers
//     at the TOUCHED rung, or the person settles the two-roots question and the
//     next proposal comes back naming their answer, that answer is written down
//     here — so the ladder's next climb finds it at SAID and NOBODY IS ASKED THE
//     SAME QUESTION TWICE. This is the whole anti-chore mechanism: you never
//     link anything; the conversation notices and remembers.
//
// ── AND IT IS EVIDENCE, NEVER A SECOND RESOLVER ──
//
// A referred place is a SAID answer fed into the one ladder taskstands.go owns
// ([Agent.groundFromPlaces]), and that is a ruling and not an implementation
// detail: [Agent.resolveTaskGround] stays the only place the ground is decided,
// so a task's ground is answered once, by one reading, whatever put the evidence
// in front of it.
//
// Nothing here widens where work may WRITE. One writable ground per node is
// taskoutside.go's law and it is untouched: referring a place tells the ladder
// what the conversation is about, and what the guard allows is still decided by
// the one ground a node stands on.
