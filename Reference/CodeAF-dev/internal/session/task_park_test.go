// THE PARENT THAT HANDED ITS WORK OUT, AND WHAT WAITING FOR IT COSTS.
//
// Every test here is written from ONE REAL RUN. A ten-issue job was split into
// three parts, all three were admitted before the parent's first request, and the
// parts really did work — ninety-four, two hundred and one, three hundred and
// fifty-nine seconds, four workers overlapping. The parent spent that window
// making thirty-one requests on a five second cadence about work it had already
// given away, and at 09:29:24 it announced `stopped: 6 steps without progress`
// and died — before its slowest part had finished. Nothing integrated. The batch
// did not finish.
//
// The counter was not wrong about what it saw. It was wrong about what it meant:
// a node between its parts' reports has nothing to write (the parts hold the
// work), nothing to learn (the answer is being made in three other worktrees) and
// no hand to reach for except the one that looks at what the parts are doing. Six
// of those and it read a parent doing the only thing available to it as a parent
// doing nothing.
//
// So the law these pin is one sentence: WAITING IS NOT WORKING, AND IT IS NOT
// SPINNING EITHER. A node with parts outstanding is parked — not asked, not
// counted, not clocked — and the turn that reads its reports reads all of them.

// The two tests above land their parts one at a time, against the parent's park,
// because landing them together used to race the delivery against the loop that
// reads it — and that race was a real defect and not a test premise. A delivery
// writes three things in a fixed order (the queue, the fact, the wake:
// [Agent.deliverTaskNote]) and the runner read two of them as two separate
// questions, owed first. A last part landing between those reads was seen as
// "nothing outstanding, one note owed": the parent took its integration turn
// carrying BOTH reports, correctly, and was then told about news that turn had
// already carried, so it came back for one more turn with an empty request.
// Measured as two byte-identical requests — a model turn's money, and a blank
// exchange in the room.
//
// THE LANDINGS ARE RELEASED FROM ONE CHANNEL, which is as close to the same
// instant as two goroutines get, and the run is repeated because what is being
// pinned is that no interleaving of the two deliveries can buy a second turn.
// The parent is on its park before either lands, so the only thing that varies
// between rounds is the order the two deliveries reach the runner in.
