package session

// THE CONVERSATION ABOVE A COMPACTION, AND WHY IT IS A SPLICE.
//
// A compacted session's own record of what it had said stopped at the marker.
// The journal held every original line above it and nothing could reach them, so
// a surface scrolling back read the pass's shortened copy — stubs where the tool
// output was, one line where a long run of work had been — and had no way to ask
// for the words themselves.
//
// The correction is NOT "there is more conversation above the marker". The pass
// re-journals its whole rebuilt window BELOW the marker, so the same
// conversation is in the file twice: once as it happened, above, and once
// rewritten, below. [EarlierHistory] is therefore a region AND a floor, and the
// conversation told once is `Entries` followed by `Transcript()[Floor:]`.
//
// What is asserted here: the region is taken with the reducer's own state (a
// rewind before the marker stays taken back), the floor comes from the file
// rather than from a guess, and a file that does not carry the floor is offered
// no region at all rather than a doubled conversation.
