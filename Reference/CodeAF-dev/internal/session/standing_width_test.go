package session

// WIDTH, WHERE NOBODY IS WATCHING.
//
// A standing order that fires at 2am and starts work is the one road on which
// "this is wider than one pair of hands" could not be said: the run had no
// graph, so its session had no way to hand anything out and no verb to do it
// with. These drive the REAL standing-run road — [standingRunner.Run], the
// config it builds, the belt that config makes and the tool the model actually
// calls — because the whole of this fix is that a firing joins the road every
// other piece of work is already on rather than getting a second one.
