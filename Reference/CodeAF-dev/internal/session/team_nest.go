// ── NESTED TEAMS: SUB-TEAMS, CONFLICTS, ONE LEVEL, AND THE GLOBAL MANAGER ────
//
// The rulings (c-5, c-6, c-7; docs/design/conversations-and-teams/DESIGN.md,
// section 8): work is handed down a tree of teams and decisions travel up it.
// This file is the session's half of the tree:
//
//   - A SUB-TEAM IS STARTED LIKE A MEMBER. `team_start` of kind team makes the
//     child team in the store under the manager's team (refused past the
//     effective depth limit or under a closed team, with the reason), writes
//     its share of the pool on it ([teams.File.SubTeamCap]), moves in the
//     members it names, and writes ONE start to the parent's Traffic, the start
//     the interface already carries out: it opens the new conversation behind
//     the one in front and adds it to the parent team under its handle. The
//     start names the child ([teams.Entry.Team]), and the new conversation,
//     reading its brief at its first boundary, makes itself the child's manager
//     ([Agent.claimSubTeams]). So its manager is a member of the parent and
//     reports up by the ordinary home rule, and the interface needs nothing new.
//   - A CONFLICT IS DECLARED, NEVER DETECTED. `team_raise` names the other
//     parties by handle (across teams as `team/@handle`), finds the lowest
//     common managed ancestor of all of them ([teams.File.LCA]), and raises a
//     conflict packet there, or to the person when there is none. That manager
//     is woken by the packet line and handed the packet whole; it decides with
//     `team_decide` or sends it up with `team_escalate`, never sideways; and the
//     store turns the decision into a directive to every party in its own team's
//     log ([teams.IsRuling]), which wakes it.
//   - ORDERS GO ONE LEVEL DOWN. A manager's directive and stop reach its own
//     team's members, a sub-team's manager among them, and never a sub-team's
//     members: a handle that names one is refused with the sentence that points
//     to that sub-team's manager ([subTeamPointer]).
//   - THE GLOBAL MANAGER is the manager of the root team (teams' root.go). The
//     store seats every top-level manager as a member of the root, so its
//     verbs, its delivery and its members' homes are the ordinary ones; its view
//     of its team is only those managers ([managedView]), never their chats.
//   - A SUB-TEAM WITH NO MANAGER OF ITS OWN answers to the nearest manager above
//     it for questions and for `team_post` to the manager ([bossOf]); orders do
//     not reach it, because its members are not that manager's members.
