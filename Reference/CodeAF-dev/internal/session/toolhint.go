// FORMING CALLS — the phase between "nothing" and "the model has asked".
//
// A tool call arrives over the wire in fragments, and for a long one — a write
// whose body is the file, a propose_task whose brief is three paragraphs — the
// arrival takes seconds. Until this existed the turn said nothing for those
// seconds: EventToolAnnounced fires when the call is WHOLE, and a surface
// waiting on it draws silence while the model is visibly working.
//
// This file is what stands in that gap. It takes the provider's per-fragment
// StreamToolCallForming events (provider/stream.go) and answers two questions
// the read loop deliberately does not: HOW OFTEN a person needs to be told, and
// WHAT to say. Both answers are best-effort by construction — the text being
// described is half a JSON object — and neither may ever fail: a scan that
// panicked or a hint that errored would take down a turn to decorate a row.

// formingInterval is the fastest a single forming call may speak. The provider
// raises one event per fragment, which for an endpoint streaming arguments a
// token at a time is hundreds a second — every one of them fanned out to every
// subscriber's queue and drawn by every surface.
//
// Ten frames a second is already faster than a person reads a growing byte
// count, and the two things that are NOT time-based — the name landing, and an
// argument field closing — bypass it entirely, because those are the moments the
// row actually changes what it says.

// a SUBSTRING of it, which in Go shares the backing array — so a tighter cap
// never freed a byte, it only decided how much of an already-resident string a

// had exactly two options — a second tolerant parser of its own, or this. The
// scanner below already handles the two cases that make a prefix hard: a string
// that has no closing quote yet, and a text that ends in the middle of an escape
// (`\` alone, or three of the four hex digits of a `\u`), both of which simply
// contribute nothing until the rest of them lands.
//
// What comes back is the DECODED value — `\n` is a newline here — capped at
