// turnhandoff.go answers TWO questions for the end of a turn, both facts about
// the graph rather than readings of anything the model said:
//
//	 1. did this turn put the work THE CURRENT REQUEST asked for into a task that
//	    is still live? ([turnHandedItsAskOff])
//	 2. is this turn answering a request whose work has already come home with
//	    its check green? ([turnSettledItsAsk])
//
// They are the two halves of one moment. The first stops the reader polling a
// task that is about to report. The second stops it re-opening a report that
// already landed done.

// ── THE LIVE HALF ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// THE MEASURED FAILURE.
//
// "Please hand this work to a task: run ./slow-build.sh, wait for it to finish,
// and tell me the marker it wrote. Start it now; keep the main conversation
// available while it runs." The turn proposed the task, said it was started and
// that the conversation stayed free, and stopped — which is the whole of what
// was asked for. The end-of-turn reader was then asked whether the ASK was
// finished, answered no (the marker is not known yet, because the build is
// running), and the turn was re-opened with [checkpointCarryOnNote]. The model,
// with nothing left to do, polled `tasks` and started a watch over its own
// running task.
//
// THE TURN WAS FINISHED AND THE OUTCOME WAS NOT. The reader only ever answers
// the second, and a live node is what makes the difference safe: its landing
// starts a turn here by itself ([Agent.reportTaskNode], [Agent.deliverTaskNote])
// and THAT turn is read for what remains, at wake prices, with the report in
// front of it.
//
// ── THE GUARANTEE, EXACTLY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The live gate opens only when ALL of these hold:
//
//	 1. this agent is a conversation, not a task worker ([Config.InTask]);
//	 2. a turn is running, and the node was admitted BY THIS AGENT DURING IT
//	    ([TaskGraph.admit] stamps every node it takes, whichever door opened it);
//	 3. the person has said nothing since that admission — same turn number AND
//	    same steer number ([requestEpoch]);
//	 4. that node is queued or running.
//
// ── AND WHAT IT DOES NOT CLAIM ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// IT IS AN OWNERSHIP SIGNAL, NOT A COMPLETION PROOF. It says the request's work
// has an owner that will report; it does not say every clause of the request was
// delegated. A turn that hands one part off and quietly drops another ends here
// too, and what catches that is the woken turn's own reading when the part
// lands, not this gate. Nothing is marked done, no acceptance is answered, and
// the goal reading is deferred rather than skipped.
//
// QUEUED OR RUNNING IS WHAT THE GRAPH KNOWS, AND IT IS NOT A LIVENESS PROOF. A
// node held behind a slot, the machine governor or a dependency stays queued for
// as long as that lasts, and a running node that has stopped making progress
// still reads as running; this file invents no further state to pretend
// otherwise. What bounds both is the graph's own machinery — the frontier, the
// step and no-progress caps, the deadline — every one of which ends the node and
// wakes this session with the news.

// requestEpoch is WHICH REQUEST a turn is working on, as two numbers the runtime
// already keeps: the turn ([Agent.turnSeq]) and the sentences the person has
// spliced into it ([Agent.steerSeq], minted by [Agent.Steer]).
//
// THE STEER HALF IS WHAT MAKES IT A REQUEST AND NOT A TURN. A steer does not
// start a new turn — it lands at the next boundary of the running one — so a
// turn number alone would let work handed out before a correction stand as the
// answer to the correction. A person who typed anything at all since the
// handoff moves this number, and the turn is read as it would have been.
type requestEpoch struct {
	turn  uint64
	steer uint64

// live says an epoch names a request at all. The zero epoch is "no turn was
// running", which is what work opened between turns carries.

//

// is owed a reading of THAT ask. But a turn nobody typed is a different animal.
//
// ── THE MEASURED FAILURE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// 2026-09-10, 16:19, deepseek-v4.1-flash. A chat started two quick tasks in one
// batch and ended its turn saying they would land on their own. The first landed
// at 19:22, its note woke a turn, and the chat answered it. That woken turn
// stopped — correctly, with nothing to do until the second task returned — and
// the carry-on road read it, was told the second task had not come back, and
// re-opened it. Three times, at 19:51, 20:05 and 20:11, each one a reader call
// and a `tasks` poll of the very node that was about to report, each one
// answered "still running, no gap to fix", until [checkpointCarryOnCap] stopped
// it. The same fired in a second drive over a task that was landing in the same
// second.
//
// So the gate is the one above with the epoch taken out and the PERSON put in
// its place: work this conversation started, still queued or running, and
// nothing of the person's own in the turn that is ending.
//
// ── THE PERSON VETOES AND NOTHING ELSE DOES ─────────────────────────────────
//
// It is [Agent.deliveringOwnedResult]'s rule, for its reason. A landing, a job
// exiting, a watch firing are the session talking to itself; the ask they are
// answering is the one the work was started under, and its ending is already on
// its way. A sentence the PERSON typed or steered in is a new request, is owed a
// reading of its own, and takes this gate away — which is what keeps the three
// cases below (an old task, a handoff before their next sentence) answering
// exactly as they did.

// turnIsWaitingOnItsOwnTasks reports that this conversation has a task of its
// own — quick or ordinary, from this turn or any earlier one — that is still
// queued or running, in a turn the person has said nothing in. It names the
// first such node so the journal can say which ending the turn is waiting for.
func (a *Agent) turnIsWaitingOnItsOwnTasks() (uint64, bool) {
	// A NODE'S OWN TURN IS NEVER GATED, for [Agent.turnHandedItsAskOff]'s

// they are the same agent. A node rehydrated from a checkpoint has neither and

// ── THE SETTLED HALF ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// turnSettledItsAsk says this turn is answering a request whose work has already
// come home with its check green, so the end-of-turn reader must not re-open it
// as unfinished.
//
// THE MEASURED FAILURE. A task landed done, its own checks passed, the card
// showed the settled mark, and the end-of-turn reader — looking at a digest of
// the transcript, not the tree — said the ask was unfinished. The turn was
// carried on three times and then told the person the work was not finished
// (#468). The live-task gate ([turnHandedItsAskOff]) covers the other half of
// the same moment: work still out. This is the landing's half.
//
// THE GATE OPENS ONLY WHEN ALL OF THESE HOLD, and each is a runtime fact:
//
//  1. this agent is a conversation, not a task worker;
//  2. this turn arrived with at least one result ([Agent.turnResults]);
//  3. every ask it owes came from those results — not the person's own later
//     words, which would be a new request on top of the landing
//     ([wakecause.go]);
//  4. every arrived node is done, and its own check passed.
//
// A PIECE OF A LARGER ASK IS NOT THIS. A landing whose tag carries no request
// leaves the turn owing the person's broader sentence, and that turn is still
// read — TestAWokenTurnThatStopsShortIsReopenedEvenWhenCheap is that shape. A
// failed landing is news to carry on from, and a done landing nobody checked is
// still read: the green mark on the card is the check that ran, and without it
// the reader is the second opinion the work has.
