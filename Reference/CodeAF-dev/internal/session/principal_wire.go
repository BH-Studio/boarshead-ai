package session

// WIRING THE PRINCIPAL INTO ONE SESSION.
//
// principal.go says what a principal IS and what the two of them answer. This
// file is the seam: which one a session gets, what it is told, and the three
// small readings the roads that consult it are built out of.
//
// THE FIELD IS WRITTEN ONCE AND NEVER AGAIN ([newPrincipalFor], called from
// [newAgent]), which is what lets every road read `a.principal` without the
// session lock. A principal that could be swapped mid-session would be a
// session whose acceptance and budget mean different things at different
// moments, and there is no door in this build that wants one.

// principalEar is the half of a principal that is TOLD things rather than
// asked. It is unexported and off the interface on purpose: [Principal] is what
// the roads consult, and being informed of the person's own words is this
// package's business with the two implementations it built.
type principalEar interface{ hear(ask string) }

// newPrincipalFor picks this session's principal, and THE BUDGET IS WHAT PICKS
// IT — unless somebody is steering.
//
// Four readings, in order, and each of the first three is a reason a session
// stays exactly as it was:
//
//   - A CONVERSATION SOMEBODY IS STEERING GETS A [Person], whatever its
//     approval posture and whatever ceilings were typed beside it. `--yolo` is
//     the approval posture and a budget is the goal owner's ceiling, and for a
//     screen somebody is typing into neither one is a fact about who is
//     watching — [Config.Interactive] is, and only the door knows it.
//   - A SESSION NOBODY CONFIGURED GETS A [Person] too, which is every worker
//     and every agent a test assembled by hand.
//   - AN UNATTENDED SESSION WITH NO CEILING ALSO GETS A [Person], and the door
//     says one line about it at launch. This is the rule the whole feature turns
//     on: carrying a conversation on by itself is spending, and spending
//     unasked-for money on an unstated ceiling is not something a flag about
//     TOOL APPROVALS may be read as permission for.
//   - AND AN UNATTENDED SESSION WITH ONE GETS A [Steward].
//
// The spend closure reads the session's own journaled figure under its own
// lock, which is the figure rail.go bounds against — one ledger, two rails.
