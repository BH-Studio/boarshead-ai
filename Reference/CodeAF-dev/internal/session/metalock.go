// The lock over one conversation folder's identity file.
//
// meta.json is replaced atomically, so every reader sees a whole identity, but
// replacing the file does not make the read before it part of the same act. A
// title stamp and a spend stamp can both read the old identity, change their own
// field, and then each rename a complete file over the other. An Agent mutex
// closed that hole for one window and left it open for a second Agent and every
// second process on the same conversation.
//
// The serialization belongs to the FOLDER, not to an Agent. A process-local
// per-directory mutex is the cheap first gate for this process's goroutines,
// and a file lock beside the identity makes every process meet on the same
// inode before any of them reads it.

//
// It never gives an entry back, which is the right trade at this size: one

// wait all run the transaction unlocked. That is exactly what these stamps did
// before this lock existed, and placemeta.go's EVERY FAILURE IS SILENCE law
// makes a best-effort citation better than a refused conversation.
