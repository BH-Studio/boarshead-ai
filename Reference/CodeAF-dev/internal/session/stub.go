package session

// Tool-output stubs: the old, heavy results in the LIVE context are replaced by
// a line saying how big they were and where the bytes are.
//
// The problem is specific and it is not compaction's. A session reads a 200KB
// file on its first turn and re-sends those 200KB on every request of every turn
// afterwards, for hours, to answer questions that have nothing to do with it.
// Compaction eventually summarizes the whole prefix away — lossily, and only
// once the window is nearly full. This is the cheaper move made much earlier:
// the result the model has already used is turned into a pointer to itself.
//
// ── STUB, DON'T DELETE ──
//
// The full bytes are written to a stubs/<hash>.txt of the session's own
// (landing.go) BEFORE the message is replaced, and the stub line names that
// path. A model
// told where the bytes live can read them back with the tool it already has, so
// a stub costs a call when the old output turns out to matter and costs nothing
// the rest of the time. Deleting the text instead would be the one version of
// this that loses work.
//
// ── THE JOURNAL IS NEVER STUBBED ──
//
// Only a.messages — the live context — is rewritten. The session file keeps the
// result it recorded, whole, because the journal is the RECORD: it is what a
// resume replays, what a person reads back tomorrow, and what a surface expands
// a tool row from. A record that quietly shrank the day after it was written
// would be a different kind of file than the one this session promises.
//
// ── AND THE ESTIMATE FOLLOWS FOR FREE ──
//
// messageBytes (loop.go) counts the text that is actually in the transcript, so
// a stubbed result weighs its stub line the moment it is replaced. The
// compaction estimate, the threshold check and the surface's context meter all
// read that same figure — nothing here has to tell them anything, and the
// pressure that would have fired a compaction pass is simply gone.

	// REWRITING A MESSAGE IN PLACE MAKES EVERY BYTE AFTER IT COLD. A prompt
	// cache is keyed on the exact leading bytes of a request (internal/provider's
	// caching.go), so replacing a result half-way down the transcript does not
	// shrink the request by the difference — it re-prices the whole tail behind
	// it at the uncached rate on the very next call. The arithmetic that
	// followed: a cache-served prompt token is about a fifth of a fresh one on
	// the published prices, so a pass that turns C bytes cold to save S bytes
	// costs about 4C once and returns S on each later request, and it has not
	// paid for itself until roughly 4C/S of them have gone by. An eighth is that
	// break-even set at about thirty requests — a handful of tool rounds, well
	// inside one working conversation. A FIFTH IS THE CONSERVATIVE END of what
	// endpoints actually charge: a shallower discount makes the re-send cheaper
	// relative to the saving and so makes a pass pay sooner, never later.
	//
	// It is a SHARE and not a byte count because both halves move: the same
	// 2KB result is obviously worth stubbing out of a small transcript and
	// obviously not worth disturbing a hundred-thousand-token one for. Below the
	// share nothing is written and nothing is replaced; the candidates are simply
	// looked at again at the end of the next turn, by which time they are usually
	// part of a batch that clears it.

// stubOldOutputs replaces the heavy tool results of older turns with pointers to
// their own bytes. It is called at the end of a COMPLETED turn, before the
// compaction check, so the check sees the transcript as it will actually be
// sent — AND AGAIN as the first pass of a compaction (loop.go), which is why the
// work itself lives in [Agent.stubOldOutputsLocked].
//
// A turn that was interrupted or that failed is left alone, and nothing is lost
// by that: the pass is idempotent and the next completed turn catches up. The
// reason is the moment rather than the mechanism — an interrupted turn is one
// the person is about to read, rewind or retry, and rewriting their context
// underneath them on the way out is work done at the one moment nobody asked for
// any.
//
// Everything it cannot do, it declines silently and completely: a session with
// no workspace, a directory it cannot write, a result it cannot file. A stub
// whose bytes did not reach disk is never written, because the one thing this
// must never do is turn a result into a path to nothing.
//
// The whole pass runs under a.mu, including the file writes. It is a lock held
// across I/O, which this package otherwise refuses to do — the exception is
// deliberate and bounded: the alternative is to release the lock between reading
// the messages and replacing them, and a compaction pass entering that window
// rebuilds the slice, so the indices would then name different messages. The
