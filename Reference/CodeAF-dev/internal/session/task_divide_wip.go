// A FAMILY THAT DIVIDES COMMITS ITS WORK FIRST, AND THAT COMMIT IS THE ONE WORLD
// EVERY PART OF IT STARTS FROM.
//
// ── WHAT THIS REPAIRS, AND IT IS TWO THINGS ──
//
// FIRST, THE PARTS COULD NOT SEE THE PARENT'S WORK. Workers are told never to
// commit — `write` and `edit` put files on disk and the harness commits them,
// once, at the landing (task_run.go's [commitTaskWork]). That is right for a
// task that runs alone and wrong the moment one divides mid-run: everything the
// parent has written by then — a repro it built, a failing test it wrote, the
// material it gathered, the half-drafted section a part is meant to continue —
// is uncommitted work in a directory the parts are about to branch off. The
// parent's briefs can DESCRIBE those findings; nothing handed over the artefacts
// themselves, and for a part that has to RUN the failing test that is the job.
//
// SECOND, THE SIBLINGS DID NOT EVEN SEE THE SAME WORLD AS EACH OTHER. A part's
// working copy is prepared lazily, when the frontier starts it, and a parent
// goes on working while its parts run (the parent-stays law). So two parts cut a
// minute apart each inherited whatever the parent's directory happened to hold
// at that instant, and the division that drew their boundaries had described
// neither of those worlds.
//
// One commit answers both. Before a single part is admitted, the harness stages
// the parent's ledger and commits it onto the family branch, and the commit the
// family tree then stands at is written onto every part as it is admitted. The
// harness commits, never the worker, so "you never run `git add`" stays as true
// as it was.
//
// ── WHY A COMMIT AND NOT THE GROUND LADDER'S SEAL ──
//
// This is worth answering out loud, because the ground ladder already carries a
// parent's uncommitted world to a child: the snapshot rung writes a machine
// commit of the parent's tree and carves the child's worktree from it
// (groundladder.go's [sealGroundWork]), and the landing rebases it back out
// ([taskTree.replayOwnWork]). From far enough away the two look like one job
// done twice.
//
// THEY ARE DIFFERENT ANSWERS TO DIFFERENT QUESTIONS.
//
//   - The seal answers WHAT WORLD DOES THIS ONE CHILD STAND IN. It is
//     scaffolding: written with `commit-tree`, which moves no ref at all, so it
//     belongs to no branch and is reachable only from the child it was made for
//     — and it is deliberately lifted out again at that child's landing, so that
//     what comes home is the child's own work and not its inheritance.
//   - This commit answers WHAT DOES THE FAMILY'S TREE HOLD. It is history: on
//     the family branch, made once, and it stays. The parent's work comes home
//     with the family's, inside the one merge the person sees.
//
// Leaving the second job to the seal would mean a family whose shared material
// exists only inside each part's private branch, in a commit the landing is
// written to discard, made once per part off whatever the parent's directory
// held at that moment. That is not a family tree; it is one copy per part and no
// record of any of them. A `git log` of the family branch would show none of it,
// and a crash between the division and the landing would leave the parent's work
// in an object nothing references.
//
// SO THERE IS ONE ROAD AND THIS IS THE HEAD OF IT. Because the commit is on the
// branch, a part is carved straight from it and the seal is not asked at all
// (groundladder.go's [snapshotRung]) — which also means there is no `base` to
// rebase out, so a part's landing is an ordinary merge onto a shared ancestor
// and one failure mode fewer. The seal keeps its own job, unchanged, for every
// task that is nobody's part.
//
// ── THE GUARDS, AND WHY EACH IS THERE ──
//
//   - THE HARNESS MAY ONLY COMMIT IN A TREE OF ITS OWN. A family told to work
//     `here` — in place, or a folder with nowhere else to stand — works in the
//     person's own directory, and a commit there would be machinery writing onto
//     the branch they are sitting on. That is the one thing this must never do,
//     so it is asked structurally rather than by listing modes
//     ([harnessOwnsThisTree]). A family with no tree of its own freezes nothing
//     and its parts go on sharing the parent's directory, which is what "here"
//     already meant.
//   - NOTHING WRITTEN, NOTHING COMMITTED — but the world is still pinned. An
//     empty ledger is the emptiness law and the whole of the sketch road's
//     answer: a division drawn before the first request has nothing on disk to
//     commit. THE FREEZE IS STILL TAKEN, at the family tree's HEAD as it stands,
//     because the second defect above does not need the parent to have written
//     anything — a parent that writes AFTER the division would otherwise reach
//     the parts that start late and not the ones that started early.
//
// ── AND A FREEZE THAT WOULD NOT GO REFUSES THE DIVISION ──
//
// This is the one road here that answers anybody, and it is loud because the
// alternative is the defect. A family tree that cannot be committed to, or
// cannot say where its HEAD is, is a family whose parts would be admitted onto a
// world nobody chose — the exact silence this file exists to end. So nothing is
// handed out, the worker is told in one line, and it carries on with the work in
// its own hands, which is what every other refusal on this road leaves it doing.

// without the parts carrying it is a fact nobody reads. Both halves are here, in
