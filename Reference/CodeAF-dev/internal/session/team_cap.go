// ── A TEAM'S DAILY CAP IS HELD, NEVER CUT MID-TURN ──────────────────────────
//
// A team may have a daily cap (teams' teamsettings.go, `cap_usd_day`, which
// inherits), and a cap is a POOL: its owner's spend counts every team under
// it. A profile default is each ordinary team's own pool; the global manager
// group has no default cap, and an explicit ancestor cap remains that
// ancestor's pool ([teams.Effective]'s CapFrom). This file is what enforces
// it, on the session's side, and what it enforces is deliberately small:
//
//   - AT OR OVER THE CAP, WHAT THE TEAM WOULD START IS HELD. A wake (a
//     directive to a member, replies to a manager, an answer to a question), a
//     new member's first turn on its brief, and `team_start` are refused while
//     the pool is at its cap. A turn already running is never cut: it finishes
//     and nothing new starts behind it. The lines that were held are not
//     lost; they are delivered at the conversation's next turn.
//   - THE PERSON'S OWN WORDS ARE NOT HELD. A person typing into a member's
//     conversation spends their own money in front of them, which is not what
//     a cap on unattended work is for.
//   - ONE CAP PACKET PER POOL AND CEILING goes to the person ([teams.Person]):
//     `harbor reached its $5 cap today`, with `Raise to $10` and `Stop for
//     today`, and a recommendation. Whoever meets the cap first raises it;
//     everyone after finds it waiting and raises nothing, including a second
//     process: [teams.Raise] keeps one packet per pool, day and ceiling under
//     the decisions file's lock. A raise lifts the
//     ceiling for the rest of that local day to the figure the option said
//     ([teams.CapFacts].RaiseTo); a stop, or an answer in the person's own
//     words, holds the pool until the day turns or the cap is changed.
//   - A MANAGER NEVER RAISES A CAP. The packet waits on the person, and
//     `team_decide` refuses a cap packet in words.
//
// IT IS NEVER A HOT-PATH LEDGER SCAN. The check runs only where the team would
// start something (a wake, a start), never per model request, and the spend
// it reads is kept against [teams.TeamSpendStamp] (a stat of the teams file
// and one of the ledger): a pool whose stamp has not moved is answered from
// memory, and one that moved is read by teams' own incremental fold.
