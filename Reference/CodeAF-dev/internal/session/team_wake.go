// ── A MEMBER THE MANAGER STARTED TAKES ITS FIRST TURN ON ITS OWN ────────────
//
// `team_start` writes a start to the team's Traffic, and the interface that
// holds the manager answers it by opening a new conversation BEHIND the one in
// front and putting it in the team under the manager's handle for it
// (internal/tui3's teamtraffic.go). Nobody types into that conversation: the
// person's words are theirs, and a brief sent as if they had typed it would
// outrank the manager and draw as the person's own line. So the brief has to
// reach the member by the one road the manager's words take, the Traffic
// delivery at a step boundary ([Agent.teamBoundary]), and there has to be a
// turn for that boundary to be in.
//
// THIS IS THAT TURN, and nothing else starts it. The interface and the session
// meet only through internal/teams, and over a session host the interface holds
// a client with no door for "start a turn with no words" (internal/remote). So
// the conversation watches for its own start: for a short window after it
// opens, and only on a profile where some team has a manager, it looks at the
// teams file (a stat, and a read only when the stat moved) until it finds
// itself a member with a handle and a start addressed to that handle. Then it
// reads what is addressed to it exactly as a boundary would, and if that is not
// empty it queues it as a note that wakes the conversation ([Agent.wakeLocked]).
// The watch ends at the first of: the wake, a turn begun some other way, the
// window running out, or the session closing.
//
// A TEAM WHOSE AUTO-WAKE IS OFF IS THE EXCEPTION. The member is still opened,
// and the brief is still waiting in the Traffic for its first turn, but no
// turn is started for it. The Traffic says so, in the same voice as a wake
// that could not run.
//
// A conversation that is never started by a manager pays one stat of the teams
// file at open and, where a team has a manager, one stat every
// [teamWakeEvery] for [teamWakeFor].
