// ── WHY IT IS A CLOCK AND NOT A COUNT ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// It used to hand the agent `Limits{TransportAttempts: n}` and a one-millisecond
// wait: the ladder was bounded by a number, so shortening the schedule in front
// of it was enough. The number is gone (docs/design/recovery/DESIGN.md §4) and
// the bound is the deadline — so a wait that returns at once does not shorten
// the ladder, it makes the deadline UNREACHABLE, which is the same fiction
// internal/provider's own scenarios keep honestly (`owed` in dispatch.go).
//
// So the wait moves the clock instead of sleeping on it. The product's real
// schedule — [retryBaseDelay] doubling — then spends the real give-up in real
// arithmetic and no real time, and `attempts` is what the caller wants that to
// come to: the first wait is sized so the deadline lands after exactly that many
// requests.
// turnLadderAttempts is how many requests these scenarios give one model before
// its deadline is gone. THREE, which is exactly what the shipped build did when
// the ladder was a count — so every assertion below still describes the budget a
// person actually gets, and describes it as a length of time rather than as a

	// never made.
	//
	// A LADDER WHOSE FIRST MOVE IS FREE GETS ONE MORE, and that is not a fudge —
