// THE MEDIA VERBS TRAVEL, and this file is what says so on every surface that
// carries a belt.
//
// The conversation had them and nothing else reliably did. A task node was
// handed the client and the resolver and then had its media verbs taken away at
// the one moment it was ordered to produce; a saved harness was told in writing
// that image generation was "something a conversation reaches for" and its lint
// refused the whitelist. Each of those was invisible in exactly the same way: the
// verb was simply absent, and an absent verb is indistinguishable from a machine
// with no model for it.
//
// So each surface is pinned twice — carries them when a model exists, lacks them
// when it does not — because a test that only asserted presence would pass just
// as happily on a belt that had stopped obeying the absence law.
