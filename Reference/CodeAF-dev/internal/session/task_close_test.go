// A CLOSED SESSION HAS NO RUNNING NODES.
//
// The quit used to reach nodes through one door, the jobs round, which walks a
// registry a node only puts itself in from INSIDE its own goroutine. A node
// admitted in the last moments of a session was therefore invisible to the quit
// for as long as that goroutine took to be scheduled, and what it did next was
// run — a log opened under a session that had left, two model calls of real
// spend, and nothing a person could stop or find (issue #381).
//
// So this admits a node whose body does nothing but wait to be cut, closes the
// session, and asks the two questions the law is made of: was the node cut, and
// had its goroutine returned before Close did.
