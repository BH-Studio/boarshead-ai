// A hand the harness took away, and the four things that must be true about it.
//
// EVERY TEST HERE IS ONE RUN. SWE-Marathon s4, task 1, 00:37Z–00:40Z: a worker
// building a Java language server in Rust was landed by the no-progress ratchet,
// had `bash`, `read` and `grep` taken off its belt by the landing pass, and was
// answered "Unknown tool: bash" — eighteen bytes — eight times. It retried,
// because eighteen bytes gave it no reason not to; the stuck watch injected
// three [stuck] notes blaming it for the retries; and it then edited two Rust
// source files with no way left to compile them. The task landed reporting work
// that had never been built, and the conversation found the breakage five
// minutes later. withdrawn.go carries the whole account.
