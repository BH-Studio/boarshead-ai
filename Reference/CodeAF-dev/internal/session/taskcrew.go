// A TASK'S CREW IS PICKED FOR THAT TASK, AT THE MOMENT IT STARTS.
//
// The /crew panel says what is allowed and what is pinned, and that persists;
// the words in the ask say how hard to try THIS task, and nothing else sticks.
// So every run this conversation starts asks the router (internal/crewroute,
// through [Config.RouteCrew]) for its worker, planner and checker, with the
// task's own title and brief to classify and the one-task effort word the
// person or the conversation said — `/task --best`, `/task --cheap`, or the
// `effort` field of a hand-off. The decision rides the run's spec into the
// engine's crew factory, rides its row to the surface (the card's crew line),
// and is written to the router's log twice: once when it is made, once when
// the task settles, which is what the router learns from.
//
// THE ROUTER IS OPTIONAL HERE AND NOTHING IS INVENTED WITHOUT IT. A session no
// door gave a router — a test, the harness — runs its tasks on its role
// ladder's seats the way it always has; the crew is a surface's decision to
// wire, never a model this package names.
//
// A HAND-OFF THAT JOINS A RUN ALREADY UNDERWAY RIDES THAT RUN'S CREW. A run is
// one crew factory, seated once; the joined work is a child of its root.

// crewWish is what a hand-off asked of its crew: the one-task effort word, and
// for a redo the crew it is asking to beat. It travels on the context the start
// door is handed, because that door has half a dozen callers and every one of
// them but two asks nothing of the crew.

//
// A routed model can be listed, priced and allowed and still refuse the first
// request a task sends it: an account out of credit, a key refused, a route
// that will not take this model, a limit reached, a model withdrawn. The task
// used to end there, in its first second, on a crew nobody chose. Now the
// failure is read into one kind (internal/provider's RouteFailure), written to
// the router's log as the ROUTE's outcome ([config.LogCrewRoute]) — which is
// what route health is learned from — and the seat walks its ladder, inside
// the task:
//
//  1. the same model on its next healthy route;
//  2. the next qualified models for the seat at a similar cost;
//  3. the seat as the last crew that completed a task here ran it;
//  4. the model the person is talking to, when it can sit the seat.
//
// The first two are the router's ([crewroute.Decision.Ladder]); the last two
// only this install knows ([config.CrewRescue]). A rung on a route this task
// has already seen fail — or on an account it has seen run out of credit, or a
// provider whose key was refused — is stepped over. With nothing left the call
// ends on ONE action read off the kind ("add credit on …", "reconnect …",
// "the limit resets at …"), never on the refusal's own text.
//
// A transient failure — a timeout, one 5xx — is asked again once first.
// ONLY A FIRST CALL COUNTS: a route that has answered once on this task has
// started, and a later error is the work's own to handle. A cancelled context
// is somebody stopping the work. A PINNED SEAT IS NEVER MOVED — the person
// chose it — and its failure ends on the same one action.
