// memory_consolidate.go is the dreaming pass over what is remembered: ONE call,
// made while nobody is here, over the fifty lines most recently touched, whose
// whole instruction is "merge the duplicates and retire what another line has
// replaced". internal/roles named this file before it existed
// ([roles.RoleConsolidate]); this is the file it named.
//
// ── WHY IT EXISTS, AND WHAT THE EVIDENCE ACTUALLY SAYS ──
//
// Nothing in the per-turn path ever revisits an old memory. internal/reflex's
// Decide settles ONE new candidate against the three lines nearest it and then
// never looks at any of them again, so a store drifts: two sessions state the
// same preference in different words, a project's state moves on, and the
// router ends up choosing between near-synonyms — which is the retrieval
// failure that costs the most (Cuconasu et al., SIGIR 2024, measure one
// top-retrieved NON-ANSWER at −18 to −20% relative, while random documents were
// harmless).
//
// Revisiting old notes is the one memory operation with a clean ablation behind
// it. A-MEM (arXiv 2502.12110, NeurIPS 2025) turns its "memory evolution" off
// and on: multi-hop F1 21.35 → 27.02, temporal 31.24 → 45.85, from rewriting
// old notes alone. SECOM (arXiv 2502.05589, ICLR 2025) measures the compression
// half by itself at +9.46. And doing it off the turn is Sleep-time Compute
// (arXiv 2504.13171): a context queried by every future message is the regime
// where precomputing pays, with the paper's own caveat that a context queried
// once is a net loss — which is why this runs over the STORE and never over one
// conversation.
//
// ── AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO ──
//
// THERE IS NO DECAY BY AGE. Not a half-life, not an expiry, not a floor on use
// count. No paper demonstrates that time-based forgetting improves anything:
// MemoryBank (arXiv 2305.10250, AAAI 2024) proposed the Ebbinghaus curve and
// never ablated it, and FadeMem (arXiv 2601.18642) — the most decay-committed
// paper in the literature — attributes its own gains to fusion and conflict
// resolution and ships no "without decay" row. What IS supported is retiring
// what has been SUPERSEDED (Memora, arXiv 2604.20006: the staleness penalty
// grows 18.2 → 29.5 from weekly to quarterly horizons). So the pass retires
// contradicted lines and lets old ones alone.
//
// IT NEVER DELETES. Every write it makes is one of the store's existing events
// — memory_update to rewrite a line, memory_supersede to retire one — and both
// leave the row readable ([store.Store.MemoryRecord]). Nothing here forgets,
// because a forget is the tombstone that records THE PERSON asking for one.
//
// AND IT NEVER RETIRES SOMEBODY'S OWN WORDS. See [consolidateMayRetire].

const consolidatePrompt = `You tidy a person's remembered notes while they are away. You are given every note, grouped by how far its truth reaches, as: id · type · title — text.

Answer with JSON and nothing else:

{"ops":[{"op":"refine","id":"<id>","title":"<new title>","text":"<new text>"}]}

Three operations, and no others:

- "refine" — rewrite ONE note so it says one clear thing. This is how two notes that overlap become one: fold what the weaker one adds into the stronger one and refine that. Keep every fact both of them carried.
- "supersede" — retire ONE note that another note has REPLACED, giving the title and text of the note that says what is true now. Use it when a note has stopped being true, never merely because it is old.
- "skip" — nothing is worth changing. Answer {"ops":[]} and that is a good answer.

Rules:

- Never retire a preference, a decision or a correction. Those are the person's own words about how they want things; you may refine their wording, never decide they have been replaced.
- Never invent a fact that is in neither note. A merged note says what the two notes said and nothing more.
- Change nothing that is already clear. Most passes should answer {"ops":[]}.
- A title is one short line, under eighty characters. Text is one line of substance.
- Touch each id at most once, and answer with at most eight operations.`
