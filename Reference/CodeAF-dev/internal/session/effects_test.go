// What the leash is told, and who decides on it.
//
// Every test here is written from ONE REAL RUN. On 2026-08-31 a cheap worker was
// handed a file to fix and rewrote it twenty-odd times in near-identical
// increments for twenty-two minutes and $7.99. Every call exited cleanly. The
// checkpoint that could have ended it was asked, was handed a list of successful
// `edit` calls, read that list as editing, and renewed the leash each time —
// until the step cap collected the run. Two things were missing and both are
// pinned below: the reader was never told whether anything had actually changed,
// and it was never made to look at the tree it was standing in.

// bytes forty times is not stopped by any repetition rule, and it is asked again
// rather than asked on every step.
//
// THE EFFECT IS IDENTICAL AND THE CALLS ARE NOT, and both halves are what take
// every real-time dependency out of the assertion. Said once, plainly: the forty
// saves leave one identical effect and forty deliberately distinct call
// signatures, so the turn's repetition guard is NOT what ends this turn and the
// leash is left as the only thing the assertion can be about.
//
// THE SAME EFFECT. Every save leaves note.md byte-for-byte what the last one left
// — the effect the leash fingerprints is the file ([effectPrintOf], effects.go) —
// and the content is EMPTY, so the file is zero bytes before, during and after
// every write. A truncating write of nothing never changes the file, so the
// fingerprint reads the same sum whenever this side of the wall gets to it,
// before or after the worker's next save. With any non-empty content that read
// races the next truncating write and the fingerprint flickers between the file
// and the write's own answer — the real-time dependency that made this test
// flake under load.
//
// NOT THE SAME CALL. The key order in the JSON is the only thing that turns over,
// so no two calls share a signature and the turn's own repetition guard
// (looped.go), which keys on the CALL, never fires. Spelled identically instead,
// the guard reads the run as a turn going in circles and hands it over at its
// seventh write, and whether the run reached its third repeat checkpoint before
// that turn ended was a race this test lost under load — the leash was never the
