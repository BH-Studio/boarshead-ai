// read_document: the ladder's OCR rung, as a hand the model actually has.
//
// The local rung (tools_pdf.go) already says the true thing about a scan — "no
// text layer, images only" — and then named a LADDER. A ladder is not a tool. A
// model that is told the OCR rungs exist and given no way to call them does the
// one thing left: `bash: pip install easyocr`, on a machine where that is a
// four-minute download, a CUDA warning, and a wrong answer. That is not the
// model being stupid; it is the same fault tools_pdf.go opens with, one rung
// higher. read said it reads files and did not read this file; then the
// refusal said a rung could and there was no rung to call.
//
// So the rung becomes a hand. internal/provider already carries the whole
// engine — ParseDocument, three verified plugins, the annotation harvest — and
// internal/exec already drives it for the workforce (internal/exec/document.go).
// Neither of those is reachable from a conversation. This file is the seam.
//
// FOUR THINGS ARE DELIBERATE.
//
// It is a SECOND TOOL and not a second sense inside read, which is the exact
// opposite of tools_pdf.go's choice, and the difference is who pays. Growing
// read was right when the answer was local, free and instant: one hand, one
// habit, no decision. This answer costs money and seconds, and a model that
// cannot tell "read a file" from "spend two cents OCRing forty pages" will
// spend it on every source file it opens. The split is where the bill is.
//
// It is ALWAYS ON THE BELT, which inverts the conditional law tools_search.go
// states and tools_image.go follows. Those two are optional back ends the
// surface may never have wired, so a tool with nothing behind it is left off
// rather than added and made to refuse. This one rides THE SESSION'S OWN
// CREDENTIALS — the same key and base URL every turn already goes out on — so
// there is nothing to be conditional about: a session that can talk to its
// model can reach the rungs. And read's refusal now names this tool by name; a
// named way out that resolves to nothing is worse than either honest state.
//
// EVERY REFUSAL NAMES A RUNG. "Document parsing failed" tells a model to try
// again; "the mistral-ocr rung failed: 402 insufficient credits" tells it to
// stop, and tells the person reading the transcript which line of settings to
// change.
//
// AND THE ANSWER OBEYS PI'S TRUNCATION LAW, through the same piReadLaw the PDF
// wrapper uses — same 2000 lines, same 50KB, same footer sentences, same
// offset to continue. The offset has to work, and paying for a forty-page OCR
// again to show page two would be the one place this ladder is allowed to rob
// somebody, so the extraction is MEMOIZED per session by content digest: the
// rung runs once, and paging through what it returned is free.
