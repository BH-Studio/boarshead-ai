// ELSEWHERE: THE WORK THIS PROJECT'S OTHER WINDOWS HAVE OUT RIGHT NOW.
//
// taskpresence.go answers "which sessions are alive", one file per session, and
// world.go answers "what is going on everywhere" for the home page. This file is
// the third question, and it is the one a person sitting IN a session asks: the
// window beside this one is running something — where is it on my screen?
//
// It exists because neither of the other two answers it. The project's index
// (task_index.go) is the only list a session's own surfaces read, and AN
// ORDINARY TASK WRITES NO ROW UNTIL IT LANDS — [Agent.reportTaskNode] appends on
// a final state and on no other, so work another window started five minutes ago
// is not in the file at all and cannot be drawn from it. The rows that ARE
// written while work runs come from an orchestrated run (orchestrate.go, which
// files a `running` row up front and promises a second row closing it), and
// those are exactly the rows that go on claiming `running` forever when the
// window that wrote them dies.
//
// So the two halves of this file are the two halves of one honest answer:
//
//   - [Elsewhere.Tasks] is what the other windows SAY they have out, which is
//     the only place ordinary cross-window work can be read from.
//   - [Elsewhere.Runs] judges an index row that claims to be running, which is
//     [SessionRow.Runs]'s judgement said over a set of windows rather than over
//     one. THE RULE IS WORLD.GO'S AND IS NOT RESTATED HERE: a live-looking row
//     counts as live only when a fresh presence file from the session that wrote
//     it names that very node, and everything else is a record of work that
//     stopped.
//
// IT IS A READING AND NOT A SUBSCRIPTION. One readdir of the bucket, one small
// JSON per session folder, and one meta.json per session for its name — cheap
// enough to take on a clock and far too expensive to take on a frame, so every
// caller holds the value it was given for a few seconds and asks again
// (internal/tui3's own cache says how long).
