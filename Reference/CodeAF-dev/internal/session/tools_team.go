// The team verbs: a manager running its team, and a member speaking in it.
//
// A team's manager is an ordinary conversation with every ordinary tool under
// the ordinary approval rules (docs/design/conversations-and-teams/DESIGN.md,
// section 5). What makes it a manager is its verbs and the digest its turns
// carry (team.go); a member has the verbs to answer and raise a conflict.
//
// THEY ARE ONE GROUP, AND THE GROUP IS ARMED, NOT SHELVED. A manager needs its
// verbs on the turn the person asks it to hand something out, so a round trip
// through `load_capability` would be a round trip on every such turn; and a
// conversation that is in no team must not pay a single byte of schema for them.
// So they are built by nobody at construction ([Agent.belt] never sees them) and
// go onto the belt at the boundary that first finds this conversation in a team
// ([Agent.teamBoundary]), through the arming door everything that grows a belt
// goes through. The fixed prefix is unchanged for everybody else, which is what
// prefixbudget_test.go holds.
//
// SEPARATE TOOLS AND NOT ONE WITH ACTIONS, for the reason the settings pair is two:
// THE APPROVAL GATE KEYS ON THE TOOL NAME. Reading a member's page and starting a
// new conversation that spends money are two different acts, and a person must
// be able to allow one and be asked about the other. So the reads, the messages
// and the stop sit on the builtin floor (cmd/codeaf's v3BuiltinApprovals) and
// `team_start` is left to the blanket mode, so it follows the current posture.
//
// THE CHANNEL IS THE TRAFFIC LOG AND NOTHING ELSE. Every write here is one
// [teams.AppendTraffic]: a message is a note or a directive, a stop is a
// [teams.KindStop] entry the member's engine watches while its turn runs, and
// a window holding it may also perform as the person's own Stop; a
// start is a [teams.KindStart] entry the interface performs by opening the new
// conversation, and the new conversation reads its brief off that same entry
// (teamevent.go's [teamBriefLine]), marked as the manager's and never the person's. None of these verbs reaches into another
// conversation directly, which is what lets the other conversation be in
// another window, on another build, or closed.
//
// A MANAGER MAY NOT ANSWER A MEMBER'S PERMISSION PROMPT, and there is no verb
// here that could. That is the person's safety gate; the brief says so.
