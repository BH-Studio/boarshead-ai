// THE BIG MACHINERY, PUT IN THE MODEL'S HANDS.
//
// Designing a sub-harness was reached by ANCHORED CUE and by nothing else: a
// sentence that began "make a harness for …" started a designer, and everything
// the person said in any other shape went to the model, which had no verb for it
// and answered with prose about harnesses instead of building one.
//
// THE DECIDING IS THE MODEL'S. That is the law this file exists to keep, and it
// is worth stating plainly because the rest of this package leans the other way:
// detection is a table lookup, the build cue was a table lookup, and both are
// written that way because a model call on every turn is a tax and a wrong yes
// is somebody's turn. A TOOL COSTS NEITHER. It is not consulted unless the model
// reaches for it, so the judgement — is this work a saved recipe, or just work —
// is made once, by the thing in this program that can actually make it, with the
// whole conversation in front of it. "Build me something that does this every
// sprint" is a build; "we should make a harness for this one day" is not; no
// regular language can tell those apart and no regex should have to try.
//
// THERE IS ONE ROAD FOR ORDINARY WORK, AND THIS FILE NO LONGER OPENS A SECOND.
// The model used to carry `run_adaptive` here — a hand that started a planned
// graph of nodes beside the conversation — and it is gone rather than gated,
// because a verb the model has is a verb it reasons around: a plain research
// question reached for the planner on width alone, before the road that actually
// wins (one worker that divides itself from the material it opened,
// task_divide.go) had been looked at once. So a chat turn now has propose_task
// and nothing else for work that leaves it. THE PLANNER ENGINE IS UNTOUCHED —
// orchestrate.go still holds the whole of it, and cmd/harness-design runs
// internal/orchestrate on a driver of its own — but NO CHAT DOOR REACHES IT AT
// ALL now: the anchored cue that read a typed request for a run is gone too
// (loop.go), so a conversation has no way to open a planned graph, by a model's
// judgement or by anybody's words.
//
// WHAT THE TOOLS DO NOT DECIDE. No hand here commits anything a person did not
// approve: build_harness starts a design that ends in a card somebody says yes
// to (harness_build.go). The model chooses to ASK; the person still chooses to
// keep and to pay.
//
// EACH HAND IS ABSENT WHERE IT CANNOT WORK, which is this codebase's law for a
// belt (tools.go) and matters more here than anywhere: a model told it can build
// a harness plans around that ability for the rest of the conversation, long
// after the first refusal. So the gates are the same ones the cue path checked —
// a store to write into, a runner to run what is written, somebody watching who
// can answer the card — and a build that fails one of them simply does not have
// the verb.

// THE TWO DESCRIPTIONS ARE PROMPT TEXT AND ARE PAID FOR ON EVERY REQUEST OF
// EVERY TURN — the whole tool-schema block is re-sent in front of each one, some
// seventy times in a single task — so they are written for density. That is not
// a licence to drop a rule: every judgement these two hands used to teach is
// still taught, once each, in the fewest words that keep it.
//
// What build_harness must still decide for the model is RECURRENCE against
// one-off work (a recipe worth repeating, or propose_task), whether the thing
// already exists (list_harnesses first), and which of the two revisions it is
// looking at — a SAVED harness is re-designed whole, a design still on its card
// is rewritten in place in its own room. What the goal must contain is stated on
// the goal field below and no longer twice.
const buildHarnessDescription = "Design a REUSABLE sub-harness: a named, versioned procedure for a shape of work this project will do AGAIN, which the turn then offers on a match. Call list_harnesses first: one that already does this is to run, not build. NEVER for one-off work - that is propose_task, whose `wide` splits a worker after it opens the material, so width is no reason to come here. Changing a SAVED harness is a new design: give the whole goal, not the difference; one still on its card is rewritten in place in its own room. Returns a TASK NUMBER; nothing is saved unless the person approves the card."

// They come as a pair because they are one decision with two answers — run what
// exists, or build something that will exist — and a model that has the second
// without the first builds a second harness for work this machine already knows
// how to do.
//
// THE THIRD ANSWER USED TO BE `run_adaptive`, and its absence is the point: the
// belt this function returns is byte-identical to a world where the chat never
// had a planner hand, which is what "absent, not refusing" means when the thing
// being taken away is a verb (this file's header).

// It is [Config.mayDesignHarness] asked of a live agent, and it is written that
// way round because the render step asks the CONFIG the same question before
// there is an agent to ask: the bullet offering `build_harness` and the
// paragraph saying what a sub-harness IS are both composed from it

// ── THE HAND A DESIGN'S OWN THREAD HAS ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// build_harness above is the conversation's hand: it commissions a page. This is
// the hand INSIDE one of those designs, and there is exactly one of it.
//
// The design's room is a place a person stands in front of a page they have just
// read. What they say there is one of two things — a question about the page, or
// a change to it — and until this tool existed the thread could only ever do the
// first. Asked for a change it said, correctly and uselessly, that a revision was
// a new design and they should go and ask for one: a person looking at a draft,
// in the draft's own room, told to leave and start over. So the second thing they
// say is a verb now, and the deciding of which of the two they said is the
// model's, made once, with the page and the whole conversation in front of it —
// the same law the two hands above are written to (this file's header).
//
// IT COMMITS NOTHING, which is the bargain every hand in this file keeps. A
// rewrite ends in another card, and the registry is untouched until the person
// approves one.

Call this with the change stated completely, and the harness is written again with their change in it: the card in front of them comes down, the designer rewrites the whole page, and a new card is raised for them to approve. Call it the moment they ask for something to be different — \"add a step that runs the linter\", \"drop the second check\", \"this should work over the whole repo, not one package\" — including when they say it sideways (\"this wouldn't catch a flake in a subpackage\", \"I don't think two steps is enough\"). Do NOT call it to answer a QUESTION: \"why two steps?\" and \"would this fit the nightly build?\" are answered here, from the page, and calling this on one of them throws away a draft the person was happy with. State the change WHOLE, in their own words plus whatever they were pointing at — the designer cannot see this room and rewrites the entire page from your one sentence. Nothing is saved by calling this, and nothing ever is until the person approves a card; it works only while their card is up, and says so if it is not."
