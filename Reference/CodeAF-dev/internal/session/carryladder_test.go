// THE MEASURED FAILURE. SWE-Marathon s4, 00:01:54Z. The round-40 ceiling ran the
// ladder that decides what the task it opens is started on. The running model's
// draft came back as seven tokens; the mastermind that writes the real brief was
// asked and never answered, and its call was cut ninety seconds later by
// [checkpointHandoffWindow] — to the millisecond. Both upper rungs answered "",
// the task opened on the person's raw request, and the worker spent twelve
// minutes and seventy calls re-deriving what the chat already held.
//
// The s2 twin of that run walked the same ladder in 1.5 s and its task opened on
// a 3.5 KB account of what had been learned. THE TWO JOURNALS WERE IDENTICAL at
// that moment: one ceiling line reading `moved`. Nothing said which rung had
// answered, nothing said the writer had been asked at all, and nothing carried
// one word of why it had not answered — the errand's own failure row was skipped
// because the deadline that killed it was checked before the row was written
