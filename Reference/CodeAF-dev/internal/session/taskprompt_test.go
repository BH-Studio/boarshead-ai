// WHAT A SURFACE IS TAUGHT ABOUT HOW TO SPEND ITS TIME, WHY IT IS TAUGHT AS A
// PRINCIPLE, AND WHY BOTH SURFACES READ THE SAME WORDS.
//
// Two unattended runs of the same brief, measured side by side. One met a
// reading of zero and went hunting for what every count had in common inside
// two minutes; it was off zero eleven minutes later. The other answered the same
// zero by reading its own work for twelve minutes, took the reading four times
// in thirty-seven, spent well over half of its calls changing things it had
// never measured, and built from scratch a component that already existed in a
// form it could have used — without ever spending the one step it would have
// cost to ask.
//
// So three principles are taught, and this file holds them to being principles.
// A prompt that taught the CASE instead — a language, a tool, a file name, a
// kind of work — would be a prompt that is wrong for whatever the next brief
// turns out to be, and codeaf's workers are handed every kind of work there is.
// The same reason shape.md names no domain (task_shape.go states it).
//
// AND IT HOLDS THEM TO BEING TAUGHT WHERE THE APPROACH IS ACTUALLY PICKED.
// Twelve further runs said the approach — and with it the whole outcome — is
// settled in the first couple of minutes of the CONVERSATION, before any task
// exists: the runs whose chat spent one step asking whether the thing already
// existed reached a real result three times out of three, and the runs whose
// chat set about making it by hand reached one none of five times in four hours.
// The principles were on the worker's page alone, so the surface that was
// deciding never read them. They are now in prompts/discipline.md, substituted
// into prompts/system.md, which the conversation and every worker both read —
// ONE wording, ONE copy each (prompt.go's [disciplinePrompt] states the law).
