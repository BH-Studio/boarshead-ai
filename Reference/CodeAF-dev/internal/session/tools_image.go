// The session's one hand for MAKING a picture, as opposed to reading one.
//
// It obeys image.go's law from the other side. A picture the person attaches is
// journaled by reference and never as bytes, because a transcript full of base64
// is a transcript that is re-sent on every step of every turn afterwards. A
// picture the MODEL makes is exactly the same object with the same cost, so it
// leaves this tool the same way: written to a file, named by its path. The tool
// result is one line of text — where it is, how big it is — and the bytes go to
// disk and nowhere else. A model that wants to look at what it made attaches the
// file like anybody else.
//
// The wire it rides is the media contract (media_contract.go): one client for
// every generation endpoint and one use-time resolver for which model serves
// which modality (docs/MULTIMODAL.md, Decisions 5-7). The pre-revision pair —
// a client and a model slug of this tool's own — is gone, and with it the pin
// ladder this file used to carry: the resolver owns the whole ladder now, all
// four rungs of it, capability-checked against the catalog before it answers.

// And the claim the contract makes, checked by the compiler rather than by a
// reader: the media client goes into [Config.Media] with no adapter between.

// imageDirectory is where a generated picture lands when the model does not say
// and the session has no folder of its own. It sits under the workspace, in the
// surface's own dot directory, so a session that paints twenty drafts leaves
// twenty files in one place a person can delete in one gesture rather than
// twenty files in the root of their repository.
//
// A session WITH a folder answers differently and [ImagesDir] holds the whole
// rule: the workspace itself when the session owns it, the session's own
// artifacts/ when the workspace is somebody's repository.
const imageDirectory = ".codeaf/images"

// The tool's own words name no directory, because the answer is not one
// directory any more ([ImagesDir]) and a description that named the wrong one
// would be teaching the model a path it cannot use. What the model needs is
// that the picture is saved and that the result says where — both of which the
// result actually does.
//
// What the middle sentences do is TEACH (docs/MULTIMODAL.md, Decision 8). A
// model that knows only "prompt in, png out" writes a fresh prompt every time
// and cannot fix what it just drew; a model that knows the path it was handed is
// itself a valid reference can edit, restyle, combine, and iterate on its own
// last render until the thing is right. That is the whole difference between one
// picture and a working loop, and it costs three clauses to say.

A first render is a draft: look at the file before you build on it or hand it over, judge it against what was asked, and iterate when it fell short.

A prompt assembled from the genre's usual clichés lands on that same average by choice — escape a genre by naming a real medium (a print process, a photographic setup, a drafting tradition), not by recoloring it.
