// The laws of the splice (steer.go), one test each:
//
//	(a) a steer cuts the current generation and lands at the boundary it makes,
//	    as user content of the SAME turn — the model reads the question, the
//	    partial work, then the correction
//	(b) several steers land in the order they were sent
//	(c) a steer that reaches the last generation before it seals is consumed by
//	    the boundary its cut creates
//	(d) a steer that missed every boundary of a turn that ANSWERED falls through
//	    onto the follow-up queue and asks its own question, on the same stream
//	(e) a steer that fell through onto an INTERRUPTED turn is dropped with that
//	    queue, said out loud first and written down — never silently, and never
//	    into the transcript of the turn it missed
//	(f) the same on a turn that FAULTED
//	(g) a steer sent when nothing is running is refused
//	(h) the record says which of the two happened, and a surface reads it back
//	(i) a transcript with no steers in it loads exactly as it always did
//	(j) a node's room steer is untouched by any of it
