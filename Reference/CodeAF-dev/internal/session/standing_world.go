// The BIRTH SEAM: what the person's standing orders put into the world of work
// that is only just starting. docs/STANDING-ORDERS.md's D10 names three
// enforcement seams — birth, landing, tick — and this file is the first of
// them, on both of the places work is born: a task node's brief, assembled just
// in time as the node starts, and a conversation's own instructions, rendered
// at the start of every turn.
//
// IT IS ONE RESOLVER CALL AND ONE SECTION, DELIBERATELY. Which orders govern a
// place is [standing.Store.Applicable]'s question and nobody else's (D5), so
// nothing here reads an altitude, an exception or a status — a second reading
// of reach would be a second answer to the one question every seam in this wave
// asks, and a task, a conversation and the /standing page would drift apart.

// standingWorldHeading titles the section on BOTH sides of this seam. It is ONE
// CONSTANT because it is one thing said twice: a heading spelled in two files is
// a heading that will one day be spelled two ways, and then the model has two
// names for the same orders and the person has none.
const standingWorldHeading = "Standing orders"

// ── THE TWO REGISTERS, AND WHY AN ORDER'S KIND PICKS ONE ────────────────────
//
// ONE INTRO OVER EVERY KIND WAS A SENTENCE THAT WAS TRUE OF ONE OF THEM. A HOLD
// is the only kind that never wakes: "always use tabs here" has no moment, no
// rhythm and no probe, and its whole work is done at birth — here, riding into
// the world of the work that starts ([standing.WhenHold] says exactly that). It
// IS a condition over this place, and the binding sentence below is the honest
// one for it. The other five kinds are APPOINTMENTS: a moment, a rhythm, a file
// that changed, a quiet machine, a look at the world. Each of them is answered
// by the pass on its own clock and none of them is a rule anybody is working
// under, so "remind me at 6 to check the deploy" arriving in a worker's brief as
// a condition it must work within made every task in the project more cautious
// for a reason the person never asked for.
//
// SO THE KIND DECIDES THE SENTENCE AND NOTHING ELSE DOES. No status, no
// altitude, no second reading of reach — which of these orders govern this place
// is [standing.Store.Applicable]'s one question (this file's header) and asking
// any part of it again here would be the drift that header exists to prevent.
// What is read is ONE FIELD against ONE NAME, and everything that is not a hold
// takes the softer register: an order whose kind this build cannot read is not a
// house rule.

// standingWorldHolding is the sentence a HOLD rides under, and it is the whole
// of what a model has to understand about the lines below it: WHOSE they are,
// that they did not arrive with this piece of work, and that they are not
// advice.
const standingWorldHolding = "These are the person's own conditions over this place. They were set before this work and they hold until the person says otherwise — they are not suggestions. Work within them."

// standingWorldWaiting is the sentence every other kind rides under. It says
// the same two things about whose they are and how long they last, and then it
// says the one thing the binding sentence must not say about an appointment:
// that it is not asking this worker for anything. A reminder is worth knowing
// about — it is what the person has going on around this work — and it is not a
// condition on the work.
const standingWorldWaiting = "These are the person's own standing orders over this place, each waiting on a moment, a rhythm or a change of its own. They are here so you know what stands; none of them is a condition over this work and none asks anything of you now."

// standingWorldReport is the closing line a TASK's section carries and a
// conversation's does not. A node works with nobody to ask, so an order it
// cannot honour has exactly one place to be said (task_contract.go); a
// conversation can say so in the very next sentence it writes.
const standingWorldReport = "If you cannot honour one of these, say so in your report."

// standingWorldMost is how many orders one section may list. A world section is
// context somebody pays for on every request of every turn, and a person with
// forty orders over a project has a working agreement, not a preamble.
const standingWorldMost = 8

// renderStandingWorld is the section itself: the heading, the orders that hold
// under the sentence that binds, the orders that are waiting under the sentence
// that does not, and the caller's closing line.
//
// THE EMPTINESS LAW. No orders is NO SECTION — not an empty heading, not "none"
// — because a brief that says nothing stands over it has spent tokens saying
// there is nothing to say. A tier with nothing in it is the same law one level
// down: no rows, no sentence introducing them.
//
// THE HOLDS LEAD, AND THAT IS THE ONE THING THE TIERS REORDER. A worker reads
// what it must obey before it reads what the person has going on, because the
// first is the only half of this section that can change what it does.
//
// LONGEST-STANDING FIRST WITHIN EACH TIER, AND THAT IS THIS SECTION'S ORDER AND
// NOT THE PAGE'S. The /standing page leads with what the person touched most
// recently, because a page is about what they are thinking about now. A world
// section is about what the work must obey, and there the settled conditions
// lead: an order that has stood for months is the house rule, and the one made
// this morning is already in the conversation above.
//
// AND WHEN SOMETHING MUST GO, IT IS NEVER A HOLD. The clip exists because a
// preamble has a budget ([standingWorldMost]), and the rows that must survive it
// are the ones that govern the work — eight reminders crowding out the one rule
// in the project would be this section spending its whole allowance on the half
// that asks for nothing. Within the holds, and within what room is left for the
// rest, the longest-standing still survive.
//
// ONE ORDER IS ONE LINE. A compiled prompt may be written across several lines,
// and a list whose rows are paragraphs is a list nothing can count, so the
// whitespace inside an order is folded before it is written.
