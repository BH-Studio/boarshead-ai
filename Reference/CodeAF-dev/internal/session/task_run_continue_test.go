// CARRYING ON A RUN NOTHING IS DRIVING.
//
// The first test is the one this cell exists for, and it is a test about
// DESTRUCTION rather than about a door: work is put in a run's copy, the run is
// carried on, and the work is still there afterwards. The road this door could
// have taken instead deletes it — task_run_copy_test.go shows that road doing
// it — so this test is the difference between the feature and a data loss with
// a friendly sentence on it.
//
// The rest pin the four refusals. Each asserts TWICE: that the door said no in
// words that name what is in the way, and that NOTHING STARTED. The second half
// is the half that matters, because a door that refuses in words and seats
// workers anyway has spent the money either way.
