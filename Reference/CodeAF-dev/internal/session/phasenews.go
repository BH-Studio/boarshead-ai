// ── THE PHASE CLOCK, FORWARDED AND EXTENDED ─────────────────────────────────
//
// internal/provider knows what a REQUEST is doing — connecting, waiting for the
// first word, thinking, writing, paced, trying again, switching lanes. This
// package knows what a TURN is doing between requests — running a tool,
// checking an answer, tidying the transcript, writing down a turn that is being
// handed over — and those waits are longer than any of the provider's: a `go
// test` runs for minutes, and the route judge that reads a finished answer has
// been measured at a quarter of an hour.
//
// Both halves are one story to the person watching, so they leave by one door.
// internal/tui3 imports this package and this package imports internal/provider,
// so the arrow points one way the whole distance (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md Decision
// 10): a surface registers [OnPhaseNews], this package forwards everything the
// transport posts and adds its own, and a build with no surface registers
// nothing and pays one nil check.
//
// THE VOCABULARY IS THE TRANSPORT'S, said once (internal/provider's phase.go).
// Two packages with two spellings of "thinking" is two surfaces that disagree
// the first time one of them is corrected.

// PhaseNews is one moment of one turn's life. It is [provider.PhaseNews] under
// this package's own name, so a surface imports one package rather than two.
type PhaseNews = provider.PhaseNews

// Phase is the word for what is happening, and it is [provider.Phase] under
// this package's own name for [PhaseNews]'s reason: ONE VOCABULARY, and a
// reader that has to import two packages to name a phase and the news carrying
// it is two spellings waiting to happen.
type Phase = provider.Phase

// The phases a turn has that a request does not. They are spelled in
// internal/provider for the reason above — one vocabulary — and named here so a
// reader of this package can see the whole list in one place.
//
// EVERY ONE OF THEM IS HELD OPEN UNTIL IT ENDS, AND IT SAYS ITSELF WHILE IT
// LASTS. A surface stops drawing a phase it has not heard again for
// [provider.PhaseWindow], and a request's own clock beats inside that window
// because a stream gives it something to beat on; a turn's phases have no
// deltas, so this package beats for them ([Agent.tellPhase] and the heart
// below). It did not, once, and the measured cost of that was a route judge
// that ran for a quarter of an hour and drew for fifteen seconds of it.

// ── A WAIT A PERSON CAN END ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A pinned lane is a person's instruction, and an instruction is asked rather
// than overridden. So where an unpinned call would quietly race somebody else,
// a pinned one raises an OFFER — `coreweave is slow · switch to auto? (y)` —
// and the answer fires the same rescue the controller would have fired, to the
// lane the frontier already named. There is no second choice made at the worst
// possible moment, and the pin itself is untouched: accepting is for THIS
// answer, and the next request goes to the pinned machine, because that is what
// a pin means.
//
// IT RIDES THE PHASE CHANNEL THAT ALREADY EXISTS. A second channel for one
// sentence is a second thing to keep alive, and the two would disagree the first
// time one of them was fixed.
//
// THE OFFER IS WITHDRAWN BY ANYTHING THAT ANSWERS IT: a visible token, which
// makes the question moot; the phase ending; and the window lapsing, so a
// question about a request that is over never sits on a screen. A thinking
// delta does NOT withdraw it — nothing has arrived that a person can read.

// PhaseAsking is a wait a person can end, and PhaseAllSlow is a wait nothing
// can: every reachable lane is believed slow, acting buys nothing, and saying
// so IS the act.
//
// THEY ARE THE TRANSPORT'S OWN WORDS AND NOT A SECOND SPELLING OF THEM. The
// vocabulary is one closed set, owned by the layer that knows what a request is
// doing (internal/provider's phase.go); these two names exist so that this
// package and the surface above it can say `session.PhaseAsking` beside every
// other phase they already name that way, and a build in which the two ever

// ── THE BEAT: A STAGE THAT IS STILL RUNNING IS STILL DRAWN ──────────────────
//
// THE DEFECT THIS FIXES, measured: the route judge at the end of a turn — one
// `tellPhase(PhaseChecking, …)` in loop.go — ran for a quarter of an hour and
// the screen drew it for fifteen seconds. A surface drops a phase it has not
// heard again for [provider.PhaseWindow] (internal/tui3's phaseWindow), which
// is the right rule and the only thing standing between a person and a clock
// that runs forever after a goroutine was killed. What was missing was the
// other half of that bargain: something to keep saying a phase that is STILL
// TRUE.
//
// A REQUEST HAS DELTAS TO BEAT ON AND A TURN HAS NOTHING. internal/provider's
// clock re-says its phase off the stream itself, once a second, because a
// stream is arriving; the waits in THIS package are a tool running, a gate
// reading, a compaction, a brief being written, a mark being read — long
// silences with no event inside them at all. So the beat is a timer, and it is
// ONE timer that every holder gets by holding a phase, rather than a workaround
// per site. The first workaround is already gone: the briefing stage used to
// post itself twice, once per model call, and said so in its own comments
// (checkpoint.go).

// phaseHeldBeat is how often a phase this package is holding open says itself
// again while it lasts.
//
// IT IS DERIVED FROM THE WINDOW AND NEVER WRITTEN DOWN BESIDE IT. How long a
// phase describes the present is a contract between whoever posts one and
// whoever draws one, spelled once in [provider.PhaseWindow]; a beat with its own
// hand-written number is a stage that goes dark the first time somebody tunes
// the window. A third of the window means two beats may be lost — to a busy
// frame, a machine under load, a stop-the-world pause — before anything a person
// is reading blinks.
//
// It is a var rather than a const for exactly one reason: the tests that prove a
// stage outlasting the window keeps drawing shorten it, and a test that waited
// five real seconds per beat would cost more than the defect it guards.

//
