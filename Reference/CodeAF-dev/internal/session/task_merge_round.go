// ── THE MERGE ROUND: ONE ATTEMPT AT A CONFLICT BEFORE IT IS A PERSON'S CALL ──
//
// A node whose work HOLDS and whose branch will not fasten is not a question
// about the work. Somebody changed the same lines on the person's branch while
// the node was working, and the two versions have to be brought together — which
// is ordinary work, of exactly the kind the node just did, and which the person
// was being handed because nothing here had ever tried it.
//
// So it is tried, once. The person's branch is merged INTO THE TASK'S BRANCH,
// inside the task's own working copy, where a conflict marker can be written
// without anybody's checkout being touched. A worker is put in front of the
// markers with the brief and both sides. The check runs again on what it left.
// The landing is retried. Only a round that fails reaches the card.
//
// ── THE THREE LAWS THIS FILE KEEPS ──
//
// NOTHING IS REWRITTEN IN PLACE. Before the merge, the task branch's tip is kept
// under a ref of its own ([beforeMergeRef]) — so whatever this round does, the
// branch the node actually produced is still nameable afterwards, by a person at
// their own terminal and by a second round.
//
// A CONFLICT MARKER NEVER REACHES THE PERSON'S CHECKOUT. Everything below runs
// in the node's worktree, on the node's branch; the person's tree is not read,
// not stashed and not merged into until the ordinary landing is retried
// (task_ledger.go's [landHome], groundcarry.go).
//
// AND A CONFLICT IS NEVER THE MODEL'S TO ACCEPT. The round is the ENGINE's, and
// what it produces is either a branch that merges — which lands the ordinary way,
// through the ordinary check — or a card with the files named. The one thing it
// may not do is decide on somebody's behalf that two versions of a file were
// really one.
