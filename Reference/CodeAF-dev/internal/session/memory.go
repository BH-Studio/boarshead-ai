package session

// Memory is what one conversation knows and the next one would otherwise have
// to be told again.
//
// It used to be a file of lines — ~/.codeaf/v3/memory.md, appended to by a
// `note` tool, filtered by a `forget` tool, and rendered whole into the system
// prompt of every turn. That shape had one virtue (a person could read it) and
// one fatal property: it only ever grew, and everything in it was paid for on
// every request whether or not the turn had anything to do with it.
//
// What replaces it is the store's event-sourced brain (internal/store's
// memory.go) with a per-turn reflex in front of it (internal/reflex). The
// arrangement is four moments, and every one of them is optional:
//
//   - BEFORE THE TURN, the store ranks what is remembered against the message
//     just typed and hands the router a SHORTLIST of eight titles — never
//     bodies ([store.Store.MemoryCandidates]). The router answers which two or
//     three of them bear on it, and only those are rendered into the <memory>
//     block, each stamped with how long ago it was learned. A thousand
//     remembered things cost the same small call as eight do, where the file
//     cost all thousand.
//
//   - AFTER THE TURN, off the person's path entirely, the extractor reads the
//     exchange and answers whether it held anything worth carrying into another
//     session. Almost always it did not, which is the answer the gate is shaped
//     around. It answers a second question in the same call: which of the lines
//     this turn was shown actually bore on the answer, which is the only thing
//     the store's ranking counts.
//
//   - WHEN IT DID, the decider settles the new thing against what the store
//     already holds near it: add it, refine one of them, replace one of them, or
//     skip. That is what keeps the same preference stated in three sessions from
//     becoming three rows.
//
//   - AND THE MODEL HAS ONE HAND OF ITS OWN, `remember`, which walks the same
//     decide-and-apply path synchronously so the answer it gets back is the
//     title that actually landed.
//
// THE WHOLE FEATURE IS ABSENT RATHER THAN BROKEN WHEN THERE IS NO STORE. A nil
// [Config.Memory] is memory off: no block, no reflex call, and no `remember` on
// the belt — the model does not have the verb. That is what the memory.enabled
// row turns off, at the door, by declining to open a brain at all.
//
// A REFLEX FAILURE IS INVISIBLE. Every call here fails open: the block is empty,
// the extraction never happened, and the turn is exactly the turn it would have
// been if this file did not exist. internal/reflex states that law; this is the
// half of it that has to keep it.

// request carries, so a recall that is merely DROPPED is a turn answered without
// the person's own preferences in front of it, and a dropped route also leaves the
// store's outcome ledger silent about lines it never got to offer — which is how
// the ranking learns. So nothing here drops anything. Every answer is APPLIED:
//
//   - Back before the request is assembled — the ordinary case once the whole
//     front of the turn overlaps it — and the first request carries it, exactly as
//     it always did.
//   - Back after the request went out but before the model's first token: the
//     generation is cut and re-asked ONCE, with the block in
//     ([Agent.cutGeneration], loop.go's errRecallCut). The person has read nothing
//     yet, so nothing is taken off their screen, and the provider's own prefix
//     cache makes the second send the cheap one.
//   - Back after the first token: it is LATE, and late means the NEXT step of this
//     same turn carries it — the block is already in the transcript by then — with
//     the lateness written down rather than passed over in silence.
//
// IT IS A [sidecar] LIKE EVERY OTHER READING BESIDE THE WORK (sidecar.go), with
// three facts of its own bolted on: whether the person has started reading, the
// one re-ask this turn may buy, and whether the block ended up late. Those are

// refreshSystemLocked rebuilds message[0] from the base prompt, the folders
// somebody attached, the person's standing orders and this session's record of
// what it has decided.
//
// message[0] is REPLACED rather than appended to: a.system stays the base, so
// every refresh renders base + current blocks instead of stacking one act's
// block on top of the last one's.
//
// THE ATTACHED FOLDERS ARE THE THIRD BLOCK and they are here for the standing
// orders' reason exactly: a folder somebody attached holds for the life of the
// conversation until they remove it, so it moves once per deliberate act and
// otherwise renders byte for byte (placescontext.go).
//
// THE DECISION RECORD IS A SNAPSHOT AND NOT A LIVE READING, and that is the one
// thing in this block that does not move when the thing behind it does. A
// question answered — every `ask`, and every `allow once` on a tool — used to
// rewrite this message the moment the answer was applied, which bought a cold
// prefix over the whole conversation for a line the model already had: the
// answer's own tool result is in front of it either way, and what the record is
// FOR is the gate that refuses the same question twice ([Question.Check] reads
// the file, not this). So the section is re-read only when message[0] is being
// rebuilt for some OTHER reason — a folder attached, a standing order agreed,
// the clock brought forward — all of which re-price the prefix anyway, and every
// decision made since rides in the transcript where it happened.
//
// WHAT LIVES HERE IS WHAT MOVES ONLY ON A DELIBERATE ACT, and that is the whole
// rule. message[0] sits in front of every message there is, so one changed byte
// in it re-prices the entire transcript at the uncached rate — five times the
// cached one — on the very next request. The base prompt never moves. A folder
// somebody attached holds until they remove it. An order was agreed on a card
// and holds until the person says otherwise, and a conversation may run all day
// without one moving (standing_world.go). A decision is recorded when a question
// is answered and never again. Each of those is a thing a person did, at most a
// handful of times in a session, and what it costs is the same cold prefix the
// clock costs when it is brought forward (prompt.go's clockRefresh), for the
// same reason: a model reasoning from a stale standing fact is worse than a
// re-priced conversation.
//
// THE BLOCKS THAT MOVE ON A TURN ARE NOT HERE, and the memory block was the last
// of them to leave. The state card is rewritten by the post-turn pass every time
// a delta lands and the other windows' work is re-read at the start of every
// turn; the routed memory block is re-chosen against the person's own words at
// the start of every turn, and [renderMemoryBlock] re-stamps every line it keeps
// with an age label whose granularity is hourly for anything learned today
// (store.AgeLabel), so it can move on a turn where the router chose identically.
// All three ride at the TAIL of the transcript now, as appended notes
// ([Agent.landVolatileLocked]), where a change costs the note and nothing behind
// it. What that buys is stated as a law and pinned as one: message[0] is
// byte-identical from one turn to the next unless somebody did something
// (prefixcache_test.go).
//
// WHAT MOVING THE MEMORY BLOCK COSTS is a superseded line left standing in the
// transcript where it was said, which is why the note it rides in says the last
// one holds ([memoryNoteOpening]). That is the trade, and it is the right way
// round: a stale line the model is told is stale is cheaper than re-pricing
