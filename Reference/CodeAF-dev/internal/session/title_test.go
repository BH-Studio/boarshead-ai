// The namer is no longer a step of the turn. Since the naming moved to the
// moment the first message is ACCEPTED (title.go), it runs on a goroutine
// nothing orders against the turn's own calls — so a positional script cannot
// hold a slot for it, and a fixture that tried would be a coin toss between the
// turn eating the namer's answer and the namer eating the turn's.
//
// Every test below therefore routes it by PURPOSE. [scriptedCompleter.aside] is
// consulted before the step queue is touched (agent_test.go), so the namer's
// answer is the namer's whatever order the two goroutines run in, and the turn
// rides exactly the script the test wrote. Nothing here asserts a call INDEX;
// what is asserted is which errand got which answer, which is the fact these
// tests are about.
