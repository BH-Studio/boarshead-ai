// A PROGRAM WORKS IN THE FOLDER IT IS GIVEN, AND IN A COPY OF ITS OWN ON A
// BRANCH OF ITS OWN WHEN THAT FOLDER IS A GIT REPOSITORY.
//
// THE CONTRACT. This is the whole of what codeaf does to the folder a program
// that edits files works in (senior-dev first), for a run a conversation hands
// off and for one a person starts at a shell alike; senior-dev.md and
// delegates.md say it in a person's words.
//
//  1. WHICH FOLDER. The folder the proposal names as `ground`, or the
//     conversation's own when it names none (a typed `/senior-dev` names none),
//     or the one a shell run was started in or named with `--dir`. Inside a git
//     repository it is the repository's root unless git ignores the asked-for
//     folder, which runs as a plain folder. It is never the home folder or a folder holding it
//     ([programHomeRefusal]). A folder that is not there yet is made, empty,
//     when the folder it would be made in is there.
//  2. A GIT REPOSITORY — history, a commit, and a root below the home folder.
//     The program works in a copy of its own: a git worktree in a private
//     folder under this account's cache folder, on a branch of its own cut
//     from the commit the person's checkout stands on, removed when the
//     program exits so the branch is released and kept. THE PERSON'S CHECKOUT IS NEVER TOUCHED,
//     so it is never refused for its uncommitted changes either, and several
//     runs may work on one repository at once. programcopy.go is the whole of
//     it.
//  3. ANYTHING ELSE — no history, no commit yet, or a repository whose root is
//     the home folder or above it: the program works in the folder as it is,
//     started with its own flags for that ([delegate.Delegate.PlainFolder];
//     senior-dev's `--in-place`). codeaf passes them whenever it decided so,
//     because the program's own reading of a folder climbs to any repository
//     around it.
//  4. WHEN IT ENDS — done, not finished, stopped, crashed, or its process gone
//     — in a repository, what the program left uncommitted in its copy, except
//     paths ignored at start and known test droppings, is committed onto its
//     branch in one commit with its usable message, or the title and ending
//     as a fallback; a run that did not pass carries its ending too, and the
//     copy is removed (programcopy.go) — unless what it left could be kept
//     nowhere else, when the copy stays and the ending says where. In either kind of folder the program's
//     notes ([delegate.Delegate.Notes]) are moved into the run's record folder
//     unless they were there before the run.
//  5. ONE RUN PER PLAIN FOLDER. codeaf starts and stops the run and keeps its
//     money, its time and its screen, and nothing else. A second program run
//     on a plain folder one is working in, or on a folder inside it or around
//     it — from any conversation, any window, or a shell — is refused, naming
//     the run that holds it; the hold is a file lock, which dies with the
//     last process holding it — codeaf and the program it hands it to
//     (programhold.go). A run in a copy holds only its
//     copy, which is why runs on one repository never wait for each other.
//
// WHY THERE IS SO LITTLE HERE. Until 2026-09-24 a program ran through the
// general task machinery: a copy of the folder cut for every run, the brief's
// paths rewritten to name the copy, the program's commits squashed and its
// HEAD put back at the landing, and a ladder of placement rules, each layer
// patching the one before it. The owner asked why it was so hard to have
// senior-dev just work on the problem — "if it's in a git repo, great - if
// not, just do it" — and the answer was that codeaf had made it hard. The
// copy, the rewriting, the squash and the ladder went. Until 2026-09-28 the
// program then worked in the person's checkout itself, switched onto its
// branch, which held the whole repository for one run at a time; the owner
// asked for runs side by side, and the copy came back as a worktree the
// program's run owns start to end — with no squash, no landing and no
// rewriting, only a line at the head of the brief ([ProgramFolder.BriefNote]).
//
// ONE ROAD FOR BOTH DOORS. The conversation's run (task_run_belt.go) and the
// shell's `codeaf senior-dev` (cmd/codeaf/carried.go) prepare a folder with
// [PrepareProgramFolder] and finish it with [ProgramFolder.Finish], so a
// person at a shell and a person in the chat get the same folder, the same
// branch, the same refusals and the same last sentence.
