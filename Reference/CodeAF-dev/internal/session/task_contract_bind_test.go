// A WORKTREE TASK HAS ONE WORKER-FACING PATH NAMESPACE: ITS PRIVATE COPY.
//
// This is issue #566, reproduced with nothing scripted but the model. The task
// engine can hold two contradictory truths at once: the worker is stood up in
// `<session>/trees/<id>` and handed a contract whose WHAT TO PRODUCE names the
// person's live checkout. A worker that follows the address it was given reads
// the directory that is still moving under it, and its first write at that same
// address is refused by [taskGroundGuard] as "is outside your copy".
//
// The isolation is right and the guard is right. What is wrong is the handoff:
// a contract path at or below the node's ground must be bound to the equivalent
// path inside the copy that was actually cut, BEFORE the worker is asked
// anything.
