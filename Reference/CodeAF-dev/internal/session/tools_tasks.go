// THE MODEL'S WAY BACK TO OLD WORK.
//
// The "@" mention (internal/tui3) is the person's half of this: they remember a
// task, they point at it, and a pointer block goes into the prompt. This file is
// the other half, and it exists because THE COMMON CASE IS THAT THEY DO NOT
// POINT. "Do that thing we did to the reconciler last week, but for the
// scheduler" is a sentence with no id in it, no title in it and no path in it,
// and until this tool the only honest answer a model had was to ask.
//
// It is a BELT TOOL and not a hub op, and the choice is worth stating because
// the design this implements names a hub. This build has no hub: the model
// reaches everything it can reach through bare.Tool (tools.go), and the two
// nearest neighbours of this op — `jobs`, which looks at background work, and
// `watch`, which is told about it — are both belt tools with an action-shaped
// schema. A second entry-point mechanism for one op would be a second
// vocabulary for the model to learn and a second place for this build to keep
// its wire discipline. So `tasks` sits on the belt beside `jobs`, and reads the
// same way.
//
// A NODE GETS IT SCOPED TO ITS OWN FAMILY, and never wider. A node's brief is
// its whole world by contract (task_contract.go), so a node rummaging through
// the project's history is a node reading the conversation it was deliberately
// given none of. What a node DOES have a right to is the work it handed out
// itself (task.go's fan-out law): the pieces it split off, how they are going,
// what they found, and one line into one that is going the wrong way. So inside
// a node every op here answers about its own children and about nothing else —
// the search lists them, an id outside them is refused by name, and a node that
// handed nothing out gets an empty list rather than the project's.

// AND THE POLLING SENTENCE IS PAID FOR RATHER THAN ADDED. `Never to WAIT for
// handed-off work` is here because a model polled this tool eleven times in one
// turn for a report that was going to be delivered to it (tasklook.go). Its
// bytes come out of the URI gloss this string used to carry — what an artifact
// URI and a transcript URI ARE is said in full by prompts/system.md, in the same
// fixed prefix, three lines from where it says to call this tool. One fact, one
// place.
//
// WRITTEN FOR DENSITY, BECAUSE THIS STRING IS BILLED ON EVERY REQUEST OF EVERY
// TURN. The tool-schema block rides in front of each request the model makes —
// dozens per task — so a paragraph here is paid for dozens of times while a Go
// comment beside it is free. Every rule the old description stated is still
// stated; what went is the rhetoric, and the sentences the schema's own fields
// say better. A rule belongs in the field it governs and appears ONCE.
//
// AND THE STOP VERB IS SPELLED OUT IN IT rather than left to the field, because
// the sentence a model has to have BEFORE it reaches for a field is which field
// ends work. Asked to stop task 2, a model with no stop verb said "stop, do not
// continue" into the task with `say`; the worker wrote down that it had been
// told to stop, delivered nothing, and the check read that as an ordinary
// unfinished run and opened a repair round on it. The task went on spending for
// as long as it took somebody to notice.
// AND THE ROUTING SENTENCE LEFT (2026-09-10, the prompt diet). "Use it when the
// person means earlier work without pointing at it, or to look inside running
// work" is a WHEN-TO-REACH rule, and a description is a CONTRACT: what the tool
// does, what its fields take, what comes back. Which verb a request routes to is
// stated once, on the page's own routing table, rather than once per tool here —
// eighteen descriptions each carrying their own routing clause is the same table
// written eighteen times and billed on every request of every turn.
