// A PERSON'S STOP REACHES A RUN.
//
// A run under the bash belt is published as rows that wear a task's number: its
// own row, and one more for every hand-off that joined it. A surface stops a row
// by the number it wears, as `task:N` ([Agent.Cancel]), and the model's own stop
// does the same. Until this file that id went to the task graph and nowhere
// else, and the graph has never heard of a run's rows: measured on the real
// binary on 2026-09-19, the stop card's "stop it" answered "there is no task 1
// in this session" four times of four, the run's own page answered with the
// store's sentence about who owns what, and the run carried on to its own
// landing. The run was started on a context nothing could cut, and no cancel
// was kept anywhere.
//
// THE ID A SURFACE ALREADY SENDS IS RESOLVED TO WHOEVER OWNS THE ROW. Nothing
// on the wire changes, so a window built before this file stops a run through
// an engine built after it. [Agent.cancelTask] asks the live run first and the
// graph second, and the page's own stop on the run's task takes the same road
// ([Agent.PlanCancel]).
//
// WHAT A STOP OF A RUN DOES, IN ORDER, AND WHY THE ORDER:
//
//	the store first   the run's task and everything open under it are ended in
//	                  one write ([plandb.Store.StopRoot]). A worker that comes
//	                  home after that finds its task already ended and writes
//	                  nothing over it, so no part of a stopped run reads as a
//	                  failure with a cut call's error for its reason. And a store
//	                  whose run is over reads as over on its page.
//	the context next  every worker and every call a worker has out was handed
//	                  this context, so the spend ends here and not at the next
//	                  pass of anybody's loop.
//	the work last     once the engine has answered that its workers are home,
//	                  what they had made is committed on the run's own branch and
//	                  the copy is given back ([keptWork], the road every stopped
//	                  task takes). NOTHING GOES INTO THE PERSON'S FOLDER: work
//	                  that was stopped half-way is work nobody checked. A
//	                  program's run has no copy: its folder is finished the way
//	                  every ending of it finishes it ([ProgramFolder.Finish]), on
//	                  its own branch, which the person's branch never becomes.
//
// IT IS IDEMPOTENT, like every other stop here (cancel.go): a second press on a
// run that is stopping says so, and a press on a run that is over says that.
