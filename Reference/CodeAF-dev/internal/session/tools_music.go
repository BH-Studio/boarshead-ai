// generate_music is the session's composer: a description of a piece of music
// in, an mp3 on disk, a note naming it when it lands.
//
// It is `speak`'s sibling on the belt (tools_speak.go) and NOT its twin on the
// wire, which is the one thing worth knowing about it. Speech posts to
// /audio/speech; music has no media endpoint on the router at all and is
// composed through streaming chat completions asking for an audio modality back
// (internal/provider/music.go states the three wire rules and how each was
// learned). Two models, two lanes, one family.
//
// SO IT IS A SECOND VERB AND NOT AN ARGUMENT ON speak. A voice name is
// meaningless to a music model and a composition brief is meaningless to a TTS
// model; one verb taking both would be a verb whose arguments contradict each
// other depending on a model slot the model cannot see.
//
// IT ANSWERS BEFORE IT IS FINISHED, by generate_video's law (tools_video.go
// states it whole). A compose is one long streaming call — most of a minute is
// normal — and a turn that sat inside it was a conversation nobody could use
// while a file nobody could hear yet was written. So the call submits, comes
// back in a breath with a job id, and the composing happens in a goroutine
// whose ending is a note naming the file — the same id space, the same log,
// the same row in `jobs list`, the same `jobs kill`, the same death at Close.
// A model that has learned what a video render is has learned what this is,
// and it keeps working — on the clips, on the stitch, on the conversation —
// while the score is written.
//
// THE BYTES NEVER ENTER THE TRANSCRIPT, for tools_speak.go's reason and more so:
// a minute of music is a megabyte and base64 inflates it by a third. The note
// is one line naming the file, and the file is what the person plays.
//
// IT HAS NO LENGTH ARGUMENT because the endpoint has none. A call composes
// whatever the model decides to write — half a minute to a minute in practice,
// and Lyria's clips land nearer thirty seconds — and costs the same whether
// the piece is eight seconds or eighty, so there is no cheap call to offer and
// no knob to pretend there is (design-law §EMPTINESS applied to an argument:
// better absent than accepted and ignored). The one consequence worth the
// model knowing: a score for anything timed — a video, a slideshow — is cut
// from what comes back, looped or trimmed, and the file must be measured
// before anything is laid against it.

// The description carries the async law in the model's own terms, exactly as
// generate_video's does and for its reason: a model that does not know the
// call returns before the file exists reads the job line as a failure and pays
// twice. It also says the two things a model cannot guess — that the prompt is
// a DESCRIPTION OF MUSIC and not lyrics to be sung or words to be read out,
// and that the piece's length is the model's own choice.
const generateMusicDescription = "Compose music from a description and save it as an audio file. This tool RETURNS IMMEDIATELY with a background job id, because a compose takes most of a minute: the work keeps going while you and the user carry on talking, and when it lands you are told in a note naming the file — you do not wait for it, poll it, or call it twice. The prompt describes the MUSIC: genre, instruments, tempo, mood, structure — it is not lyrics to sing and not text to read out. For a voiceover or for text spoken aloud use speak instead, which is a different model. There is no length argument: the model writes a piece of its own choosing — half a minute to a minute in practice — and the call costs the same however long it turns out, so ask for one piece and iterate on the description rather than calling this repeatedly for a shorter one. To lay the piece under anything timed, measure the file first and loop or trim it: its length is the model's choice, not yours. Give a path to choose the name and the folder; leave it out and the file is saved under a timestamped name derived from the description. Watch it with the jobs tool and stop it with jobs kill; a stopped compose saves nothing."
