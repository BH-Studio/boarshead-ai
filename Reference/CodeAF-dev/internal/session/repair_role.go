// THE CASCADE: THE ONE PLACE THIS BUILD BUYS THE EXPENSIVE MODEL ON PURPOSE.
//
// A crew is cheap by design — the shipped one runs work on a flash-class model
// and keeps the careful tier for the handful of calls whose answer decides
// something (internal/roles). What that buys in money it occasionally loses in
// quality, and until this file existed the harness had no way to spend its way
// out of a specific failure: a node that came back short was handed back to the
// SAME model that had just come back short, with the same hands and the same
// blind spot, and the second attempt was the first attempt's twin.
//
// ── WHY THE REFUTATION IS THE RIGHT MOMENT TO PAY ──
//
// Escalating a whole crew is the obvious answer and it is the wrong one: it
// pays the careful tier's price on every node, including the great majority
// that were never going to fail, and the bill lands before anybody knows
// whether it was needed. The auditor's finding is the opposite kind of moment.
// It is a MEASURED FAILURE — a fresh, read-only judge ran the repository's own
// verification against the frozen acceptance and said, with evidence, that the
// cheap hands did not finish the job — so the escalation is bought after the
// fact rather than on a guess, on exactly the nodes that turned out to need it.
//
// And it is bought on the CHEAPEST WORK THERE IS. A repair round is not the
// task again: it runs in the worktree the first attempt already filled, it is
// told the work stands, and it is handed the auditor's gaps verbatim
// (task_audit.go's repairInstruction). The expensive model therefore reads a
// focused instruction about a narrowed problem, on a tree somebody else already
// built, which is the smallest slice of a task anybody can buy.
//
// ── AND IT FLOORS BY ITSELF ──
//
// [roles.Ladder]'s last rung is the model the work is already on, so a crew that
// has configured no tiers, and a crew whose careful tier IS the flash model,
// both resolve this role to the model the node started on. That is not a special
// case anybody has to write: an all-flash install repairs on flash, no
// escalation happens, nothing is recorded, and the ladder needed no branch to
// say so.
//
// ── WHAT THE CASCADE IS NOT ALLOWED TO OVERRULE ──
//
// A model somebody NAMED for this piece of work wins. The cascade is a default —
// the harness's own answer to "which hands should close these gaps" when nobody
// said — and a default that overrode an explicit pick would be this package
// deciding it knows better than the person who typed the model's name, on work
// they are still watching. See [TaskNode.modelPicked].

// The hands that fix what the cheap hands got wrong are [roles.RoleRepair] —
// declared there with every other role's word, which carries the reasoning for
// the tier — and REGISTERED HERE, where the call is.
//
// THE WORD AND THE REGISTRATION ARE DIFFERENT THINGS and this file used to
// conflate them. The registry is open: a package that adds an auxiliary call
// says so at the call, which is why the Register lives here and why the
// description is passed from here — internal/roles cannot write a line for a
// role it does not know about, and a settings row with a blank under its name is
// a call somebody is paying for and cannot read. But the WORD is vocabulary, and
// everything that asks what the roles are reads one file. Spelled here as
// `roles.Role("repair")` it was invisible to all of them.

// answer for the same reason internal/orchestrate's careful parts take it:
// nothing here may invent a model id, and the model the work is already on is
// the one thing that is certainly real.
//
// THE LOCKS ARE TAKEN ONE AT A TIME. The node's fields live under the graph's
// lock and the agent's under its own, and this package takes one at a time
// ([Agent.newTaskAgent] says so about the same pair), so both node reads happen
// before a.mu is touched.

// <model>" back: ONE SOURCE OF TRUTH for "was a model asked for here". A node
// that named nothing has a resolved id in `spec.model` exactly as a node that
// named one does, so the id alone cannot tell the two apart, and a cascade that
// read it would think every node in the session had been pinned.
//
// A PERSON PICKING IN THE NODE'S OWN ROOM COUNTS TOO, which is why

// all along is a fact nobody can spend. Absent means the ladder floored — no
// escalation was bought — which is the emptiness law read as a bill.
//
// It is written from the model the CHILD reports rather than from the id the
// cascade asked for, because a worker can be moved between the two (the tool-use
// rescue in [Agent.newTaskAgent]), and a row naming the model that was requested
// while another one did the work is a row that cannot be reconciled against a
// provider's invoice.
// It ANSWERS WHETHER IT WROTE ANYTHING, so that the job log and the index row
// cannot disagree about whether an escalation happened: the rule for that lives
// here, and a caller that asked the question a second way would be a second rule.
