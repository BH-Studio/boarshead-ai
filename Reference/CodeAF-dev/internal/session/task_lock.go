package session

// The lock over one repository's shared git state.
//
// A worktree add, a merge, a worktree remove and a branch delete all write the
// ROOT repository's index and its refs, and git guards those with .git/index.lock
// — a file it creates, refuses to wait on, and reports as "another git process
// seems to be running". That report is indistinguishable, from where comeHome
// stands, from a real conflict: the merge fails, the branch is kept, and the
// person is told their finished task did not land cleanly when the only thing
// that happened was that two of them tried at the same instant.
//
// A process-local mutex closed that hole for two nodes in one session and left
// it wide open for the shape people actually work in: two codeaf windows on one
// repository, each running tasks. So the serialization is a FILE lock now, and
// the mutex in front of it is only the cheap first gate for this process's own
// goroutines.
