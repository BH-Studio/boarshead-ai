// THE USAGE LEDGER: WHAT THIS MACHINE SPENT, BY DAY, BY MODEL, ON WHAT.
//
// Every figure a spend page wants already existed and none of it was reachable.
// One `journalUsage` line is written per model call (sessionfile.go) and it
// carries the model, the role, the calls, the four token counts, the cost and a
// timestamp — model, cost and time coexisting on exactly one record in the whole
// program. But that record lives INSIDE one conversation's transcript, and the
// replay arm that reads it sums the numbers into a flat [Usage] and throws the
// model, the role and the timestamp away. So "what did opus cost me this month"
// could only be answered by opening every transcript on the machine — the exact
// read `Meta.SpentUSD` was invented to avoid — and "what did I spend on Tuesday"
// could not be answered at all, because a conversation's own spend is a lifetime
// scalar with no day in it.
//
// This is the second write of the same fact, into one machine-wide append-only
// file, keyed by day. It is GLOBAL where a transcript is per-conversation, for
// artifacts.jsonl's reason: "what has this machine been spending on" is a
// cross-project question, and a per-project answer to it is not an answer.
//
// ── SIX RULES ──
//
//   - ONE ROW PER CALL, WRITTEN AS THE CALL IS DECODED. The provider's usage
//     block is in hand at exactly one moment — [Agent.addUsage], the same line
//     that banks the money into the session's own meter — and the row goes out
//     from there. It used to be written at the END OF A TURN instead
//     ([Agent.sealTurn]), which meant a turn that never sealed — interrupted,
//     stopped, crashed, or simply still running while somebody looked — was
//     money the meter had and this file never got. One measured chat held
//     $0.087 of it, every call of a final interrupted turn, invisible to every
//     surface but the status line (issue #269). [Agent.bank] is now the ONE
//     door: nothing can move the meter without offering this file a row, so the
//     two cannot come apart. The turn's seal still stamps the TRANSCRIPT — the
//     duration and the turn's own shape are facts about a turn — and writes
//     nothing here.
//   - IT IS WRITTEN WHERE THE CALL WAS MADE, AND A FOLD IS NOT A CALL. A task
//     node journals its own turns and then its whole tally is folded into the
//     conversation that spawned it (task_run.go's [Agent.foldTaskUsage]), which
//     is right for a session's own books and would be double counting here. The
//     fold has its own door ([Agent.addFoldedUsage]) that writes no ledger line,
//     and this file's totals are therefore each call once. EVERY CHILD AGENT IS
//     UNDER THIS RULE, not only a task node: an adaptive run's worker
//     (orchestrate.go's [orchestrateExec.spend]) journals its own calls here and
//     folds home silently. It folded through the auxiliary door until issue
//     #168, and the day this file's rail reads was double on every one of them.
//   - IT NEVER BLOCKS A TURN, AND THE TURN'S OWN GOROUTINE NEVER TOUCHES THE
//     DISK. [RecordUsage] serializes the row and hands it to a bounded queue
//     that one background writer per ledger drains ([usageWriter]); a full
//     queue drops the row rather than waiting on it, and so does a write that
//     fails. A home directory on a stalled mount therefore costs a spending
//     record and never a person's turn — which the older shape, an
//     open-write-close under a process-wide mutex, could not promise. AND THE
//     DROP IS COUNTED WHERE IT HAPPENS ([UsageDrops]), because a gap nobody can
//     see is a bill that reads as smaller than it was: the spend surfaces say
//     how many records went missing rather than quietly under-reporting.
//   - A LINE THAT SPENT NOTHING IS NOT WRITTEN. The emptiness law applied to a
//     file: a call whose usage block or later receipt carries no cost and no
//     tokens leaves no priced row — an explicit unbilled marker records a
//     missing receipt separately, so a day with no line is a day nothing was
//     measured as spent, rather than a day whose rows all say zero.
//   - A CALL THE WIRE NEVER PRICED IS ASKED ABOUT LATE, NEVER GUESSED. A cut
//     stream that named its generation can be matched to the provider's own
//     receipt after the turn has already moved on. A found receipt enters
//     through [Agent.bank] and marks its row reconciled; no id, no route, or no
//     receipt leaves an unbilled marker without invented money and moves
//     [UnbilledCalls] as well. The
//     fetch is background work in internal/provider, so neither the request nor
//     this ledger may make a reply wait.
//   - IT IS READ THROUGH A CACHE THAT READS THE TAIL. Home's clock beats every
//     three seconds and this file grows by a line per call, so a reader that
//     re-parsed the whole file whenever it changed would re-parse it after every
//     turn forever. [UsageCache] keeps what it has parsed and reads only what
//     was appended since ([UsageCache.Read]).
//
// WHAT IT HOLDS AND WHAT IT DOES NOT, said plainly, because a page must not
// imply otherwise. It now holds WHICH SEAT a call ran under — the tier's word
// ([Seat], usage_seat.go), with the registry's own name beside it where the
// call named one ([UsageLine.Role]) — so "did the money go on the seat that
// does the work or the seat that thinks" is answerable from this file alone. It
// still does not hold: the four-way token split (input and output are kept, the
// cache share is not — the journal this line's session id names has it), which
// of the five router slots a call ran under (nothing records that anywhere; the
// seat is the tier's chair and NOT the router's slot), and any title for a task
// or a standing item — only their ids, which a page joins against the task
// index and the standing store it is already reading.

	// every call that went through the role registry and named itself at the
	// billing door, and empty on the rest, including every call a turn makes

	// [Seat] spells — reflex, low, worker, high, mastermind, judge, talk — derived at
	// the bank door ([TagUsage], [SeatOfRole], [SeatOfAgent]) and never typed
	// at a call site. It is the fact a spend page wants when it asks whether
	// the money went on the seat that does the work or the seat that thinks,
	// and it rides beside Role: a call the registry seated carries both, and
	// the tier's word stays true of a row whose model id is a fallback, a pin
	// or a rescue, because the seat names the chair the call ran in, not the
	// id that answered.
	//
	// IT IS omitempty LIKE EVERY ADDITIVE FIELD BEFORE IT, and a row without
	// one is a row nobody could seat: every row written before this field
	// existed, an errand that resolved its model outside the registry (a media
	// pin, a document reader, a tool ask), a receipt that arrived late. Empty
	// reads as "nobody said", which is the truth about it.

	Session string `json:"session,omitempty"`

	// IT IS THE ONE FIELD THAT MAKES A FAMILY ADDABLE. Session on a node's line
	// is the NODE's journal, which is a file nobody outside the family has heard
	// of, and Task is a small integer that restarts with every conversation; so
	// with those two alone, "what has this conversation's work cost so far"
	// could not be asked of this file at all — it could only be waited for,

	// family, at every depth and on the check and repair rounds as well, so a
	// reader that sums it gets the whole subtree.
	//
	// A FOLD STILL WRITES NO LINE, so a closed node's calls are counted here
	// exactly once — under the node that made them — and never again under the
	// conversation they were folded into.
	//
	// It is ADDITIVE, and absence is ordinary: every line written before this
	// field existed decodes without it, which reads as "this is not a family's
	// line", and every one of them is a conversation's or a standing item's.
	Root string `json:"root,omitempty"`
	// Standing is the id of the standing item whose firing made this call, and
	// empty everywhere else. A firing is InTask and may also carry a Task id;

	// they made long before they recognise the run it spawned.

	// ── what the lane that served it did (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, Decision 10)
	//
	// A model id is an address and the LANE is the machine behind it. One id is
	// served by a dozen endpoints that differ by 7× on the wait before the
	// first token and by 12× on how fast they write, at roughly the same price,
	// so a spending row that names only the model cannot answer the question a
	// person asks after a slow afternoon: was it the model, or was it the
	// machine we happened to be routed to. These five fields are that answer,
	// and they are the only ones in this struct that describe HOW rather than
	// HOW MUCH.
	//
	// EVERY ONE OF THEM IS omitempty AND EVERY ZERO MEANS "NOBODY SAID". A call
	// to an endpoint that is not a router names no lane; a call that was not
	// timed has no first-token figure; a call that was never hedged has no
	// waste. The emptiness law is the whole reason they can be added to a file
	// that already has a year of rows in it: an old row decodes with all five
	// absent, which reads as "not known", which is the truth about it.

	// Lane is the machine that answered, spelled exactly as the router spelled
	// it — the `provider` field of a streamed chunk. It is the vendor's own
	// name and it arrived from the wire; nothing in this build holds a list of
	// them.
	Lane string `json:"lane,omitempty"`
	// TTFTms is the wait before the first token, in milliseconds. It is the
	// half of a call's duration a person actually feels: the rest of the answer
	// arrives while they are reading.
	TTFTms int64 `json:"ttft_ms,omitempty"`
	// TPS is output tokens per second over the generation window — the first
	// token to the last, and NOT the whole call, because dividing an answer by
	// a duration that begins with a queue is how a warm lane behind a long
	// prompt gets recorded as a slow one.
	TPS float64 `json:"tps,omitempty"`
	// Hedged marks a call that was rescued: it went slow, a second request went
	// to another lane, and one of the two came back first. It is on the row
	// because a hedge is the one thing in this build that can spend money
	// twice, and a bill that cannot be told apart from an ordinary one is a
	// mechanism nobody can audit.
	Hedged bool `json:"hedged,omitempty"`
	// HedgeWasteUSD is what the LOSING half of that pair cost. Cancelling a
	// stream stops the billing on most lanes and on some it does not, so this
	// is zero on a clean rescue and a real figure on a lane that charged for
	// the tokens it had already written. It is the number the hedge budget is
	// judged on: the mechanism is worth having exactly while this stays small
	// beside the seconds it bought.

// between them would be a third place that has to agree about units, and the
// units are exactly where this has gone wrong before (a per-token price read as
// a per-million one). So: ttft and gen are durations, output is a token count,
// and the only arithmetic here is the one derivation — tokens per second over
// the generation window — which lives here so that two callers cannot compute
// it two ways.
//
// THE EMPTINESS LAW IS ENFORCED HERE RATHER THAN TRUSTED. A zero duration
// writes no first-token figure, an answer too short or too quick to rate writes
// no rate, and a hedge that wasted nothing writes no waste. That is what keeps
// an ordinary row exactly as wide as it was before lanes existed, and it is why
// a reader may take any figure that IS on a row as something somebody measured.

// ── WHAT ONE AGENT'S OWN CALL WAS SERVED BY ─────────────────────────────────
//
// The five fields above are known at two different moments and the row is
// written at the second. The first-token wait is known while the answer is
// still arriving, spread across chunks that reach the loop one at a time; the
// lane and the hedge are known when the answer lands, and the row goes out in
// that same breath ([Agent.addUsage]). So something has to hold what was seen
// ACROSS THE STREAM until the answer closes it, and that is the whole of what a
// witness is.
//
// IT BELONGS TO ONE AGENT AND IS FILLED ONLY BY THAT AGENT'S OWN REQUESTS.
// `internal/provider` folds every finished stream into a ledger keyed by MODEL
// and shared by every agent in this process ([provider.LastServed]), so reading
// a first-token wait back out of THAT would credit one conversation's lane to
// another conversation's row the moment two of them work at once — the invented
// measurement docs/ARCHITECTURE.md Decision 10 forbids. A witness cannot make
// that mistake, because nothing but this agent's own stream ever writes to it.
//
// AND IT HOLDS THE MOST RECENT ANSWER AND NOTHING ELSE, exactly as
