// A task's checker reads what would ship, but an absolute red on that tree does
// not say who made it red. This file supplies the missing other half: one
// bounded reading of the commit the task was cut from, shared by every task cut
// from that same commit, and a second reading of the landing only when the first
// one found something that needs subtracting.
