package session

// A WATCH THAT FIRES WAKES THE CONVERSATION, AND ONLY THE FIRING DOES.
//
// THE MEASURED SILENCE these cases are written from: a session watching
// `gh pr checks` for the checks to settle. The watch did its job — it saw the
// pending count go to zero — and its news rode the ambient lane, which waits for
// a turn boundary. There was no turn boundary coming: the person had walked
// away, and the conversation that had learned the checks were green sat there
// saying nothing until they came back and typed. A watch's LAST note is the
// answer to the question it was started for, and an answer nobody is ever asked
// for is not an answer.
//
// Both halves are tested, because half of this was always right: a periodic tick
// is telemetry with a complete log behind it and must stay quiet, and a turn per
// delta would turn a quiet observer into an autonomous conversation.
//
// Every case here drives the real watch loop rather than calling the lane's
// door. The tick-silence case releases acknowledged ticks through the wait seam;
// the other cases retain the real timer. The loop still decides which news a
// tick is, because a fixture that chose the lane would be testing the fixture.
