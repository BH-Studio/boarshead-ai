// NO READING OUTLIVES THE NODE THAT STARTED IT, AS TESTS (task_beside.go).
//
// Two halves. The runtime half pins what [besideWork.end] promises: the reading
// is cancelled and waited for, safely, however many roads call it. The structural
// half pins that every reading anybody starts HAS a join: a [beside] call whose
// result is never ended is a goroutine that runs past the node it was read for,
// and the next person to add a reading beside the work is the one this stops.
//
// And the rule the whole wave rests on, read off the source rather than trusted:
// the constructor of a task's worker makes no model call. It made one, for
// memory, and every worker a node built waited on it.
