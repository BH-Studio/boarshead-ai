// ── ONE WORD FOR WHAT A STEP IS DOING ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A caption says what is happening in a person's own words — "starting the local
// server", "reading the caption renderer". A surface that wants to draw ONE mark
// beside that sentence cannot get it from the sentence: the words are free-form
// on purpose, and a renderer that pattern-matched them would be a second, worse
// narrator built out of substring tests.
//
// So the narrator names its own family. It answers `run | starting the local
// server` — one word from a CLOSED list, a bar, and the same free sentence it
// always wrote — and this file owns that list, the parser that reads it, and the
// deterministic answer for when it is missing.
//
// THE LIST IS CLOSED AND THE SENTENCE IS NOT. Thirteen families cover the belt
// this build carries and leave one honest bucket for everything dynamic; the
// sentence stays whatever the model wanted to say. That split is the whole
// design: a fixed vocabulary is the only thing a glyph table can be keyed on,
// and free prose is the only thing worth reading.
//
// IT COSTS NO SECOND CALL. The category rides the caption narrator that already
// runs (caption.go) — same role, same bound of three per turn, same 500ms dwell,
// same 80-token ceiling. A classifier of its own would have been a second bill
// for a fact one already-paid-for sentence can carry as a prefix.
//
// AND A MISSING ONE IS NEVER AN ERROR. Every rung below the model is
// deterministic: [ActionCategoryForTool] answers from the tool's registered name
// alone, so a batch with no narration, a batch whose narration was malformed, and
// a conversation reopened from a file that predates this field all draw the same
// mark for the same work. Nothing retries and nothing is left blank.

import "strings"

// ActionCategory is the family of work one step belongs to. It is a string

// a number would have made an old surface's "3" mean whatever the thirteenth
// constant became.

// Each is a VERB A PERSON WOULD USE about work, never a machinery word: the
// families are what somebody watching would say is going on, which is the same
// bar every caption on this surface is held to.

// character and comes back whole — so a caption reads exactly as it would have
// before this format existed, and the mark comes from the tools.
//
// A LABEL ATTEMPT, THOUGH, IS CONSUMED WHATEVER BECOMES OF IT. One bare word
// before a bar is a model reaching for this format: `investigate | reading the
// renderer` gives back "reading the renderer" with no family, because leaving
// the word in would put machinery into the one line on the frame that may not
// carry any. The rule is narrow — ONE word, no spaces, at most [actionWordMax]
// characters — because a real five-to-ten-word caption never opens that way.

// AND AN ATTEMPT WITH NOTHING AFTER THE BAR IS REFUSED OUTRIGHT: both halves come
// back empty. `run |` is a model that produced the format and no sentence, and
// the two alternatives are both worse than nothing — handing back the raw line
// draws the label and the bar as though they were the work ("run |" on the
// frame), and handing back the family alone would put a mark beside a caption
// the narrator never actually replaced. Empty is the caller's signal to keep the
// deterministic composite already standing in the slot, which is a better line
