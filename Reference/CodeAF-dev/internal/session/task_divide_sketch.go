// THE SKETCH IS THE DIVISION PROPOSAL.
//
// A checkpoint mark asks a mastermind what is left of a running turn and gets one
// line of parts and arrows back (checkpoint.go). When that line has independent
// parts in it the turn is handed over, the drawing goes to the head of the
// worker's brief, and the task is armed to divide. Everything up to there was
// measured working: on the four-issue batch the reader said SPLIT at the first
// mark three times out of three, and it kept its nerve on small work four times
// out of four.
//
// AND THEN NOTHING HAPPENED. Every converted cell landed `parts=0`,
// `peak_workers=1`, and the worker's journal held not one mention of
// `divide_work`. A mastermind had already read the work and written the division
// down; the cheap worker that was handed it never reached for the verb — which is
// the same failure the chat side had for sixty-five cells before this road
// existed. HOPING A CHEAP MODEL RE-DERIVES A DIVISION SOMEBODY ELSE HAS ALREADY
// WRITTEN IS NOT A MECHANISM.
//
// ── SO THE HARNESS SUBMITS IT, AND THROUGH THE EXISTING ROAD ──
//
// This file builds a [divideArguments] out of the drawing and puts it to the same
// body `divide_work` reaches ([Agent.weighDivision], then [Agent.admitDivision]),
// with the node's own worker as the caller. Not a second spawning road, not a
// shortcut past anything:
//
//   - THE EVIDENCE GATE reads what a mastermind actually judged (see
//     [drawnDivision.evidence]), and refuses below the floor exactly as it always
//     did.
//   - THE TIEBREAK still fires only where a model's reading of breadth armed this
//     work, which is precisely the case a mark's split creates — four whole issues
//     enumerate nothing a counter can see, so the division reaches the reviewer by
//     the road Lane J built for it.
//   - THE CAPACITY GATE still refuses to divide what nobody is free to pick up.
//   - THE REVIEWER still reads the parts together and may amend, merge or refuse
//     them, and A REFUSAL IS THE WHOLE ANSWER: the task runs as one worker, which
//     is what it was already doing. Nothing is cancelled and nothing is lost.
//   - THE PARENT STAYS. The parts are admitted under the node while its worker is
//     still reading, so the runner's tail loop finds children outstanding when the
//     worker's own turn ends, holds the node open, and folds every report into it
//     (task_child_run.go's [childRun.foldParts]) — which is the same coordinating
//     state a worker that called the verb mid-run lands in, reached by the same
//     code rather than by a second version of it.
//
// ── BESIDE THE WORKER, NEVER IN FRONT OF IT ──
//
// WHAT WAS TRUE: the drawing was put before the worker's first request, and the
// worker waited for the whole of the reading. On node 5 of conversation
// de9eabcb10cc1e45 that reading was two hundred and nineteen seconds of one model
// thinking — a stream that produced tokens the whole time and so was never cut —
// and the worker's first request went out four minutes and eighteen seconds after
// the turn that handed the work over had ended. The person saw a new card with a
// clock on it and nothing else.
//
// WHAT IS TRUE NOW: the reading starts when the worker is built, beside it
// (task_beside.go), and the worker's first request goes out at once on the brief
// it would have had anyway — the drawing at its head included. The same model is
// asked the same question about the same parts; only when it is asked has moved.
// When the answer lands ([Agent.deliverBeside]):
//
//   - PARTS: they are admitted exactly as before, and the receipt goes onto the
//     worker's own queue, so it reads it at its next step. A worker whose turn has
//     already ended parks on the parts like any worker that handed work out, and
//     reads the receipt with their reports.
//   - A REFUSAL, OR NOBODY TO ASK: nothing happens. The worker is already doing
//     the work as one worker, which is what a refusal always meant.
//   - WORK NO WORKER CAN DO: the worker is stopped — the one case where a started
//     worker is interrupted, and a rare one — and the node lands on the person
//     with the reader's own sentence, keeping whatever the worker wrote
//     ([Agent.landNeedsPerson]).
//   - AND IF THE WORKER HAS ALREADY SAID ITS LAST WORD, OR HANDED WORK OUT OF ITS
//     OWN ACCORD, the answer is dropped and written down as dropped. Parts admitted
//     under a worker that will never read again would be parts nobody folds, and a
//     second division laid over one the worker already made would be two answers
//     to one question.
//
// THE LAST CASE IS DECIDED UNDER THE LOCK THE RUNNER'S TAIL READS ITS NEWS UNDER.
// The tail decides the worker is finished by reading "is any part still out, is
// any report still owed" as one fact ([Agent.taskNewsStanding]), and the answer is
// admitted, or dropped, under that same hold. So there is no instant in which the
// tail has decided the worker is done and the parts are being admitted anyway:
// either the parts exist when the tail looks, and it folds them, or the tail has
// already withdrawn the worker from its room, and the reading sees that and drops.
//
// WHAT THIS COSTS, SAID PLAINLY. On a drawing the reader approves, the worker has
// spent the length of the reading on work that is then handed to parts; they
// start from its copy of the folder as it stood at that moment, so what it wrote is
// on their disk rather than lost, and the parts start exactly when they started
// before — the reading was always in front of them. On every drawing the reader
// refuses, or cannot be asked about, the worker has had the whole of the reading
// to work in instead of waiting through it.
//
// ── AND THE WORKER IS TOLD, IN THE WORDS IT WOULD HAVE READ ANYWAY ──
//
// A worker that called the verb reads [divisionDone] as its tool result. A worker
// the harness divided for reads THE SAME SENTENCES on its queue, under one line of
// the harness's own ([divisionHandedOutBeside]): what was handed out, that it
// must not wait for the parts, and that the work is not finished until it has
// made one deliverable out of their reports. Writing a second wording for the same
// fact is how the two paths would come to mean different things.

// legendSegments cuts the legend into the clauses that name one letter each.
//
// THE ASK IS WHAT DECIDES THE SHAPE OF THIS. It says "one sentence saying what
// each letter is" ([checkpointSketchAsk]), and what a model writes for that is
// one sentence with the letters separated by commas — "A is the validation
// workflow, B is the docs sweep, C is the release notes" — or, about as often, a
// line apiece. So punctuation is the first cut and nothing cleverer: a parser
// that tried to understand the sentence would be a second reading of an answer
// whose whole value is that it was cheap.
//
// AND THE LABEL ITSELF IS THE SECOND CUT, which punctuation alone missed. The
// legend on task 1 of conversation 57d51779f63ac603 read
//
//	**A:** read `seam.start` in `cmd/codeaf/chatv3.go` … **B:** trace the
//	folder-pick path — `folderConfirm` in `folderact.go` → … **C:** …
//
// on ONE line with no separator between the clauses. A's clause swallowed the
// whole of it, B and C matched nothing, and the parts went out called "read
// seam.start in" and "part 2" — the second being [sketchName]'s answer for a
// letter the legend never named, about a letter the legend named perfectly well.
// A label opening a clause is a boundary wherever it stands, so it is one here:
// see [legendInlineLabel] for the four spellings.
