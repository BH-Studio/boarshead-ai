// THE FAMILY TREE OF A FOLDER FAMILY IS A REPOSITORY.
//
// ── WHAT THIS REPAIRS ──
//
// A task family is a claim on one body of material, worked in one workspace of
// record, whose product is reintegrated into the material. For a repository
// ground that abstraction has always been real: a part is a worktree cut off
// the family tree and its branch merges back into it. For a PLAIN FOLDER —
// research notes, a document sweep, a data directory, a report with a section
// per region, which is most general work — it was not real at all. The parts of
// a mirrored parent fell through to the parent's own directory and worked on top
// of each other, concurrently, with no isolation and no merge, while both
// prompts promised each of them "a copy of the repository taken from yours".
//
// So the mirror — the private copy of the folder this session already makes at
// family start (task_run.go's [mirrorGround], groundladder.go's [copyRung]) —
// is opened as a repository of its own the moment it is made. It is harness-
// owned space; nothing of this reaches the person's folder, which is still laid
// by name at the family's landing ([taskTree.landMirror]).
//
// ── WHY THAT IS THE WHOLE CHANGE ──
//
// ONE ROAD, AND NO SECOND MERGE PATH. Once the mirror is a repository, a part
// of a mirrored parent takes the roads that already exist, end to end, with
// nothing written for it: the part's workspace IS the mirror, so the ground
// ladder resolves it to the repository it is standing in (taskstands.go's
// [Agent.groundLadder], which holds a part to where its parent stands), the
// mode falls out as [TaskModeWorktree], [prepareTaskTreeOn] cuts the worktree
// at [taskOwnFolder] off the mirror's HEAD, and [taskTree.comeHome] commits the
// part's ledger and merges that branch back into the mirror exactly as it merges
// a repository part into the person's checkout. The audit reaches it too: a part
// has a branch, so it is judged from a clean checkout of that branch
// (task_audit.go's [restoreFromBranch]), and the parent is still judged against
// the untouched folder with the integrated mirror's work laid over it.
//
// AND THE FAMILY'S MID-RUN CHECKPOINT REACHES IT ON THE SAME ROAD. A parent
// about to hand its work out commits its ledger onto the family branch first, so
// that the parts branch from a HEAD holding it (task_divide_wip.go) — and the
// moment the mirror is a repository, a folder family has a family branch for
// that commit to go on. Underneath it the snapshot rung still seals whatever a
// ledger cannot name (groundladder.go's [sealGroundWork], [taskTree.replayOwnWork]).
//
// ── WHERE THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT GO ──
//
// IN PLACE AND FOLDER FAMILIES ARE OUT OF SCOPE, and that is a ruling rather
// than an omission. Those two modes are the honest un-isolations: the person
// said "here", or there was nowhere else to stand, so the family tree IS the
// person's own directory. There is no private copy to open, and initialising a
// repository in somebody's folder to gain one would be the harness putting its
// own machinery where they live. Parts of such a parent go on sharing the
// directory, which is what "here" means.

// their worktrees off, and hands the tree back either way.
//
// IT NEVER FAILS THE TASK. A ground with no git, a read-only disk, a folder
// somebody moved — none of them are a reason to refuse work that ran perfectly
// well before this file existed. What they are is a reason to SAY SO: the tree
// comes back carrying one sentence ([taskTree.note]) that the job log prints and
// the parent's own brief carries, because a parent that is about to hand out
// parts is the one who has to know they will be working beside it rather than
// each in a copy of their own. Degrading in silence is how the defect this file
// repairs went unnoticed for as long as it did.
