// THE PERSON NAMED A PROGRAM: what a proposal meets when the person's own
// message said which program codeaf carries should do the work.
//
// A PROMPT IS REMEMBERED EXACTLY AS OFTEN AS THE MODEL REMEMBERS IT. The
// hand-off page says a program the person asks for is used (delegate_door.go's
// [delegateFact]), and a model that has just read a long issue and decided it
// is a task writes the proposal it always writes, with no `via`. So the
// person's words are read here, in code, for the names of the programs this
// build carries, and two things follow from them that cost no prompt bytes:
//
//   - A proposal with no `via` is turned back ONCE for the message that named
//     a program, with a sentence saying which program was named and both ways
//     to answer it. The next proposal the model makes after reading that
//     passes as it is, which is how "fix it with senior-dev" and "don't use
//     senior-dev for this" both come out right: which of the two the person
//     said is read by the model, from words code cannot weigh.
//   - A proposal whose `via` is the program the person asked for is never too
//     small. The spawn floor (spawnfloor.go) keeps a one-file fix in the
//     conversation, and a person who typed "fix this file with senior-dev" has
//     overruled it already, exactly as a person who typed `/task` has.
//
// THE TWO READ THE WORDS DIFFERENTLY, because they are wrong at different
// prices. A bounce the person did not mean costs one round trip, and the model
// that reads it can answer "did not mean the program", so it hears any mention
// of the name ([Config.programNamedIn]). A floor lifted that the person did not
// mean starts a billed run that cannot do what they asked, and nothing reads
// it again, so it hears only the words that ask for the program
// ([Config.programsAskedIn]), and never lifts a commit, an undo or a revert.
//
// AND THE PERSON'S WORDS ARE EVERY MESSAGE OF THE TURN, not the newest one
// ([programsHeard]): a steer typed while the model reads the code names
// nothing, and it does not unsay the program the turn opened by asking for.
//
// ONLY WHERE A `via` COULD BE HONOURED. Inside a task, with no run road, or
// with no program carried, a `via` is refused anyway ([Agent.stageTask]), and a
// bounce there would be a round trip that ends where it began.

// numbers what the person has typed, steering included, and the bounce is
// counted against the newest message of the turn that named one
// ([programsHeard]): a new message of theirs that names the program again
// earns one more bounce, a steer that names nothing earns none and does not
// unsay the one before it, and a woken turn, which types nothing, inherits the
// count of the message it is still answering.
//
// AND A PROPOSAL PASSES ONLY ONCE THE MODEL HAS READ THE BOUNCE, which is never
// in the step that made it. A model reads a result in the request after the
// batch that returned it, and every proposal of one message is staged before
// any of their results is read: side by side in the batch, or while the
// message is still arriving. "fix issues #31 and #32 with senior-dev" is two
// proposals in one message, and the second used to pass as though the first
// one's bounce had been read, go up with no `via`, and be admitted to codeaf's
// own worker by its countdown. So the mark carries the step that made it
// ([Agent.stepSeq]), every proposal without a `via` in that step is turned back
// too, and it is a proposal from a later step that passes as it is. The check
