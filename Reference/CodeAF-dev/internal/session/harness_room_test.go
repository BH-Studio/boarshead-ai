// WHAT A PERSON SEES WHEN THEY WALK INTO A DESIGN.
//
// A design node is a room like any other node's, and for a while it was the one
// room in this build with nobody talking in it: the designer's whole stream was
// observed privately, one throttled status line escaped to the chat, and the
// room a person opened to WATCH the page being written showed that line
// scrolling in place for two minutes and then a finished card.
//
// THE FIX FOR THAT WAS ONCE THE OPPOSITE MISTAKE, and these tests hold the line
// between them. The designer's reply is a JSON envelope, so a room handed the
// content deltas showed a wall of braces — and a journal handed the same text
// replayed that wall to whoever opened the design tomorrow. What the room gets
// live is the THINKING, over the replacing progress row the chat already draws
// off the same stream, and each stage's MILESTONE the moment it closes — in a
// person's words, with the card in a fence so markdown leaves its columns
// alone. The journal keeps the same milestones, so live watching and reading
// back tomorrow are the same story; the envelope itself reaches neither.

// THE ROOM HEARS THE DESIGNER THINK AND NEVER SEES IT TYPE. The reasoning is

// content is the page's own JSON, and the live account of THAT is the replacing
// progress row (harness_build.go's harnessProgress) — the only text that
// crosses is each stage's finished MILESTONE, in a person's words, so the one
// person actually watching reads the draft note and its card the moment the
// draft passes rather than on their next visit ([designSeat.noted]).
