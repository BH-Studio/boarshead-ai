// THE LAW: A CONVERSATION MAY STOP WITHOUT DELEGATING WHEN THE ONLY THING LEFT
// IS THE ENDING OF AN OPERATION IT ALREADY OWNS — AND IT SAYS WHICH ONE.
//
// A turn that has finished every artifact the person asked for and is left only
// waiting on a command it started has nothing a worker could be given: a cold
// worker cannot wait on a job in somebody else's registry. The stopped-turn door
// already knows this ([Agent.turnIsWaitingOnItsOwnWork]); the running-turn
// handover door could not see it, and made a task out of the wait. The measured
// cell is written up in the review under docs/design/conversation-runtime.
//
// The runtime knows WHICH operations are outstanding and cannot know whether the
// rest of the request is done, so the dowry ask the handover already makes
// ([checkpointHandoffAsk]) offers this conversation's own live operations, and
// the model may answer one exact line naming the ones it is waiting for. This is
// not a new model call, not a reading of prose, and not a running-job exemption:
// a live operation on its own suppresses nothing, and a remainder with real work
// in it is handed over exactly as before.
