// A TURN WAITING ON THE WORLD IS WAITING, AND CARRYING ON HAS A CEILING.
//
// THE MEASURED FAILURE these cases are written from: 2026-08-31,
// 15:36:25–15:41:45Z. A conversation was waiting for GitHub's checks on two pull
// requests with a watch of its own running over `gh pr checks`. Every turn ended
// by saying exactly that — "the watch (job 5) fires when the pending count
// settles; nothing actionable until then" — and the end-of-turn reader, which can
// only answer done, stop or carry on, answered carry on, because the ask really
// was not finished. Twenty carry-ons in five minutes, each one a reader call and
// another poll of the very command that was going to report, until the ceiling
// converted the wait into a task whose acceptance nobody could ever fail.
//
// Two rules close it, and both are read here through [Agent.Submit] rather than
// by calling the gate: what the measurement was about is what a whole turn costs.

// about whether the sleep outlived the turn. The two fields that are not status
// are what Close needs to let go of it at once: a stop function so the signal
