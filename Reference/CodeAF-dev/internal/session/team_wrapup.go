// ── WRAP UP FIRST: THE MANAGER'S CLOSING REPORT ─────────────────────────────
//
// The ruling (c-9): a person closing a team with work running picks `Wrap up
// first` by default. The interface appends the one request teams' wrapup.go
// defines ([teams.WrapUpRequest]: a directive from `you` to `manager` whose
// State is [teams.StateWrapUp]) to the team's Traffic, and nothing else: the
// two sides meet only there.
//
// THE MANAGER'S SIDE, here:
//
//   - Its delivery hands it the request as an instruction ([wrapUpLine]):
//     tell every member to finish and commit (team_send, directive), answer
//     what it can of what they ask, start nothing new, then write the closing
//     report with `team_close_report` (done, left, where the files are). The
//     request wakes an idle manager like a member's reply does.
//   - The report is a [teams.PacketClosing] packet to the person with the
//     team's spend today, options `Close` and `Keep going`, and a
//     recommendation. The team closes only when the person picks `Close`
//     ([teams.AcceptClosing], which the interface calls on the click and this
//     side calls again on reading the decision; it is idempotent).
//   - IT IS BOUNDED, by [wrapUpFor] and by [wrapUpSpendUSD] of the team's
//     spend since the request. Past either, with no report, codeaf raises the
//     packet itself, marked `wrap-up incomplete`, with `Close now` and `Keep
//     going` ([Agent.teamWrapUpDue]). The clock is looked at by the traffic
//     watch every tick, running or idle, and costs nothing while no wrap-up is
//     in progress.
//
// THE CLOCK IS ON THE TEAM, in teams.json ([teams.Wrap]): the start and the
// bound it was given. A manager that restarts in the middle of one reads it
// back ([Agent.teamWrapUpResume]) and keeps the time that is left. One
// already past its bound raises the incomplete report on that start, once,
// the same way a live clock would have. The person's card still offers
// `Close now` either way (the interface's own road).
