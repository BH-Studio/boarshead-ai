// ── THE RESPONSE BOUNDARY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This file is the ONE place in this package that asks what a bad response
// meant. Everything else — the turn loop, the errand ladder, the node runner,
// the gate — calls a function here and does what the verdict says.
//
// A STRUCTURAL TEST HOLDS THAT LINE (taxonomy_law_test.go). It fails if
// [taxonomy.Classify] is called anywhere else in the package, and it fails if
// either of the two functions that BUY A STRONGER MODEL — [Agent.nextNodeModel]
// and [Agent.repairModel] — is called from outside this file. That is not
// tidiness: the failure this whole mechanism exists for was three sites each
// answering the same question its own way, and a fourth site added next year
// would do it again unless something says no.
//
// ── WHAT WAS WRONG BEFORE ──
//
// A task worker rolled four consecutive HTTP 400s — "provider returned error",
// one endpoint after another, the arguments of a tool call arriving as
// unterminated JSON. The turn gave up, the node's run ended with a provider
// error, and task_run.go read that as THE MODEL being unable to answer and moved
// the node onto the next rung of the fallback chain: a new worker, a new
// journal, a model seven times the price, and no road back down. On three runs
// of a measured five-run comparison that was 57–82% of the whole bill; the run
// that never happened to roll four bad responses in a row cost $2.33.
//
// Nothing about who served a request is evidence about who was asked. That
// sentence is the mechanism.

// failureLimits is the boundary's three numbers, resolved once per agent from
// the person's profile (config.ResponseLimitsAt).
//
// ONCE, because resolving reads the profile file and this is asked on the
// failure path of every request — and because a number that could change between
// two attempts of one ladder is a ladder nobody can reason about afterwards.
func (a *Agent) failureLimits() taxonomy.Limits {
	a.limitsOnce.Do(func() {
		a.limits = config.ResponseLimitsAt(a.config.ProfileDir).Floored()
		// AND RESOLVING THEM PUBLISHES THE PERSON'S PATIENCE, because this is the
		// one place in the build that reads `response.attempts` and the two
		// places that build a deadline cannot read a profile at all (lane's
		// [lane.UsePatience], and internal/provider's dispatcher under it). It is
		// stated here rather than hidden inside the resolver so that "who told
		// the deadline how patient to be" has one answer and one line.
		lanes.UsePatience(a.limits.Patience)
	})
	return a.limits
}

// tallyFor is the [taxonomy.Tally] one node keeps, minted on first ask.
//
// It is keyed by node id on the OWNER rather than held on the node, so the
// graph's own struct stays what it is and a node nothing ever classified simply
// has no entry. Every worker this agent builds for that node — the run, each
// repair round — is handed the same pointer, which is what makes "the wire
// failures under this round" a fact the gate can read.

//

// refusal door and handed over whole ([provider.Evidence]). What this adds is
// what the adapter cannot know: that a stream guard cut, that a deadline fired,
// and that a tool call's arguments did not survive.
//
// NO PATTERN LIST DECIDES ANYTHING. [isRetryable] is still asked, and it is
// still the harness's one list of what a bare socket failure looks like — but it
// sets a FACT ([taxonomy.Evidence.Wire]) rather than an outcome, which is the
