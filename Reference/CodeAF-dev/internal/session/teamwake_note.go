// ── THE SENTENCE A TEAM WAKE OPENS WITH, WRITTEN ONCE ───────────────────────
//
// A turn woken by team traffic starts on a note the session writes
// (team_wakewatch.go): a sentence telling the model that nobody typed this,
// then what arrived. The sentence is for the model. The live conversation
// never draws it (tui3's followup.go), and a surface that draws a transcript
// asks [TeamWakeNote] to leave it out the same way, so the wall's tiles and a
// reopened conversation show what the live one shows. The composers use these
// constants, so the reader can never drift from what was written.

	// replies.

	// still hold it.
