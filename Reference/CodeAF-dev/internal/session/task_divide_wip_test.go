// THE FAMILY'S WORLD, AS TESTS (issue #232).
//
// Two claims, and every test here drives the real doors for them — the real
// `divide_work`, the real frontier starting the parts, the real
// [prepareTaskTreeOn] preparing their working copies, the real landing merging
// their branches home:
//
//  1. A parent that has written something and then divides puts that work ON THE
//     FAMILY BRANCH, so every part wakes up with it on disk and the family's own
//     history says so.
//  2. Every part starts from THAT ONE COMMIT, however far apart their working
//     copies were prepared and however much the parent wrote in between.
//
// What is scripted is only the provider. The parts are real workers on a real
// graph, and they land through the branch road a repository part has always
// landed on.
