// WHERE A TASK STANDS, AND WHAT THAT MAKES TRUE.
//
// ── THE BREACH THIS WAS WRITTEN FROM ──
//
// A conversation opened in the person's home directory handed out two tasks
// against a repository somewhere else. The brief named that repository by its
// full path, so both workers ran
//
//	cd /Users/…/code/agentfield && git checkout -b fix/…
//
// and the guard next door (taskgit.go) answered with the sentence it has always
// answered `checkout` with: "this is your own copy of the repository and it
// reaches no remote… what you write here comes home on its own." Every clause of
// that was false about the path the command named. It was the person's live
// checkout, it has a remote, and nothing written there comes home by any road at
// all.
//
// A refusal that is false about the thing it refuses does not stop the work; it
// tells the model that the harness has misunderstood, and a model that believes
// that goes around. These two went around three times — `git commit-tree` and
// `git write-tree` to build the commit by hand, then `GIT_DIR=…/.git git
// update-ref`, and finally the whole Git Data API through `gh api` (blob → tree →
// commit → ref) and a pull request. Two commits landed on a branch of the
// person's own repository, from work nobody had approved landing there.
//
// ── THE LAW, IN ONE SENTENCE ──
//
// A TASK MAY READ THE WHOLE MACHINE AND MAY WRITE IN ONE DIRECTORY. That
// directory is its GROUND ([taskGroundDir]), and the whole of the difference
// between this file and taskgit.go is the question each of them answers:
// taskgit.go asks WHOSE WORK a command would take, which is a question about
// refs; this asks WHERE a command is aimed, which is a question about paths. The
// breach above needed both, because the first guard, asked the wrong question,
// gave a true answer to it about somewhere it had never looked.
//
// Reading is untouched, deliberately and by name: `read`, `grep`, `ls`, `cat`,
// and `git log`, `show`, `diff`, `status` against any repository on the machine
// all pass. A task briefed about a repository it is not standing in still has to
// be able to look at it, and looking has never been what goes wrong.
//
// ── AND THE ROAD HOME IS NOT A REMOTE ──
//
// The same run reached for `git push` and `gh pr create`, which are not a path
// question at all: they are a task deciding to LAND its own work, by a road that
// is not the one its work comes home on. A node's deliverable is merged by the
// landing (task_run.go's comeHome) and a pull request is the person's to open —
// so both are refused wherever the task is standing, with a sentence that says
// where the work actually goes rather than one about directories.
//
// ── WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE, SAID PLAINLY ──
//
// It reads the paths a command NAMES. `cd elsewhere && python fix.py`, where the
// script writes what it likes, passes — a guard that claimed otherwise would be
// claiming a guarantee it cannot keep (orchestrate.go's writeGuard says the same
// about the write scope). What it does close is every shape that names its
// target: the hands that take a path, a redirection, and git aimed by `cd`,
// `-C`, `--git-dir`, `--work-tree` or the environment.
