// The recovery tests are deliberately split the way the executor's are
// (task_test.go): [TestTaskRecovery…Interrupt…] drives the whole agent, because
// "the process died and the branch is still there" is not a claim a stub can
// make, and the frontier half is driven with a scripted runner, because
// "recovery is load, reconcile, continue" is a scheduling law and should be
