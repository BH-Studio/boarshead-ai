// THE STANDING GATE ON "WHO IS THIS ADDRESSED TO".
//
// The failure this whole road exists to close is not a bug in a function; it is
// a SENTENCE ADDRESSED TO SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT THERE. Nothing in a compiler
// notices that, and nothing in a review reliably notices it either — the
// sentence reads perfectly, and it reads perfectly on the one kind of session
// where it is a dead end. So the two facts a reviewer would have to hold in
// their head are held here instead, and a build fails when either moves.
//
// The two tests below are deliberately dumb: one counts the doors, the other
// counts the sentences. Neither tries to decide whether a road is CORRECT, and
// neither could; what they enforce is that a road cannot appear, or a
// person-addressed sentence be written, without somebody having said in this
// file where the principal comes into it.

// wakeRoads are every function in this package that may put a message on the
// steering queue the model OWES AN ANSWER FOR — the wake, which is the only
// mechanism by which this engine says anything to whoever is out there when no
// turn is running.
//
// EACH ENTRY SAYS HOW THAT ROAD REACHES THE PRINCIPAL. Adding one without an
// entry fails this test, and the entry is the place the author has to answer
// the question in words. "It does not need to" is a legitimate answer and two
// of these give it.
