package session

// The guardian: a small model asked whether one call is plainly safe, before
// the person is asked at all.
//
// It sits inside the consent path (consent.go) at exactly one point — after the
// policy has said PROMPT and after the session memo has had its say, before the
// question reaches a person — and it can only ever do one thing: turn a prompt
// into an allow. It cannot deny, it cannot widen an allow, and it never sees a
// call the policy already refused. That asymmetry is the whole safety argument:
// the worst a broken, confused or adversarially-prompted guardian can do is fail
// to save somebody a keystroke, and every path that does not end in the single
// word ALLOW ends exactly where it ended before this file existed.
//
// ── WHY IT IS OFF BY DEFAULT ──
//
// A gate that answers for the person must be opted into. The setting
// (approval.guardian) defaults to off, and with it off nothing here runs: no
// call, no cost, no branch. "The model asked, so a model decided" is a sentence
// somebody has to have agreed to in advance, in writing, in a file they can read
// back — which is what a settings row is.
//
// ── WHY THE PROMPT IS THE SHAPE IT IS ──
//
// One tool, its arguments, the rule that matched, and a binary contract. No
// conversation, no transcript, no memory: the guardian must judge THE CALL, and
// a guardian that could read the session would be a guardian the session can
// talk into things. The arguments are clipped because a judgement about a
// 300KB write is made in its first lines, and because a gate is not a place to
// spend a context window.
//
// ── WHERE IT DOES NOT RUN ──
//
// The early-start law (loop.go) consults the POLICY only, so a call the guardian
// would vouch for still waits for the batch rather than starting while the
// response streams. That is deliberate: an early start is thrown away on a
// retry, and paying for a guardian call per discarded attempt would be spending
// money to save a keystroke that was never going to be asked for.

// a refusal to answer, an explanation, an empty reply, a model that has decided
// to be helpful in prose — lands on ASK.

Answer ALLOW only if this specific call is plainly safe: read-only, inside the working directory, and reversible.

Answer ASK for anything that deletes, overwrites, sends, publishes, installs, or reaches outside the working directory — and for anything you are unsure about, cannot read, or would need to guess about.

When in doubt, ASK. Answer with the single word and nothing else.`

// guardianAllows reports whether the guardian vouched for this call.
//
// FALSE IS THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING THAT IS NOT A CLEAR YES: the guardian is
// off, no model can be resolved, the provider failed, the turn was interrupted,
// the reply was anything other than the word. Each of those is a fall-through to
// the person on the caller's side, which is the behavior with no guardian at
// all.
//
// It rides the TURN's context, so Interrupt ends a pending guardian call on the
// same beat it ends everything else, and the blocked tool refuses the way an
// interrupted consent question already refuses.
// guardianAnswerWindow is how long the stand-in gets to say one word. It is

// no question on screen behind it, so every second past this one is a turn that
// looks hung to the person watching it.

	// it. THIS IS THE ONE NAMED EXCEPTION IN THE BUILD, and the reason is that
	// there is nothing to run beside it and nothing it could be applied to
	// afterwards — it decides whether the tool RUNS, so a verdict that arrived
	// after the command had already executed would not be a safety gate, it would
	// be a receipt. It keeps its ten seconds.
