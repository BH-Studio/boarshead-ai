package session

// THE SESSION OWNS THE READING OF ITS OWN RECORD.
//
// A conversation's own surface never touches the file: it asks the agent holding
// it for [Agent.Transcript] and draws what comes back. A page watching ANOTHER
// agent's work had no such door — the record it wants belongs to a node whose
// agent is somebody else's, and there was nothing to ask — so the view grew a
// second reader of its own: its own line struct, its own scanner, its own idea
// of which roles exist, and hand-copied duplicates of two display caps this
// package does not export.
//
// That is one record with two readings, and the two drifted exactly where a
// second reading always drifts: the view's knew `user`, `assistant` and two
// spellings of thinking and nothing else, so a line the session had MARKED — a
// correction typed into running work, a sentence the session itself wrote —
// reopened as an ordinary question from the person. Yesterday's correction read
// as a second brief.
//
// So the doors below. They are the same rebuild a resume does and the same
// shaping [Agent.Transcript] answers with, pointed at a file nobody has open:
//
//	ONE RECORD, ONE READING. A page and a conversation shape the same journal
//	through the same code, so a mark this package writes cannot be a mark a
//	surface fails to know about.
//
// ── WHAT THEY DELIBERATELY DO NOT DO ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// THEY DO NOT REPAIR. [replaySessionFile] mends a transcript that is about to be
// SENT — an unanswered trailing batch is a 400 on every request after it — and
// that repair would delete the one shape a page opened on live work exists to
// draw: the call the record names with no result under it yet. A reader that
// only draws wants the record as written ([DisplayEntry.Answered]).
//
// THEY DO NOT CLAIM THE FILE. No lock is taken and nothing is written: the
// journal belongs to whoever is filling it in, and a page is a spectator.
//
// THEY DO NOT FAIL. A path that is empty or missing is not an error and answers
// nothing — the record is EVIDENCE, not a prerequisite, and a page that refused
// to open because a file was not there yet would refuse to show the live work
// beside it as well.
//
// BUT A SHORT READING IS NEVER A SILENT ONE. Two files come back with less than
// they hold: one whose line this build cannot get past, which answers with
// EVERYTHING ABOVE THAT LINE, and one written by a NEWER codeaf, which a resume
// refuses outright and which answers here with nothing at all. Returning either
// as an ordinary short record would be the page saying, in the only way a page
// can, that this is all the work there ever was. So the reading carries what it
// could not do ([Record.Unreadable]) and the page draws it.
//
// THEY DO NOT OPEN A PICTURE'S FILE. The parts come back as references to where
// the bytes were ([journalPart.reference]) and never as the bytes: these
// messages are shaped for display and thrown away, a room re-reads on every
// open and a run page four times a second, and on a hosted record the paths
// belong to another machine entirely.

// for an open agent: `Entries` is [Agent.Transcript] and `Earlier`/`Floor` are
// [EarlierHistory], with the same contract between them — THE RECORD, TOLD ONCE
// AND WHOLE, IS `Earlier` FOLLOWED BY `Entries[Floor:]`.
//
// The region is here rather than left out because a page that dropped it would
// be showing a person the pass's own shortened copy of their work as though it
// were the work: the calls above the marker come back as stubs, and the prose
// comes back as one folded line. THE LENS MAY LOWER SALIENCE; IT MAY NOT DROP A
// FACT (docs/design/lens/DESIGN.md).
//
// Earlier is empty, and Floor zero, for every record that was never compacted —
// which is nearly all of them — and for one compacted by a build that did not
// write the window's length, where the region cannot be placed and is dropped

	// [SteerMark.Landing] is one: the fact belongs to whoever did the reading,

// than by a second parser of the same file.

// jump for a sentence nobody on the page wrote.
