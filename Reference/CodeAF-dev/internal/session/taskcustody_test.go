// CUSTODY, ON THE ROAD (issue #567).
//
// The measured run is one sentence: a turn was moved to a task, and the brief it
// was moved on told the worker to wait for two pieces THIS conversation was
// holding, integrate their branches, and open the pull request. A task admitted
// by this road is a root, and `tasks` inside a task answers only that task's own
// children, so the worker's first look at the rail answered "No tasks have run in
// this project yet." and every minute after that was spent guessing branch names.
//
// checkpoint_custody.go states the law and its two readings. THESE ARE THE ROAD
// TESTS: a scripted turn, driven through the seam the real incident came out of,
// with two pieces genuinely out in the graph while it runs — because the whole
// question is what the ENGINE'S OWN LEDGER says at the moment the brief is
// written, and a unit over a sketch cannot ask it.
//
// The fourth test is the control and it is the point of the other three: the same
// drawing, over a conversation holding NOTHING, converts exactly as it did before
// any of this existed. A refusal bought by turning the road off is worth nothing.
