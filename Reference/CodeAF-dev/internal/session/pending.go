// A GATE IS A QUESTION ON EVERY SURFACE.
//
// ── THE RUN THIS WAS WRITTEN FROM ──
//
// A nested part — task 3, two levels down — landed needing somebody's look. Its
// journal read "no answer in 5m0s, so nothing was accepted". A fifteen-second
// capture of the whole run shows NO ANSWERS ROW FOR THAT NODE, EVER: the gate
// expired without a person ever being able to see it, let alone answer it.
// Meanwhile the roster's footer counted the node under `done` while its parent
// was still working.
//
// ── THE LAW ──
//
// A QUESTION TO A PERSON IS NEVER ON A TIMER. It waits, visibly, on every
// surface, until it is answered — or it is not a question. A timer may expire
// only into a state that says UNANSWERED, never into accepted or rejected. And a
// parent's running is A FOLD, NOT A MUTE: the family head carries the demand,
// and no count ever says done about a node nobody has decided.
//
// ── ONE REGISTRY, MANY RENDERERS ──
//
// This file owns the registry and nothing else renders from anywhere else. It is
// DERIVED rather than stored, and that is deliberate: a second list of which
// nodes are waiting would be a second source of truth for a fact the graph
// already holds, and the two would disagree the first time a node was resolved
// on a road that forgot to remove it. Entry and exit are therefore free — a node
// is on the list exactly while its state is [TaskUnverified], which is exactly
// while nobody has said whether its work holds.
//
// AND IT IS DEPTH-INDEPENDENT, which is the whole defect. A part two levels down
// is a decision somebody has to make in exactly the way a root is; that its
// parent was the one being asked while it ran changes WHO is asked, never
// WHETHER anybody is.

// principal's answer about what a session should do next, and this is a question
// put to a person about work that has already happened.
//
// It carries the node's whole notice rather than a handful of fields lifted out
// of it, because every surface that renders a decision already knows how to draw
// a notice — the card, the roster row, the room's foot — and a second shape
// would be a second thing to keep in step with the first.
