// THE TWO OR THREE WORDS A PIECE OF WORK IS CALLED.
//
// A node's title is what every surface that draws work draws: the rail's column,
// the home card's work band, the tasks list on a phone, the header of the card
// that lands. The rail is twenty-four columns wide, so what it actually shows is
// the first three words of that title ([taskTitleOf], internal/tui3) — and until
// this file existed, four of the five doors into the graph put a RAW SENTENCE
// there for those three words to be cut out of:
//
//	/task with no shaper   the person's own first eight words   "read /Users…"
//	the route judge        the judge's goal, first line          "Look into why the…"
//	an adaptive run's root the goal, first line                  "/var/folders/j7/…"
//	a resumed node         whatever the checkpoint kept of those
//
// Three words off the front of a sentence is not a name. It is whatever the
// sentence happened to open with — how somebody cleared their throat, or the
// path they pasted — so a column of them names every piece of work after its
// first noise and a person tracking one of them has to read every row.
//
// So a node is NAMED, by one small call, and the design is four properties:
//
//   - ONE CALL, ONCE, PER NODE, AND ONLY WHERE NOTHING NAMED IT. A title a model
//     WROTE as a name is left exactly as it is ([taskSpec.named]): the model that
//     groomed a proposal and called it "Fix the nil-map crash" has already done
//     this work, and the shaper's own name for a `/task` (task_shape.go) is the
//     same answer arriving on a call somebody was already paying for. A second
//     call to rename either of those would be the harness disagreeing with
//     itself and billing for it. A title that is already short and has no path
//     in it is left alone too ([taskNameNeeded]), which is what stops a door
//     that names its work well from paying for a call that changes nothing.
//
//   - THE CHEAP MODEL. It resolves through internal/roles as RoleTaskName, on
//     the low tier, beside the session's own namer: naming in a few words is the
//     archetypal cheap call, and it is one of the calls that must NOT think —
//     the resolved level is deliberately not put on the request. THE FLOOR IS
//     NEVER THE AUDITOR TIER: a session whose model is the high-tier judge
//     used to fall through onto that judge and bill a naming call as if it
//     were a verdict (F38).
//
//   - IT NEVER BLOCKS THE WORK. The node is admitted, checkpointed and on the
//     frontier before this call is made; it runs on a goroutine of its own with
//     its own deadline, and the surfaces draw the fallback they draw today until
//     the answer lands. A name that never arrives costs a good name and nothing
//     else — there is no state for "a small thing did not work" and inventing
//     one would report a fault about work nobody asked for.
//
//   - THE NAME IS THE TITLE, NOT A SECOND FIELD BESIDE IT. It is written into
//     the node's spec, which means the checkpoint keeps it (task_store.go), a
//     resume reads it back, the project index rows are cut from it, presence
//     publishes it, and every surface that already draws a title draws the name
//     with no change of its own. One update is published so a row that is
//     already on screen learns it (internal/tui3's taskRenames handles exactly
//     this: a row may be published before its name is known and again after).
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT NAMED. A sub-harness design node (TaskKindHarness)
// keeps the title harness_task.go gives it, because its row is read as a design
// and not as a task.
//
// AN ADAPTIVE RUN'S INNER NODES ARE NAMED HERE TOO, at the foot of this file,
// and they are the reason this file is not only about [TaskGraph.admit]. They
// are not graph nodes — orchestrate.go publishes those rows itself — so the
// first property above is where they start: the planner is asked for each
// node's name on the call it adds the node (internal/orchestrate's
// [orchestrate.Node] Title), which is a name arriving on a call somebody was
// already paying for. But a planner is a model, and a model asked for a title
// answers `{"id": "r1", "goal": …}` often enough that a person watched a live
// run draw `r1` through `r7` down the rail with `synth` at the foot of them.
// So the same four properties close over that case as well: a node whose title
// is missing or is nothing but its own id goes through THE SAME CALL, on the
// same cheap model, on a goroutine, and its row renames when the answer lands
// ([orchestrateFamily.nameWorker], and internal/orchestrate's NodeNeedsName for
// the one generic question that decides it).
