// ── one account for the process: another conversation's work is not this one's ──
//
// Two conversations share one process — tabs share the binary — and /proc
// cannot say which of them started which compiler: a reading that carries a
// build carries it for the whole tree. Both tests below state one machine and
// two graphs over it and ask the oldest question in accounting: whose work is
// this? A second conversation's build must not become this one's per-node
// weight, and its visible memory must not stand in for this one's reservation
// (#907).

// ANOTHER CONVERSATION'S BUILD IS NOT THIS ONE'S PER-NODE WEIGHT. This
// conversation has two parts running and neither is holding anything yet; a
// second conversation in the same process starts one node whose build shows
// six core-shares in the tree every reading reads. Three lanes are out in the
// process and twelve gibibytes are visible above rest, so what a lane has been
// seen to weigh is four — and that is what this conversation's next fan is
// judged at. Divided over this conversation's own two lanes alone, the same
// reading says six core-shares a lane, and the measured footprint only rises,
// so that one reading would have narrowed every later fan here for the rest of
// the session.
