package session

// The chat log is the LOSSLESS FLOOR under compaction.
//
// Until this file existed, a compaction was lossy at the journal level: the
// marker's meaning is "discard everything above me", so a resume came back
// holding a summary and nothing else, and the transcript those words were
// written from could never be read again by anybody. That was tolerable only
// while the summary was the record. It is not the record any more — the new pass
// stubs and folds instead of summarizing (loop.go) — so the full text has to
// live somewhere a person and a later session can still reach.
//
// It lives in the store. Every user message, every assistant reply and every
// tool result is posted to the store's thread as it lands, under the SESSION'S
// OWN ID, which is the id the transcript header already carries and every resume
// already keeps. So the thread is minted once, by the journal, and reused
// forever after; there is no second identity to keep in step with the first.
//
// ── WHAT A POST ACTUALLY CARRIES ──
//
// A message that fits ([store.MaxMessageBytes], 16KiB) is posted whole. Anything
// larger is spilled to a file of this session's own — the same content-addressed
// droppings a stub writes into (stub.go) — and the posted body names it. The
// store's own content-addressed blobs would be the better home, and the reason
// they are not used is that [store.Store] exposes no writer for them; the spill
// is the honest fallback rather than a bad copy of one.
//
// ── AND IT IS BEST-EFFORT, ALWAYS ──
//
// No store is memory off, which is most builds, and it posts nothing at all. A
// post that fails is dropped in silence. NEVER FAIL A TURN OVER IT: the session
// file is still the record it always was, and the announce line after a
// compaction says which of the two floors this session actually has.
//
// ── WHY A GOROUTINE AND NOT A CALL ──
//
// A post is a SQLite transaction against a database the resident may also be
// writing, and one that loses the race for the write lock waits seconds for it.
// The record seams ([Agent.recordLocked], [Agent.recordUserLocked]) run under
// a.mu, which is the lock Interrupt has to be able to take, so a write there
// could park a person's stop for as long as the lock is held. Instead the seam
// appends to an unbounded queue — one append, no blocking, no dropping — and one
// writer goroutine drains it in order.
//
// ── AND WHY THE DRAIN AT CLOSE HAS A DEADLINE ──
//
// [chatJournal.close] is on the quit path, and until it had a clock it was the
// place a quit could hang: it waited for the queue with no bound at all, behind
// a store write that itself waited ten uncancellable seconds for a lock another
// process was holding. Quitting is not negotiable — a person who has pressed
// ctrl+c twice is owed their terminal back — so the drain gets [closeSettle],
// and what has not landed by then is said out loud in the log rather than
// waited for or pretended about. The session file still holds every word.

// closeSettle is how long a quit waits for the store's copy of the conversation
