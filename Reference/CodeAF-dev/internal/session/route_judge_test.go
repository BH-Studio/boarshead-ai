// EFFECTS: what the judge DOES is start work, and work must not appear over the
// top of a turn the other reader is about to re-open or hand over — the person
// would be shown a task about an answer that is being withdrawn, and the
// re-opened pass would judge the same request all over again.
//
// So the reading answers a [judgeRuling] and the TURN spends it. Read from the
// mechanism's own law: TAKE is where an answer can still be SPENT, and an answer
// that has already spent itself is not one (sidecar.go). This is the test of
