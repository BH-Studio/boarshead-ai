// PROPORTION, AS TESTS: the three places this build teaches that checking is
// paid for, so its depth follows what the answer changes.
//
// The finding behind them is a measured one. Handed work whose answer turned out
// to be "this already holds", the model spent two minutes and forty-eight
// seconds and twenty-two tool calls re-deriving every requirement of something
// that was already true, and then said so — the right conclusion, reached
// through a ceremony nobody could have billed for. The teaching is not a rule
// with a number in it: nothing here counts calls, weighs a diff or thresholds
// anything, because a threshold is a rule the model games rather than a
// principle it reasons from.
//
// These are WORDING pins, in the shape task_divide_test.go pins the road's own
// sentences: the three prompts are the whole of the mechanism, so a sentence
// deleted from one of them is the mechanism deleted, and nothing else in the
// suite would notice.
