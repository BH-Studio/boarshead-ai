// THE SECOND LOOK: a steer that arrived while the command was still young.
//
// [steerBashAge] is a bargain about the COMMAND — a two-second `git status` may
// finish its batch, because waiting two seconds is cheaper than throwing the
// call's own answer away. It was being read as a bargain about the PERSON. A
// correction typed half a second into a build was measured once, found to be
// young, and never looked at again: the steer then waited for the command to
// END, or for the session's background-after clock to end it for them — thirty
// seconds in a live chat (config's DefaultBashBackgroundAfter). A question
// somebody typed at half a second answered at thirty is the wait this file
// exists to bound.
//
// SO THE MEASUREMENT IS TAKEN AGAIN, ONCE, WHEN IT CAN CHANGE ITS ANSWER. One
// timer is armed for the moment the youngest running call crosses
// [steerBashAge], and when it fires it walks the SAME adoption path the steer
// itself walked ([Agent.steerRunningBashLocked]) with the same lock held. There
// is no second rule about which commands may be adopted, no second sentence for
// the tool result, and no second kind of job — the only new thing is WHEN the
// one question is asked. What that bounds is THE HANDOFF: the command is let go
// of within [steerBashAge] of the correction's arrival plus whatever the
// scheduler adds, whatever the command turns out to be. It is not a promise
// about the model's answer — the batch may hold other tools, and the request
// itself takes as long as a request takes — and a command that finishes on its
// own inside that window is still never touched.
//
// ── WHAT MAKES A TIMER SAFE TO FIRE LATE ──
//
// A timer is a promise about the future made with facts from the past, and
// every one of those facts can be stale by the time it fires. So the watch
// carries the identities it was armed for and re-checks all of them under a.mu
// before it touches anything:
//
//	THE TURN. [Agent.turnSeq] is taken at arming and compared at firing, so a
//	timer left over from a turn that has ended cannot adopt the commands of the
//	turn that replaced it — the case where the old promise is not merely useless
//	but wrong.
//	THE COMMANDS. The exact [bare.BashCall] pointers are captured, and only a
//	call still in flight AND in that set may be adopted. A command that finished
//	naturally inside the grace leaves the timer with nothing to do, which is the
//	whole of how a short command stays untouched.
//	THE WORDS. The queue is re-read at firing rather than captured, because a
//	person who typed twice has said the second thing more recently. A steer that
//	has already landed is not steered again, and a queue with nothing left on it
//	makes the firing inert.
//
// AND A STOP NEVER WAITS FOR THIS FILE AT ALL. An unmistakable stop phrase
// ([steerStopsBash]) acts on the commands in flight the instant it is typed,
// whatever their age, and cancels any watch already armed ([Agent.Steer]): the
// grace is a bargain about letting a SHORT COMMAND FINISH, and a person who
// said `stop` is not asking for it to finish. So the delayed look never has a
// stop to carry out, and never has to decide how long an old one stays true.
//
// ── ONE TIMER, AND THE LOCK IT DOES NOT TAKE THE LONG WAY ROUND ──
//
// There is at most one watch on the agent at a time: arming replaces whatever
// was there and stops it, so two steers into one batch cannot leave two timers
// racing to adopt the same call (the claim inside [bare.BashCall.Adopt] would
// make the loser a no-op, but a duplicate timer is a duplicate promise and this
// file would rather not own one). It is stopped by the turn's own cleanup and
// by Close, so nothing outlives the session that armed it.
//
// The firing goroutine takes a.mu directly and calls into the job registry with
// it held, exactly as [Agent.Steer] does. It is NOT reached through a registry
// callback: a lane that got here from inside the registry's own lock would be
// taking the two locks in the opposite order from every other road, which is a
// deadlock and was one.
