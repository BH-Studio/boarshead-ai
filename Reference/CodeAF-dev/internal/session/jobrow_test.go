// Every case here reads the LANE a surface draws from — [Agent.WatchTaskUpdates],

//
// WHAT THEY WAIT FOR IS AN [EventJobUpdate] AND NOT A TASK ROW. A job used to be
// announced as a [TaskNotice] of a `job` kind, and these cases waited on that;
// the row is still what the CHECKPOINT keeps, because a file already written is
// read by the codeaf that opens it next, but nothing is drawn from it any more.
// A job that arrived on the roster's lane would be one piece of work counted
// twice — once in the jobs section and once among the task families.
