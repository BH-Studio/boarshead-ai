// tools_sense.go — a file is a file, so `read` reads it.
//
// Decision 20 settled the shape once, for PDFs: a person drops a file in and
// says "what does it say", and every belt that answers by GROWING A SECOND HAND
// has made the model choose between two verbs for one intention. Models choose
// wrong, reliably. This file is that decision generalized to the other three
// kinds of file whose meaning lives one decode deeper than their bytes.
//
// A screenshot, a voice memo, a song, a screen recording. The model's instinct
// on each of them is the same instinct it has for a source file — "I need to
// look at this / listen to this → read it" — and that instinct must simply
// work. What it must NOT have to do is pick an endpoint. There is no
// `transcribe` verb and no `look_at` verb on the belt for this, because the
// model does not know, before it has heard the file, whether the answer is a
// transcript or "acoustic guitar, slow, melancholy": THE LADDER PICKS THE
// SENSE, in exactly the way read_document's rungs pick the parser.
//
// ONE WRAPPER, ONE SNIFF, ONE ROUTE. The obvious alternative — chain a wrapper
// per kind, as tools_pdf.go's did alone — was rejected: four wrappers each
// parse the same arguments and resolve the same path, so a file two of them
// could claim is decided by the ORDER THEY HAPPEN TO BE APPLIED IN, which is a
// line in another file. Here the kinds are a table, the collisions are visible,
// and the cost of the whole thing on an ordinary source file is one stat and a
// map lookup.
//
// THE SENSES ARE UNCONDITIONAL, which is tools_doc.go's inversion of the
// absence law and lands here for the same reason. `read` is already on the
// belt, always; a sense that is sometimes there would make `read` a tool whose
// meaning depends on settings the model cannot see. So a missing resolver is
// answered with A SENTENCE NAMING WHAT IS MISSING — never a silent fall-through
// to bare, which would hand a model 4MB of base64-looking garbage and let it
// conclude the file was corrupt.
//
// AND read's SENSE AND read_document's LADDER ARE TWO DOORS, deliberately, by
// Decision 20's own precedent. A .png reaches both: bare `read` answers with
// the UNDIRECTED extraction below — transcribe everything, describe everything,
// one fixed prompt — while `read_document` keeps its own rungs and its own
// `question`, and `view_image` (the sight lane) keeps the question-directed
// look. Same file, three intentions, and the one the model reached for is the
// one it gets.
