// THE HOLD A PROGRAM'S RUN HAS ON ITS FOLDER, and everything that asks it.
//
// A program works in a plain folder itself (programfolder.go), so while it runs
// that folder is its. In a repository it works in a copy of its own
// (programcopy.go) and holds only the copy, which is why runs on one
// repository never wait for each other or refuse the person's tools. The hold is how every other road in codeaf knows:
// a flock on a file under the state root named for the folder, which dies with
// the last process holding it however that process dies — codeaf, and the
// program's own process it hands the hold to ([ProgramFolder.Hold]) — and which holds between
// two windows, two conversations in one engine and a shell alike, because a
// flock is per open file.
//
// A FOLDER IS BUSY WHEN A HELD FOLDER IS IT, HOLDS IT, OR IS INSIDE IT. A run
// on a plain folder of projects checkpoints everything under it and, once it
// has submitted, puts back whatever changed there and removes whatever was
// added; a second run in one of those projects had its edits reverted and its
// new files deleted under it, while both held their own exact path and each
// was sure it was alone. So the question is asked of the tree: the folders
// above a path by name, and every held folder below it by reading what each
// hold says it holds.

// IN A PLAIN FOLDER A PROGRAM WORKS IN THE PERSON'S LIVE FOLDER — there is no
// history to cut a copy from — and what anything else writes there meanwhile
// becomes the program's to act on. Once
// senior-dev has submitted it checks its frozen tree, and a tree that moved is
// put back — `checkout --force`, `reset`, `clean -fd` — which reverts a file
// the chat edited and deletes one it wrote, with no copy kept; an ordinary
// task merged into it mid-run is undone the same way while its row says it
// landed; and whatever survives is swept into the run's finishing commit as
// the program's work. So while a program holds a folder, from any conversation,
// window or shell:
//
//   - the chat's own file tools refuse a path inside it ([programHoldGuard]),
//     and reading stays open;
//   - an ordinary task — a proposal's card, a typed `/task`, a quick task, a
//     node starting on the session's own graph or on the run road — whose
//     folder is inside it, or holds it, is refused before it starts
//     ([programHoldRefusal]);
//   - a task that was already running lands beside it rather than into it: its
//     branch kept, its copy not laid, a `/land` refused.
//
// `bash` IS NOT FENCED, and neither is the person's own editor: a command's
// effects are whatever it did, and a guard that pattern-matched commands would
// promise what it cannot keep ([treeClaimGuard] says the same). The manual says
// so plainly (senior-dev.md), and that edits made there join the run's work.
