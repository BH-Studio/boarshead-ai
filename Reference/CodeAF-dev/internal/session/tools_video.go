// generate_video: a verb that ANSWERS BEFORE IT IS FINISHED — the belt's first;
// generate_music (tools_music.go) now keeps the same law.
//
// /videos is submit-then-poll on the wire, and a render is minutes rather than
// seconds — ten of them, at the provider's own ceiling. Every other tool on this
// belt returns what it did; this one cannot, because a turn that waited would be
// a conversation the person cannot use until a file they cannot see yet exists.
// So THE ASYNC LAW (docs/MULTIMODAL.md, Decision 7): the tool submits and comes
// back in seconds with a job id, the poll runs where jobs run, and the finished
// video reaches the model the way every other job's ending does — a note on the
// steering lane, drained into the transcript at the next step boundary.
//
// It is `bash background:true` with a provider on the other end instead of a
// process (tools_jobs.go, jobs.go), and deliberately the same in every visible
// way: the same id space, the same log file, the same row in `jobs list`, the
// same `jobs kill`, and the same death at Close. A model that has learned what a
// background job is has learned what this is.
//
// The landing happens INSIDE the job, not in the tool call: the bytes arrive
// minutes after the call returned, so the destination, the artifact row and the
// auxiliary spend are all the goroutine's work, and the note names the path.

This tool RETURNS IMMEDIATELY with a background job id, because a render takes minutes: the work keeps going while you and the user carry on talking, and when it lands you are told in a note naming the file — you do not wait for it, poll it, or call it twice. Give frame_paths to pin the motion (the first image is the opening frame, a second is the closing one) and reference_paths for pictures that set the style. EVERY CALL IS AN INDEPENDENT RENDER: the video model sees only this prompt and these images — no earlier clip, none of this conversation — so anything that must hold across clips (a face, a costume, a setting) must be described or passed as a picture on every call, and one clip continues from another only when the earlier clip's final frame is handed in as the next call's opening frame, which makes connected clips a sequence rather than a parallel batch. The landing note reports the clip's measured length and whether it carries sound, whenever the file can be measured. Watch it with the jobs tool and stop it with jobs kill; a stopped render saves nothing."

The whole prompt reaches the video model, so detail is worth writing — every dimension the prompt leaves open, the model fills with its statistical average, and that average is what generic AI footage looks like. Decide the medium, the light, the lens and the mood yourself and write them down; specificity is the difference between the shot you meant and a generic one. A prompt assembled from the genre's usual clichés lands on that same average by choice — escape a genre by naming a real filmmaking tradition (a film stock, a documentary setup, an animation technique), not by recoloring it.
