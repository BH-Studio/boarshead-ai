// SAME-OWNER COMPLETION, AT THE REAL DOOR (calibration-02, cell
// 018-revision-midwork-codeaf).
//
// The live trace these cases are written from is that cell's own
// `transcript.jsonl`, lines 4-37: a person asked for a one-minute command AND a
// report; the model started the command in the background (job 1), wrote the
// report, took the person's revision, wrote `report.csv` and removed
// `report.md` — every artifact they asked for — and the write seam fired on the
// second file. The mark's reader drew `(waiting)` (line 23), which is not a done
// shape, so the two-minds decline could not apply, and task 2 was admitted
// (line 37, `seam:write decision:moved`) carrying a brief whose whole content
// was "wait for ./slow-build.sh … verify the deliverables". The conversation
// answered correctly 42 seconds later when the job's own note woke it (line 40);
// the task went on to spawn repair and audit children and the cell hit its 180s
// cap.
//
// THE CELL WAS A PERSON'S CONVERSATION, so every case here sets
// [Config.Interactive] and none of them uses a steward: what decides these
// endings is two runtime facts and one typed answer, and a principal that a
// person's session never has cannot be the mechanism (handoff_remainder.go).
