// THE WRITE SEAM, PROVED (issue #272, part 2, on the owner's ruling).
//
// The measured run is one sentence: a chat turn made forty-eight tool calls and
// edited a person's live checkout with `sed -i` for seven minutes and forty-six
// seconds before anything noticed. Reads are free here, exactly as the ruling
// says; a turn that has written past the small allowance is moved to a task
// through the road the ceiling already takes.
