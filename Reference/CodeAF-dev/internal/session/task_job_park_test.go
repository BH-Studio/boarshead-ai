// THE WORKER THAT WAS ASKED WHAT TO DO NEXT WHILE ITS COMMAND WAS STILL RUNNING.
//
// Every test here is written from ONE REAL RUN. A task child ran its suite as an
// ordinary foreground `bash` call. The call outlived the session's
// background-after clock, so the promotion road adopted the process and the tool
// answered `still running as job 1; log at …` (promote.go) — which is the right
// answer to the question "is the work lost", and no answer at all to the
// question the turn loop asked one instant later, which was "what next". The
// worker had a running suite, no result from it, and a model waiting for a move.
// So it manufactured one: `sleep 28; tail <log>`, again, and again. The loop
// detector read that for what it looked like — the same call producing nothing —
// and the node was stopped for going in circles while the suite it was waiting
// for was healthy and eight seconds from green.
//
// So the law these pin is one sentence, and it is task_park_test.go's own law
// pointed at the other thing a worker can be waiting for: WAITING IS NOT WORKING,
// AND IT IS NOT SPINNING EITHER. A foreground call taken over by the promotion
// road is still THE CALL THE WORKER MADE — it is owed its ending — so the worker
// is parked on it, not asked, not counted, not clocked, and THE FIRST TURN AFTER
// THE PROMOTION IS THE TURN THAT READS THE ENDING.
//
// AND ONLY THAT ONE. A call that asked for `background: true` was never a call
// anybody was waiting for: it went to [jobRegistry.start] and was a job from its
// first instant (promote.go states the branch), and a worker held open by one of
// those would be a worker that can never hand its work back.
//
// ── WHAT THESE MEASURE, AND WHAT THEY DELIBERATELY DO NOT ──
//
// THE LOAD-BEARING CLAIM IS AN ORDER AND NEVER A CLOCK. "The worker was asked
// again before its command ended" reads as a duration, and a duration is what a
// first draft of this file asserted — against a watcher that recorded the ending
// when it NOTICED the state change. Once the wait existed the true gap fell to
// under a millisecond, which is the scale at which a poller is reporting its own
// scheduling and nothing else. The order does not have that problem: the request
// after the promotion either carries the command's ending or it does not, and on
// a tree without the wait it carries nothing at all. The exact instant is still
// read where a duration is worth printing, and it is read from [job.settle]'s own
// stamp ([waitSettled]) rather than from anybody watching.
//
// AND THE ORDER IS NOT LEFT TO A CLOCK EITHER — that is what [heldCommand] is
// for, and its comment is the second law of this file: A TEST MUST NOT RACE A
// CLOCK IT CAN OWN.
//
// AND THE LOOP DETECTOR IS LEFT ALONE. A worker that polls a log after its
// ending has arrived is repeating itself, and being stopped for it is the reader
// working correctly — #568 says so in as many words. So the nudge is asserted
// about only over the stretch the worker was PARKED, and everything the model
// chooses afterwards is its own.

// it. HOW LONG THE COMMAND THEN RUNS IS NOT THIS NUMBER'S BUSINESS: it is the
// test's, and [heldCommand] is how the test holds it.
//
// The namer is answered off the queue because a promoted command becomes a job,

// of the wait — and the command is left RUNNING, because the bound ends the WAIT
// and never the WORK.
//
// The command here is held open by the test and never released on its own, so the
// only ending it can have is the one the test gives it at the very end. The bound
// is the park's own share of the allowance, and the clock is the run's own seam:
// advancing it is what trips the bound, so nothing below races a clock it can own

// on the counter that eventually killed it.

// whether or not it has been given the ending. A worker that is parked cannot
// reach the polls until its command has ended, so over the stretch it was
// waiting it spends NO step and earns NO nudge — and everything it chooses to do
// after the ending is its own, including being stopped for repeating itself,
// which is the reader working correctly and is deliberately not asserted about.
