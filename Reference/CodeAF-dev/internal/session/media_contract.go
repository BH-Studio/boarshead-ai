// media_contract.go is the belt's slice of the provider media client — the
// interface [Config.Media] carries (docs/MULTIMODAL.md, the v3 revision).
//
// It is an interface for tools_image.go's reason: tests substitute a scripted
// generator, and the session package must not depend on which struct
// internal/provider hands over. provider.MediaClient satisfies it as it
// stands, so the wiring is one assignment with no adapter.

// references for image-to-image), speech, the async video job — and, since the
// senses landed, transcription. A nil MediaGenerator keeps every generation
// tool off the belt.
//
// THE NAME SAYS "GENERATOR" AND THE FOURTH METHOD PERCEIVES, which is worth one
// sentence. This is one client and not four, because it is one account, one key
// and one base URL, and the belt would learn nothing from a second interface
// that resolved to the same struct. The alternative — a MediaPerceiver beside
// it — buys a truer noun and costs every caller a second nil check for a client
// that is present or absent as a unit.

	// asking for an audio modality back (internal/provider/music.go). A caller
