// RESOLVING A NODE NOBODY COULD JUDGE — the three answers, and what they must
// not do to each other.
//
// Every test here is about a node that has ALREADY LANDED in TaskUnverified.
// The work is over, the branch is where it was kept, and the only thing that
// moves it is somebody deciding: an accept, a refute, or a fresh auditor whose
// verdict arrives minutes later ([Agent.ResolveUnverified]). Three doors onto
// one landing is exactly the shape that goes wrong two ways — two answers at
// once, and an answer that overwrites the account of the work it is answering —
// and those two are what is asserted below.

// unverifiedNode lands one node in TaskUnverified with the report a real one
// carries: the audit's non-answer, and the work's own claim under it
// (task_run.go's workTaskNode). It runs in the person's own tree, so nothing
// here needs a repository — the branch is what a merge would move, and an
// in-place node has none.
