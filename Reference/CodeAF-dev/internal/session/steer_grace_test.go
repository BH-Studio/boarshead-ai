// THE GRACE: a steer that arrived one second too early must not wait a minute.
//
// [steerBashAge] is a bargain about the COMMAND — a short one may finish its
// batch — and it was being read as a bargain about the PERSON: a correction
// typed half a second into a sixty-second build was skipped once and never
// looked at again, so it waited for the command to end or for the session's
// background clock (thirty seconds in a live chat) to end it. These tests are
// about the second look.
