// ── ONE CALL NOBODY TYPED ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// An auxiliary call is an errand: the name a session gives itself, the two words
// a task is called, the judge that reads one turn and answers one question. They
// are all the same shape — resolve a role to a model, ask once, bill the person
// for it — and until this file each of them spelled that shape itself, which is
// how three of them ended up with three different answers to the two questions
// below.
//
// HOW LONG IT MAY TAKE. The adapter bounds a completion between five and fifteen
// minutes, scaled off the output cap (internal/provider's
// adaptiveCompletionTimeout). That is the right bound for a person's turn and a
// ridiculous one for eight words of title: a session with a wedged errand held a
// provider slot and a goroutine for a quarter of an hour, and the person waiting
// for their own turn behind it was told nothing. So every errand carries the
// bound of its role's TIER ([roles.PatienceFor]) — derived, never a table of
// per-role seconds — and a caller that knows its own call is tighter still says
// so and wins, because the nearer of two deadlines on one context is the one in
// force.
//
// THAT BOUND IS THE ERRAND'S AND NOT EACH RUNG'S. See [Agent.callRoleChecked]
// for the whole of why, and for what does bound one rung: the same stream guard
// the turn runs under, which cuts silence and leaves an answer that is being
// written alone.
//
// AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE MODEL CANNOT ANSWER AT ALL. The errand used to be
// abandoned: a role pinned to a small model that is down, or a tier naming a
// slug an account has lost access to, and the session simply had no title, no
// task name, no judgement — quietly, with the model the person is talking to
// sitting there able to do the work.
//
// So it FALLS THROUGH ONE RUNG. The rung is the roles ladder's own next entry —
// pin, then tier, then the model the conversation is on — and that is the whole
// reason it is the ladder and not the adapter's fallback chain. The ladder is
// ALREADY the one answer to "which model answers this call"; its floor is the
// session model, which is by construction a model that works, because it is the
// one answering the person's own turns. The adapter's chain answers a different
// question — "where does this CONVERSATION go" — and it already applies to these
// calls underneath, on a refusal and on pacing that will not clear
// (internal/provider's endpoints.go). Spelling "the next model" twice over one
// request is how two answers drift.
//
// ONE rung, and then the failure is real. A ladder walked to the bottom on every
// errand would turn one bad minute at a provider into three charges and three
// waits for an answer nobody asked for.

// roleFallThroughs is how many rungs BELOW the resolved one an errand may try.
// One: see above.
const roleFallThroughs = 1

// callRole makes one auxiliary call and reports which model actually answered.
//
// The returned model is not decoration and callers must bill THAT one: an
// errand that fell through and was billed against the model that refused it
// would put a charge on a row nobody's request ever reached.
//
// `sessionDefault` is the ladder's floor, exactly as [roles.ResolveCall] takes
// it — except under [Config.OneModel], where the floor is the conversation's own
// model whatever the caller passed, for the reason spelled at that seam below.
// Options are the caller's own — temperature, output cap, a response format
// — and the model is added here so no caller can name one that disagrees with
// the rung it is on.
func (a *Agent) callRole(
	ctx context.Context,
	role roles.Role,
	sessionDefault string,
	messages []ai.Message,

// is abandoned. The check accounts for rejected replies, because those still cost.

	// ONE MODEL MEANS ONE MODEL AT EVERY RUNG. A crew-only caller passes an empty
	// floor deliberately — it is a quality judgement about a profile that HAS a
	// crew, and it refuses to let the running model mark its own work — but the
	// person who passed `--one-model` has already said the conversation's model
	// is the crew. Left alone, those callers had no pin, no tier and no floor
	// under the flag, so [roles.Ladder] answered ErrNoModel and a measured run
	// had no mark reader and no brief writer at all (#443). It is decided HERE,
	// at the one seam every errand passes through, so the next crew-only caller
	// is correct without knowing the flag exists.
	//
	// THE FLOOR IS a.model AND NOT THE TURN'S LATCHED MODEL, because it is the
	// same live conversation model every other errand already passes as its own
	// floor (title.go, taskname.go, route_judge.go all read it live). A /model
	// typed mid-turn reaches the turn's own next request now ([Agent.SetModel]),
	// so reading it live here moves the crew-only rungs WITH the work rather than
	// leaving the errands beside a turn talking to a model they do not know about.

		sessionDefault = a.model

	// ERRAND passes through, including errands whose own deadline is not derived
	// from a turn; arming them separately would leave the next one able to lose
	// the receipt this shared seam exists to keep.
	//
	// AND "ERRAND" IS NARROWER THAN "MODEL CALL", WHICH IS WHAT THIS SENTENCE USED
	// TO CLAIM. It said this was the door all auxiliary provider calls pass
	// through, and ten did not: the guardian, vision, the shaper, the spell-out,
	// the intake, the planner, the designer, the ceiling's handoff draft, a saved
	// program's own step and the standing sentinel each reached the wire by
	// another road. Some of them still do, legitimately — vision STREAMS into the
	// room in the person's own turn, the handoff draft is billed to the turn on
	// the turn's own model, a program's step runs on the program's model and no
	// role's — and an errand ladder wrapped round any of those would be the wrong
	// shape twice over. What every one of them owes is the TAG, and that is the
	// claim that is now true and enforced: clientdoor.go's [callPurpose] is the
	// one door every REQUEST passes through, this one is the one door every
	// ERRAND passes through, and neither pretends to be the other.
	ctx = provider.WithReconcile(ctx, a.reconciled)
	if len(rungs) > roleFallThroughs+1 {
		rungs = rungs[:roleFallThroughs+1]
	}
	patience := roles.PatienceFor(role)
	// THE PATIENCE IS THE ERRAND'S AND NOT EACH RUNG'S, and that is the whole of
	// what changed here on 2026-09-10.
	//
	// It used to be divided evenly — `what is left / rungs still to come`, armed
	// as a hard [context.WithTimeout] on the call. A WALL CLOCK CANNOT TELL A
	// RUNG THAT IS SILENT FROM A RUNG THAT IS ANSWERING, so it killed both.
	// Measured on task 1 of conversation 57d51779f63ac603: the division review's
	// three minutes became ninety seconds a rung, the first rung wrote its first
	// token in one second and was still writing at ninety when it was cut, the
	// second did the same, and the parts were admitted with nobody having read
	// them — after three minutes and twenty seconds in which the person watching
	// saw one word.
	//
	// WHAT BOUNDS ONE RUNG NOW IS THE GUARD THE TURN ALREADY RUNS UNDER. Every
	// completion this process makes is served over the event stream whether or
	// not anybody is reading it (internal/provider's [Client.CompleteWithMessages]
	// — the fail-safe that armed only when a person was looking was decoration,
	// and stopped being one). So a rung that goes quiet is cut by streamguard.go's
	// first-delta and mid-stream bounds in tens of seconds, and a rung that is
	// writing is bounded by the wall its lane's own measured history earns it,
	// which re-arms for as long as the stream keeps pace (#786). An errand
	// inherits both for nothing.
	//
	// AND THAT IS ALSO WHY THE SPLIT IS NO LONGER NEEDED. It was written for
	// 2026-08-28, where a mastermind endpoint sat silent for a review's entire
	// three minutes and the fall-through rung — whose floor is the model
	// answering the person's own turns, alive by construction — was never asked.
	// The guard ends that rung in tens of seconds now, so the rung below is
	// reached with nearly the whole budget still on the clock, which is more time
	// than an even share ever gave it.
	//
	// So the tier's patience bounds the ERRAND, once. Every rung runs on whatever
	// is left of it, and a caller with a nearer deadline of its own still wins,
	// because [context.WithTimeout] keeps the nearer of the two.
	//
	// EXCEPT FOR WHAT THE RUNGS BELOW ARE OWED, which is [errandReserve] and is
	// the one piece of the old arithmetic worth keeping. The guard cuts a rung
	// that is not working — but there is one shape it cannot see, a gateway that
	// takes `stream: true` and answers a whole completion in one piece
	// (internal/provider's [Client.completionInOnePiece] arms no stall watch), and
	// a wedged endpoint behind one of those would eat the whole errand and leave
	// the ladder's floor unasked. A fifth held back is enough that the floor —
	// the model already answering the person's own turns — is always reachable,
	// and far enough above the guard's own wall that it never cuts a stream the
	// guard was happy with. That is the difference between a reserve and the even
	// split it replaces.
	errandCtx, endErrand := context.WithTimeout(ctx, patience)
	// AND THE ERRAND SAYS WHAT IT IS FOR, ON EVERY ROW IT WRITES.
	//
	// THE ROLE IS THE TAG, because the role is what the errand IS — naming a
	// conversation, judging a route, writing a caption — and it is the same word
	// internal/lane's roles.go and the journal's own call line already use, so
	// three records of one call agree about what to call it. It is carried to
	// the door as a [callPurpose] rather than stamped on the context here: the
	// door is what every request in this package passes over, and it is the only
	// thing that spells the tag (clientdoor.go says why that had to move).

// file has — a rung below, whose floor is the model already answering the

// `fallback`, which is what makes the hop reachable at all.
// [taxonomy.ActionGiveUp] is the same news with nowhere left, and it ends the
// errand.
//
// AND [taxonomy.ActionRetry] IS READ AGAINST THE ERRAND'S OWN PATIENCE RATHER
// THAN THE MODEL'S. It means the MODEL has not run out of anything, which is the
// right answer for a turn and the wrong one for an errand: one request is the
// whole of a rung here, so by the time a rung's failure is read this rung has
// nothing left. So a retry with a rung below is this ladder's hop, taken at once
// and without the backoff:
// asking a different model is what "ask again" means here, and it is more than
// [taxonomy.Verdict.Rotate] was asking for. With no rung below it is the end.
// (Honouring it as a SAME-RUNG retry was measured on 2026-09-10 and is not
// available until the transport budget can be the caller's: it fires on the
// first failure, and the pauses timed out the naming job and two turns a person
// waits through.)
//
// AND ONE FAILURE THE TAXONOMY CANNOT DECIDE ON ITS OWN. Everything it cannot
// place lands in [taxonomy.Work] — which is right for a 4XX THAT NAMED NOBODY,
// the router reading our own bytes and saying no, where the rung below is a
// second charge for the same refusal — and wrong for "that model is down", which
// arrives as a sentence nothing can classify and is the exact case the ladder was
// built for (taskname_test.go's fall-through). A class that catches both cannot
// be the gate, so the doomed request is recognised by the EVIDENCE, narrowly: the
// router reading our own bytes and saying no. Every other work verdict falls
// through one rung, as this file's header has always said it does.
//
// AND IT READS THE EVIDENCE RATHER THAN A STATUS (#854, the last entry on that
// change's `seamsOwed`). This spelled `Status >= 400 && Status < 500 && Upstream
// == ""` by hand, which was a FOURTH rule about what a 4xx means beside the three
// the one classifier had just folded into one — and a fourth rule is the defect
// that design closed. [taxonomy.Evidence.OurBytes] is exactly that sentence,
// decided once at the refusal door, and [taxonomy.Evidence.Overflow] is beside it
