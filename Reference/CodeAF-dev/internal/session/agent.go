		// which is [Agent.SetModel]'s hole through the other door. The scrub is
		// the same function both doors call, and it is done HERE because
		// [replaySessionFile] is a pure function of the file: which model this
		// session will ride, and whether it can see, are facts about the agent,
		// and threading a capability closure into a file parser would put the

		//
		// THIS ALSO RESTORES THE SPEND RAIL, and that is the intended change: the

		// the process was a ceiling on a window, not on a conversation.

// startLaneBeat begins this session's lane-sheet beat, or does nothing at all.
//
// The router publishes, per model, one row per machine serving it — first-token
// latency and throughput over the last half hour — and that is a free prior for
// every lane this session might be sent to, so nothing is blind on the first
// call (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, Decision 10). `internal/lane` decodes it and
// primes the belief from it, but it starts no goroutine of its own by design:
// who is fetching, and when, is a question with an answer in the session's own
// code rather than in a package nobody thought was running.
//
// TWO SESSIONS RUN NO BEAT, and each refusal is a different fact.
//
//   - ROUTING OFF is a person saying they do not want their endpoints chosen
//     for them (internal/provider's velocity.go). With the row off, every lane
//     the belief holds is inert — nothing reads it, nothing is sent from it —
//     and a background fetch would be work nobody asked for on somebody who
//     asked for the opposite.
//   - AND A SESSION WITH NO MODEL SLOT FILLED has nothing to fetch a sheet
//     about, which is the constructor's own guard reaching this far.
//
// THE BASE URL IS NOT A REFUSAL. This seam used to read the hostname and run
// no beat unless it said `openrouter.ai`, which left every session pointed at
// a proxy, a mirror or a router reached by its IP with no sheet at all (issue
// #373). Whether a base publishes an endpoints page is the base's own to say:
// the sheet asks it once, on the first refresh, and a base that says there is
// none is left alone until that answer is stale ([lanes.ErrNoSheetHere]). So
// the beat runs whenever routing is on, and on a base with no page it is one
// quiet request every five minutes rather than a feature that is absent.
//
// It is called once, from the constructor, before the agent is reachable —
// which is what lets the field it writes be read afterwards without a lock,
// exactly as [Agent.presence] is.

// sessionCompleter is the Completer every request goes through, and it does two

//
// ── THE CACHE LINEAGE, AND WHY IT DEVIATES FROM bare ──
//
// It stamps the session's prompt-cache key on every request. internal/exec/bare
// sends NO key at all, and that is right for what bare is: a leaf is one task,
// run once, whose prefix nothing will ever ask for again — a key there buys a
// replica pin and pays for a cache write nobody reads.
//
// A SESSION IS A LINEAGE, and the arithmetic inverts. Its transcript is re-sent
// whole on every step of every turn, grows all day, and is picked up again
// tomorrow by [Agent] resuming the same file. Without a key each request is free
// to land on whichever replica the router likes, so a warm prefix is a
// coincidence; with one, every step of a days-long conversation asks for the
// same instance and the growing head stays hot. The key is derived from the
// SESSION ID rather than from the model, the task, or the process, because that
// is the identity that survives a /model swap, a restart, and a resume — the
// three things that would otherwise split one conversation into three lineages.
//
// The key is set once, at construction, so nothing at request time can split it.
// An empty key is left off entirely rather than sent blank (provider.WithCacheKey
// ignores it), which keeps a session with no identity unkeyed instead of sharing
// one lineage with every other unkeyed session.
// ── AND THE PATIENCE ──
//
// It marks a TASK CHILD'S calls as ones that wait a provider's pacing out
// instead of giving up on it (internal/provider's patience.go). A conversation
// keeps the bounded patience it always had, and the difference between the two
// is entirely whether anybody is watching: a person in front of a cursor is owed
// an error long before they are owed a ten-minute silence, while a node with a
// worktree and nobody watching loses an hour of real work to a 429 that was
// always going to clear. The wait is still the caller's context's to end, so an

//
// A queue alone was the whole defect. A person hands off a task, the work runs
// for eleven minutes, it lands — and the note sat here until the person happened
// to type something else, so what they got for their research was a card and
// silence. The answer they asked for is a SENTENCE from the model ("the
// comparison is at ~/oauth.md; the short version is…"), and a model that is never
// asked never writes one. So a note that lands on an idle session starts a turn.
//
// THAT IS TRUE OF A BACKGROUND JOB'S ENDING, through [Agent.enqueueJobNote].
// The model started the job and was explicitly told not to poll because the
// ending would come back, so the exit remains owed. IT IS TRUE OF A WATCH'S
// FIRING FOR THE SAME REASON: a watch that matched, went quiet or failed its way
// out has answered what it was started for and will never speak again, so that
// last note is owed and [Agent.enqueueWatchNote] queues it here. Only a watch's
// repeated DELTAS are different — telemetry with a complete log behind them —
// and that lane holds those for a turn boundary instead.
//
// It is not a turn per event. Everything below coalesces: the notes queue, the
// FIRST owed one starts a turn, and one authored batch lands at the next legal
// boundary. The rail, InTask, Close and the not-yet-open session all still
// decline ([Agent.wakeLocked]).
//
// [Agent.enqueueAmbientNote] is the same step queue with the wake removed. It
// carries guidance for the turn that is already running — recovery, loop
// control, an OAuth connection — while [Agent.enqueueWatchNote] is the separate
// turn-boundary queue for periodic telemetry. Both are real context nobody is
// standing there waiting for, but only the former is an instruction to the

	//
	// "aside" is a line the SESSION WROTE and the person did not: a task's
	// completion note, a job's exit, a resume's account of what an interrupt left
	// behind (agent.go's [Agent.enqueueNote]). It rides the user role in the

	// in, and it is separated here because a surface that drew it as a user
	// message would be putting words in somebody's mouth — words that, live, that
	// same surface deliberately never draws. It is answered from the journal's own
	// mark, so a line from a file written before the mark existed still arrives as
	// "user", which is exactly what it always was.

	//
	// IT IS DERIVED FROM AN ABSENCE, and the absence is load-bearing: the

	// session read while a call is in flight names the asking and nothing else. A
	// surface that drew every recorded call as finished would tell a person the
	// work is further along than it is.
	//
	// It is a field of its own rather than `Output != ""` because a call that
	// returned nothing and a call that has not returned are different facts and a
	// page speaks about them differently.
	Answered bool

	// Args and Output are a TOOL entry's payload, in exactly the two shapes a
	// live surface already holds them in ([Event.Args] and [Event.Output]): the
	// arguments the model sent, compacted onto one line and capped, and the text
	// of the result that answered them, capped rune-safe for display.
	//
	// They are populated for a tool entry whenever the journal carries them,
	// which is every session file this build writes — the arguments ride the
	// assistant message's tool_calls and the result is the tool message keyed by
	// the same id. Both are "" otherwise: for every entry that is not a call, for
	// a call whose result never reached the file (a session killed mid-batch), and
	// for a file written before either was journaled.
	//
	// EMPTY MEANS NO PAYLOAD, and a surface must read it that way rather than as
	// an empty result: a replayed row with nothing behind it has nothing to
	// expand, and offering an expansion that opens on a blank is the defect this
	// field exists to end.

	// THEY ARE THE REASON A REOPENED CONVERSATION READS AS ITSELF. Without them

	// writes the figure onto the row as the call finishes; a page built out of
	// the record after the batch has no stream to watch, and without this field
	// the row came back with Args and Output but no duration. Zero when the
	// journal never recorded one (every file written before the `took` line, a
