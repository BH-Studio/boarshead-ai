// A member's handle, chosen by the conversation's own title model.
//
// A handle is ONE lowercase word naming what the conversation is about:
// @security for "santosh dev2 branch code complexity & security review",
// @milestones for "CodeAF repo issue tags & milestones", @gravity for "quantum
// gravity research updates / session monitor". The word list in internal/teams
// ([teams.DeriveHandle]) guesses one at once, so a member is addressable the
// moment it has a title, and the guesses it made of those three titles were
// @review, @reviewing and @session: a list cannot tell the subject of a title
// from the kind of work being done to it. A model can, in one word.
//
// IT IS THE CONVERSATION NAMER'S ERRAND WITH A ONE-WORD QUESTION, asked where
// the name is made. It goes through the same door ([Agent.callRoleChecked]) on
// the same role ([roles.RoleTitle]), so it lands on the cheap tier and is billed
// the same way, and it asks for a handful of tokens. It runs:
//
//   - right after the conversation's title is published ([Agent.publishTitle]),
//     which is the moment the title the word is read off exists; and
//   - once per process at a step boundary, for a conversation that already had
//     its title and is in a team whose handle for it is still the word list's
//     guess. That is the ONE-TIME pass over handles made before this: each is
//     chosen again, the same way, on its conversation's next turn. A timeout or
//     a dropped connection is asked once more; a refusal is not.
//
// IT RUNS ON THE MACHINE THAT OWNS THE MODEL AND THE STORE. Over --host that is
// the engine, where this session is, and the teams file is that machine's.
//
// ONLY A GUESS IS REPLACED ([teams.Member.HandleDerived]). A handle a person or
// the manager gave is never touched, and one the model chose is not chosen
// again ([teams.File.ChooseHandle]). A clash inside a team takes the model's
// second choice, then a word of the title in front of the first; never a
// number unless nothing else fits.
//
// EVERY RENAME IS SAID IN THE TEAM'S TRAFFIC, `@review is now @security`, from
// codeaf to everyone, so the manager and the members read it at their next
// step ([teamLine]) and the person sees it on the rail. The manager's role note
// names the members by handle and is read again when the teams file moves, so
// it refreshes on its own.

// handleAsk is the instruction, last in the user message for the reason
// titleSystem's comment gives.
