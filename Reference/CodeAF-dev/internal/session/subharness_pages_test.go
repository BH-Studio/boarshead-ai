// A PROGRAM SAVED AS A PAGE IS ON THE LIST, AND IT IS ON IT THE MOMENT IT IS
// SAVED.
//
// This is the scenario that was reported: somebody asks for a program to be
// built, approves the card, the design says it saved — and `/subharness` did not
// have it, because the list read two bundle stores and the page had gone to a
// third place. These tests hold the fix at the seam the surface actually opens
// ([Agent.SubharnessList] and [Agent.SubharnessIntake]), against a real registry
// with a real store on disk behind it.
