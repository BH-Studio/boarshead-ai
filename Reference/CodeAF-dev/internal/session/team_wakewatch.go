// ── TEAM TRAFFIC WAKES THE CONVERSATION IT IS FOR ───────────────────────────
//
// v1 delivered a team's lines only when a conversation next ran, and a manager
// is idle as often as its members are: it sent a directive to three idle
// members, told the person the answers would be reported as they arrived, and
// nothing ran again until the person typed. So the lines that ask for an
// answer now start one:
//
//   - A DIRECTIVE WAKES THE MEMBER IT IS ADDRESSED TO (its handle, or
//     everyone). A note does not: it is information, and it is read at the
//     member's next turn as before. A member that is busy is not started again;
//     it reads the directive at its next step boundary, the steering road
//     ([Agent.teamBoundary]).
//   - A MEMBER'S REPLY WAKES THE MANAGER: a team_post addressed to the manager,
//     and the events a member writes on its own (finished, failed, asking,
//     teamevent.go). A finished event after a reply in the same member turn
//     starts no second wake. Other arrivals COALESCE: the first arms [teamWakeSettle], and one
//     turn carries everything that arrived by the time it runs out, because
//     three members finishing within a few seconds of each other is one thing
//     to act on, not three turns that each see a third of it.
//
// THE WOKEN TURN IS NEVER THE PERSON'S. What wakes it is the same marked note
// the step boundary hands over ("◆ directive from manager: …", "from @web: …"),
// queued as the session's line with the wake bit ([Agent.wakeLocked]), so it
// is drawn in the harness's lane and every gate a wake passes (the spend rail,
// the wall, a closed or stopped session) still decides whether it may run.
//
// THE WATCH LIVES WITH THE CONVERSATION, ON THE ENGINE. Every conversation is
// an [Agent] in the process that holds its journal (the workspace's session
// host, locally and over --host alike), and the Traffic log is the one channel
// between conversations (team.go), so each conversation watches the log for
// itself. It costs, per tick of [teamWatchEvery]:
//
//   - while a turn runs, one stat of each managed member team's log, and a
//     read only when it moves, so a manager's stop can reach a headless member;
//     nothing once the session is closed;
//   - one stat of the teams file SHARED BY EVERY CONVERSATION IN THE PROCESS
//     ([sharedTeamsStamp]) while it is idle, which is how a conversation made a
//     member while it sat idle is noticed;
//   - one stat of each team's log only while it is idle AND in a managed team
//     with wake on, and a page read only when that stat moved.
//
// A CONVERSATION NOBODY HAS OPEN IS OPENED. A directive to a member no window
// and no host holds, and a reply to a manager in the same state, would wake
// nobody, so the side that wrote the line asks the engine to open that
// conversation headless ([SetTeamResume]); it attaches no surface, and a window
// that opens it later joins the running one. Where there is no such road, the
// Traffic says so (`could not wake @x: …`) rather than the writer pretending.
//
// AND IT IS BOUNDED TWICE. A conversation is woken at most [teamWakesPerHour]
// times in an hour, and a manager woken [teamLoopRounds] times by its team with
// no word from the person stops being woken and asks the person instead: a
// manager and its members answering each other forever is spend nobody asked
// for. Both are said in the Traffic, and each wake is too (`◆ woke @web`,
// `@web woke ◆`), so the rail shows why a conversation is running.

// teamWatchEvery is how often an idle conversation looks at its team's
// Traffic. A var so a test can ask in milliseconds what the product decides in
// seconds; nothing in the product writes it.
var teamWatchEvery = time.Second

// teamWakeSettle is how long a manager's wake waits after the first reply
// that asks for it, gathering whatever else arrives. Five seconds: long enough
// that members finishing on one burst of work (a fan-out's replies land within
// a second or two of each other) are one turn, short enough that a person
// watching the manager does not read the pause as the promise being broken. It
// is measured from the FIRST reply and never extended, so a steady trickle
// cannot hold the manager asleep. A var for the reason [teamWatchEvery] is.
var teamWakeSettle = 5 * time.Second

// teamWakesPerHour is the most times team traffic starts one conversation's
// turn in an hour. Twenty is a directive every three minutes for an hour,
// which is a busy team and not yet a runaway one; past it the lines still
// arrive, at the conversation's next turn.
const teamWakesPerHour = 20

// teamLoopRounds is how many times a manager is woken by its team with no word
// from the person before it stops being woken and asks the person. Ten rounds
// of hand out, hear back, hand out again is a real piece of delegated work; a
// manager and members still answering each other after that are more likely
// talking in a circle than finishing, and the person is the one who can tell.
