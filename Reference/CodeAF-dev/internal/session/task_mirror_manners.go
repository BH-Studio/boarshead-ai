// A LANDING DOES NOT WRITE OVER A FILE THAT CHANGED UNDER IT.
//
// ── WHAT THIS REPAIRS ──
//
// A folder family works in a private copy of the person's folder for as long as
// the work takes, and lays its ledger back over that folder at the end
// (task_run.go's [mirrorGround] and [taskTree.landMirror], task_audit.go's
// [layWork]). The laying is `RemoveAll` and copy, and nothing anywhere recorded
// what those files looked like when the copy was made — so an edit the person
// made in their own folder while the work ran was overwritten, silently, with
// nothing in the report, the card or the job log to say it had happened. Since
// the late roads became real (#237) the window is not one run but one morning: a
// family that settled needing a look is laid over the folder when somebody types
// `accept` hours later, from a ledger recorded before lunch.
//
// This is the folder ground's half of what git already does for a repository
// ground, where a person's own edit to a file the branch touches is exactly what
// makes the merge refuse. So the answer is the same answer, in the folder's own
// words: the changed files are NAMED and NOTHING IS LAID.
//
// ── WHY THE BASELINE IS ITS OWN RECORD ──
//
// The family tree's baseline commit is byte-exact and free where it exists
// (task_tree_mirror.go's [openFamilyRepository] commits the mirror as it stands
// the moment it is carved), and being asked to use it is the right question to
// ask: one source of truth beats two files. It is not used, for one reason. That
// commit exists only where `git init` succeeded, and the family whose init
// failed is the DEGRADED one — the read-only disk, the machine with no git,
// the folder somebody moved — whose parts already share a directory and which is
// the last family that should also leave without a manners check. A road that
// covers four families out of five is a road somebody has to remember the shape
// of; this one is asked at every landing and answers for all of them. It is also
// the cheaper reading at the moment it matters: comparing one ledger path costs
// one digest of one file, where the commit would cost a `git` process per
// landing in a directory whose history is the family's medium rather than the
// person's.
//
// So the folder as it stood is written down beside the copy, in the tree's own
// private corner, exactly as the leavings snapshot already is (task_run.go's
// [rememberLeftBehind] pair): it survives a dead process, an accept the next
// morning and a re-audit, and not a byte of it reaches the checkpoint, which is
// rewritten as the graph moves and has no business carrying twenty thousand
// digests.
//
// ── AND ABSENCE IS ORDINARY ──
//
// A folder with no record is a folder from an older build, or one this could not
// read in full, and it lands exactly as it landed before this file existed. A
// manners check that turned a missing file into a refusal would make every
// family carried across an upgrade need somebody's look.
//
// AND THE WINDOW IS NARROWED, NOT CLOSED. A plain folder has nothing to lock, so
// the milliseconds between the last comparison and the copy that follows it
// belong to whoever writes first — exactly as they do for git, which reads its
// index and then writes the working tree. What this changes is the size of the
// window a person can lose work in: it was the whole of a run, and a whole
// morning on the late roads.
