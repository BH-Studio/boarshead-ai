// ── ONE READING BESIDE THE WORK ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A SIDECAR is a reading this harness makes on its own behalf while the person's
// work carries on: which remembered lines this message needs, what is left of a
// long answer, whether what somebody typed was really a job for a task. None of
// them is anything anybody asked for, and loop.go's law is that none of them may
// ever stand in front of the work — they run BESIDE it, and the only power they
// have over it is to INTERRUPT it.
//
// THERE IS ONE MECHANISM FOR THAT SHAPE AND THIS IS IT. There were four, and
// that is the whole reason this file exists: route_judge.go's race, the memory
// pass awaited as a line of the turn, the mark's reader awaited as another, and
// the post-turn cascade awaited as a third — three of them ad-hoc goroutines or
// straight-line calls with their own idea of what a cancelled reading means, and
// one of them (the race) the shape all four should have had. A reading that is
// its own goroutine with its own channel is a reading whose cancellation, whose
// one-answer rule and whose "has it landed yet" test are written again by
// whoever adds the next one, and the next one is where they get written wrong.
//
// THE LAW IS THREE VERBS, and every caller uses all three:
//
//	START  where the question first becomes askable — as early as possible,
//	       because everything the work does between here and the answer is
//	       latency the reading hides behind.
//	TAKE   where the answer can still be SPENT, and never anywhere else. It is
//	       non-blocking by construction: a reading still in flight costs the
//	       caller one closed-channel test and is asked again at its next chance.
//	END    where nobody can spend it any more. It does not wait for the
//	       goroutine — a caller that waited here for a provider to notice a
//	       cancelled context would have moved the wait to the other end of the
//	       turn — and the reading is bounded by its own window either way.
//
// [sidecar.takeAtTheEnd] is the fourth verb and it is the exception rather than
// the rule: it WAITS. It exists for the one moment a reading has nothing to run
// beside — the end of a turn, after the model has stopped writing — and IT IS
// NAMED FOR THE ONLY CONDITION UNDER WHICH IT IS HONEST so that the law can
// find it: sidecar_law_test.go holds every call to it to the same ending-road
// property it holds an awaited reading to, and nothing else in this package is
// spelled that way. There is exactly one other reading in this package that must precede
// the work rather than ride beside it, and it is named in loop.go's header and
// in guardian.go: the safety gate, which decides whether a tool RUNS and so has
// nothing to be applied to afterwards.
//
// AND A READING MAY NOT BLOCK. `act` runs on the sidecar's own goroutine the
// instant the answer lands, and what it is for is the interruption: cutting the
// generation in flight (steer.go's [Agent.cutGeneration]) so that the boundary
// where the answer can be spent arrives at once rather than whenever the step
// happens to end. Anything slower than that belongs in the caller's `take`.
//
// AND THE ANSWER AND ITS INTERRUPTION ARE ONE FACT. An `act` that had been
// delivered while the answer was still unreadable was the whole of #956: the cut
// landed, the step unwound, the loop arrived at the boundary the cut had just
// bought — and `take`, which is non-blocking by construction, read the reading as
// still in flight and let that boundary pass. The turn then paid for a whole
// extra step, and where that step was its last, a drawing that said the work had
// independent parts in it was written down as a carry-on. So the answer is
// PUBLISHED FIRST and the interruption is delivered after it, and the two are
// ordered against the taker by one claim ([sidecar.spent]) rather than by which
// goroutine happens to be running.

// sidecar is one reading running beside the work. T is whatever the reading
// answers with; a caller that wants no answer at all uses struct{}.
//
// THE ANSWER IS WRITTEN ONCE AND READ AFTER. `settled` closing is the whole of
// the synchronisation: the goroutine writes `answer` before it closes the
// channel, every reader reads it afterwards, and there is no lock because there
// is nothing left to contend for. `taken` is touched only by the caller's own
// goroutine, which is the one place the ONE-ANSWER rule is decided.

	// writing down what ran beside its work can still say so after spending it.
	// It is an atomic because the decomposition row is written by the turn while
	// a late reading may still be finishing.
	asked atomic.Bool
	// spent GATES THE INTERRUPTION AND DOES NOT ORDER THE TAKE. A taker stores it
	// and takes; the interruption is delivered only if it claims it FIRST. So an
	// answer that has already reached a boundary raises no interruption, and a
	// taker never waits for one.
	//
	// An `act` exists to bring the boundary where the answer can be spent FORWARD.
	// An answer that has ALREADY REACHED a boundary has nothing left for one to
	// bring, and an interruption raised after that would land on whatever the turn
	// does next — which is the hazard the old act-before-settle order was reaching
	// for and paid for with #956's dropped drawing. Claiming it here costs one
	// atomic on each side and needs no lock, so `take` stays the closed-channel
	// test loop.go's law requires it to be.
	//
	// IT IS A GATE AND NOT A FENCE, and the difference is the width of one
	// instruction: between the settle closing and the claim being made, an
	// interruption can still win the claim while a taker at that same boundary
	// takes anyway. Nothing is lost when that happens — the answer is spent — but
	// a cut raised for an answer already spent is a cut nobody needs, so the door
	// that owes it drops it when the boundary it was owed for has arrived without
	// it (steer.go's [Agent.dropOwedCut]).
	spent atomic.Bool
}

// readBeside starts one reading beside the work.
//
// ctx is the WORK'S OWN context, so a reading cannot outlive the thing it was
// read for; the reading gets a child of it that [sidecar.end] closes.
//
// ask is the reading. It is given the sidecar's context and must respect it.
//
// act is OPTIONAL and is the reading's one power over the work: it is called on
// this goroutine the instant the answer lands and it is where an interruption is
// raised. It must be as cheap as a stream observer. Nil is the ordinary case —
// most readings simply wait to be taken.
//
// IT RUNS AFTER THE ANSWER IS TAKEABLE, and the order is load-bearing rather
// than incidental. What `act` does is bring the moment the answer can be spent
// FORWARD — cutting the request in flight so the next boundary arrives at once —
// and the taker that then arrives at that boundary is non-blocking by
// construction. So an answer published only once `act` had RETURNED was an
// answer the boundary its own cut opened could read as still in flight, which is
// #956: the cut was paid for and bought nothing. The settle therefore closes
// first, and [sidecar.spent] is what keeps the interruption from being delivered
// into a turn that has already spent the answer without it.
//
// AND A READING THAT HAS BEEN LET GO OF INTERRUPTS NOTHING. [sidecar.end] cancels
// this context, and a cancelled reading that answers anyway — because `ask` was
// already on its way back — must not reach into a turn that has stopped waiting
// for it: a cut raised there would land on whatever generation came NEXT.

// ── AND HOW A LANDING IS SEEN WITHOUT RACING IT ─────────────────────────────
//
// A reading lands whenever the scheduler lets it, and nothing in this package
// may wait for one on the work's behalf; that is this file's law. A TEST that
// pins an order between a reading and the work still has to know when the
// reading has landed, and it cannot learn that from the calls it answered. An
// answered call is a reading that has still to parse, act and settle, and a
// reading the work started a moment ago may not have been scheduled at all: a
// scripted conversation answers in no time and never blocks, so the goroutine
// the turn has just started waits behind it for as many rounds as the machine
// is busy. Every fixture that guessed (a count of the calls entered, a script
// long enough on a quiet machine) was green alone and red beside another suite.
//
// SO THE DOOR SAYS. A watch carried on the work's context is told by
// [readBeside] itself when each reading under it starts and when it has landed,
// and [besideWatch.quiet] waits until none is in flight. It is [desk.settled]'s
// bargain for the other half of this file: THE RUNNING PRODUCT CARRIES NO WATCH
// AND NEVER WAITS ON ONE (sidecar_law_test.go holds it to that), and a context
// without a watch costs a reading one lookup.

// besideWatch counts the readings in flight under one context.
type besideWatch struct {
	mu     sync.Mutex
	flying int
	// calm is made on demand by [besideWatch.quiet] and closed when the last
	// reading in flight lands, so a watch nobody waits on allocates nothing.
	calm chan struct{}

// cancellation is counted until the call returns — and an unbounded wait here
// would park the next caller forever and report as a package timeout naming

// ── AND THE OTHER HALF: TELLING SOMEBODY WITHOUT WAITING FOR THEM ───────────
//
// [readBeside] keeps the WORK from waiting on a reading. A desk keeps the work
// from waiting on a LISTENER, which is the same law read from the other end and
// was a measured hole in it: every phase this package posts — and every phase
// the transport posts, which arrives by this same door (phasenews.go's
// [forwardPhase]) — was handed to the surface's reader ON THE CALLING
// GOROUTINE, and internal/tui3's reader asks Bubble Tea for a frame through an
// UNBUFFERED channel. So the last act of every model call, `phase.done()`, paid
// a whole Update-and-View cycle before the engine goroutine got its own call
// back. On every call, not only a cancelled one. `postPhaseNews` and
// `postLaneNews` both said in their own doc comments that they never block on a
// slow reader, and both of them did.
//
// THE LAW IS: THE PRODUCER LEAVES THE NEWS AND WALKS AWAY. internal/provider's
// phase.go already names the division — "the one live reader hands the news to
// a desk and asks for a frame" — and this is the desk. A listener is told on the
// desk's own goroutine, IN THE ORDER IT WAS TOLD, and at most one such goroutine
// is alive per desk at a time: it is started by the telling that finds the desk
// empty and it returns when the desk is empty again.
//
// NOTHING IS COALESCED AND NOTHING IS DROPPED. A phase is a state and a
// latest-wins slot would serve it, but lane news is a LEDGER and dropping one of
// those loses a request nobody can count again — so the queue is honest and the
// bound on it is the listener's own appetite. A listener that never returns
// holds one goroutine and a growing slice, which is a listener that is broken in
// a way this package cannot fix and must not hide.

// desk is somewhere to leave news for a listener who may be slow.
