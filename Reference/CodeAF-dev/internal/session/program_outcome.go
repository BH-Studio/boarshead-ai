// A PROGRAM'S ENDING IS FOR CODEAF TO ACT ON, NOT FOR THE PERSON TO DECODE.
//
// senior-dev ends with a status — its change passed the project's own build and
// tests, nothing finished checking it, it did not pass, it hit a ceiling, it
// broke — and until this file that status was a sentence on a row and in the
// conversation's record, read by the model only if the person happened to ask
// something next. The owner asked on 2026-09-25 that the status inform codeaf
// rather than the person: the chat reads it the moment the run ends, checks
// what it can, sends senior-dev back with a sharper brief when the work did not
// stand, and tells the person where the work is in one plain summary.
//
// So every program run's landing WAKES a bounded turn ([Agent.deliverBeltRunLanding])
// carrying the ending as a fact ([programVerdict]) and the one line of what to
// do about it, under a role page that says the whole playbook
// (prompts/program-outcome.md) — the per-event vehicle, which costs the fixed
// prefix nothing.
//
// TWO BOUNDS ARE CODE, NOT ADVICE. codeaf sends a program back on its own at
// most [programAutoRetries] times in a line of runs on one piece of work, and
// never after a run that ended on a dollar or time ceiling: that re-run spends
// more of the person's money, so it waits for their word ([Agent.programRetryRefusal]).
// A hand-off the person asks for in their own turn is theirs, and starts the
// count again.
