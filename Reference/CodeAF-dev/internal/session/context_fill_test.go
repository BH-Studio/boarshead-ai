// ── A PINNED FILL IS HONOURED, AND AN UNTOUCHED ONE IS NOT ──────────────────
//
// `--context-fill` has existed and been documented as the compaction fill point
// since long before the derivation in window_policy_test.go next door, and the
// conversation's trigger read it nowhere: the fill law could not tell a sixty
// somebody typed from the sixty it ships with, so honouring the number would
// have dropped every session's fold line from the derived ~85% of its window to
// 60% — the exact regression the derivation was written to end.
//
// What makes honouring it safe is provenance, and the settings registry already
// carried it: an environment pin on the row, or a value written down in the
// profile. These tests pin both halves of the resulting law.

// pinFill puts a fill percentage in force for one test the way `--context-fill`
// does — it sets the environment variable that flag sets — and t.Setenv puts it
// back afterwards, so no other test in this package inherits a pinned law.
