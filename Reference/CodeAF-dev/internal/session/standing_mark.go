// A DRAFT THE PERSON MARKED STANDING — the deterministic half of the ambient
// side's recognition problem.
//
// tools_standing.go's description is the other half, and it is the half that
// FAILS SILENTLY: it asks the model to notice that an ordinary sentence was a
// standing one, and a model that does not notice does the sentence as one-off
// work. The person watches something happen, believes a rule was made, and
// walks away from a machine that is holding nothing. Nothing on the screen says
// otherwise, because from the outside a recognised sentence and a missed one
// look identical.
//
// So there is a gesture that takes the noticing out of it. The surface's draft
// box has a chord that means "keep this true" (internal/tui3's standmark.go),
// and a sentence sent that way arrives here carrying [standingMarkInstruction]
// in front of it. The model is no longer being asked to spot anything: it is
// being told what the person did, and what it must do about it.
//
// ── THE LAWS THIS FILE APPLIES ──
//
//   - IT IS AN INSTRUCTION AND NEVER AN ARGUMENT. Nothing here calls `stand`,
//     fills a card in or arms an item; the model still compiles the when, the
//     does, the altitude and the title out of the sentence exactly as it does
//     when it recognised one on its own, and the card the person answers is the
//     ordinary ratification card. NOTHING STANDS UNTIL THEY SAY YES is
//     standing_contract.go's law and this door does not touch it.
//
//   - A MARKED SENTENCE IS NEVER DONE AS ORDINARY WORK. That is the whole
//     invariant. "Run the tests whenever I push" marked standing must not be a
//     test run; a sentence that cannot stand at all — "what time is it?" — is
//     answered with one line saying so and nothing else, because doing it
//     anyway is exactly the silent failure the gesture exists to end.
//
//   - THE PERSON NEVER SEES IT. The instruction rides in the message this turn
//     reasons from and nowhere else: [Agent.recordUserLocked] journals their own
//     sentence, so a resume, an export and the transcript on screen all show
//     what they typed.
//
//   - AND IT IS ABSENT WHERE IT CANNOT WORK. With no store behind the ambient
//     side the `stand` verb is not on the belt at all (tools_standing.go), so an
//     instruction to shape a proposal would be an instruction to reach for a
//     verb the model has not got. The door refuses instead, before anything is
//     journaled, on [Agent.SubmitImage]'s terms: nothing was recorded, nothing
//     was queued, and the person still holds their words.

//
// It names the tool and the op because it is the one message on this surface
// that may: everything else about `stand` is recognition, and the model must
// arrive at the verb itself. Here the verb is settled and what is left is the
