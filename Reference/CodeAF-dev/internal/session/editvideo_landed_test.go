// A MEASUREMENT IS NOT A LANDING.
//
// edit_video is on [savingTools] because a node ordered to land the film it has
// been cutting must still be handed the joining verb. But the map answers for a
// VERB and three readers were asking it about a CALL, and the verb's fourth
// action writes nothing: a standing firing whose whole night's work was
// `{"action":"measure"}` reported as landed — the one outcome the sweep may
// never reap, so its run folder was kept for ever — and a node measuring the
// same clip over and over had every measurement counted as the work moving,
// which is precisely the spin the counter exists to catch.
//
// [producedAFile] is the answer both of them ask now, and these are the two
// readers held to it.
