// TWO DEFECTS FROM ONE REAL RUN, PINNED.
//
// A person asked for a research report on 18 August. The run's twelve nodes all
// landed by 19:41 and the root row in the project index still said "running" at
// nine that evening, through a restart of the whole program. Underneath it, one
// brief — "write the final report to research/ai-dev-startups-2026.md" — had
// been handed to EIGHT successive workers, every one of which came back "done"
// with a sentence like "Now I have both files. Let me write the synthesized
// report." and a file that was never written.
//
// The tests below are the two halves of that: a row that can never sit saying
// "running" once nothing is running it, and a run that stops handing out a brief
// that keeps coming back empty.

// ── a run that ended is a run the project's record says ended ───────────────

// A SETTLED RUN CLOSES ITS OWN ROW. The root takes a row saying "running" the
// moment it is minted, because a run somebody can watch has to be in the list
// they are watching. That row is a promise, and this is the promise kept in the
// ordinary case: the run ends inside the process that started it.
