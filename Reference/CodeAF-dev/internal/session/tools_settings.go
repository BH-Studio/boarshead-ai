// The settings hands: the person's own configuration, read back and changed.
//
// "Use deepseek for planning", "stop drawing timestamps", "make my daily budget
// five dollars" are all sentences a person says to the chat and, until now, had
// to go and do themselves in /settings. These two tools close that: the model
// can read the sheet and write one row of it, permanently, into the same
// config.json the panel writes, so the change survives a restart and shows in
// the panel next time it is opened.
//
// THE REGISTRY IS THE ONLY VOCABULARY. Everything here goes through
// internal/config's settings registry — a row is found by its own key, read
// through its own reader, and written through its own validated writer
// ([config.Setting.Apply], which is the exact call the panel makes). This file
// contains no key names, no json field names, no parsers and no defaults. It
// CANNOT write a raw value into the config file and it cannot invent a row: a
// key the registry does not have is a refusal that names the near misses, the
// way a good CLI answers a mistyped flag, and never a write to a key nobody
// declared. The reason is one-source-of-truth rather than tidiness — a settings
// tool that wrote json would be a second definition of every knob in the
// product, drifting the day somebody widens a validator.
//
// THE SAFETY ROWS ARE NOT SELF-SERVICE, and the list of them lives beside the
// rows in internal/config's selfservice.go rather than here
// ([config.Setting.SelfService]). The tool gate, the shell rules, the spend
// rails, the machine ceilings, the work audit, the attribution trailer and every
// credential row are refused with a sentence naming the row and pointing at
// /settings.
//
// TWO TOOLS AND NOT ONE WITH ACTIONS, and this is the one decision here worth
// arguing. Every other multi-verb hand on this belt — jobs, tasks, use_service —
// is one tool with an action argument, and the shape is better for a model to
// hold. It is the wrong shape here for a reason that has nothing to do with
// ergonomics: THE APPROVAL GATE KEYS ON THE TOOL NAME. internal/approval's rules
// are per tool (config.KeyToolApprovals is `read:allow, bash:prompt`), so a
// single `settings` tool carrying both verbs would offer the person exactly one
// answer for two different acts — "settings:allow" to stop being asked about
// reading their own configuration would silently hand over the right to rewrite
// it. Split, the read can sit on the builtin floor (cmd/codeaf's
// v3BuiltinApprovals) where manual and jobs already sit, and every write goes to
// the person like any other acting tool. One tool would have made that
// impossible to express.
