// Package splitgate is the enumeration evidence gate: does a piece of work name
// enough independent items for dividing it to beat one worker doing them in
// order?
//
// AND SINCE 2026-09-02 IT ASKS ONLY WHEN SOMEBODY ASKS IT TO. The gate shipped
// armed under a six-item floor, and a designed experiment — four planner arms
// against four readings of this gate, 273 judged draws on the plan door — put
// the planner with the gate OFF on the front and left every armed reading
// behind it (docs/design/plan-gate-doe/REPORT.md). So an unpinned binary keeps
// every division the planner drew, and the counting below decides only where
// somebody has pinned `CODEAF_SPLITGATE=1` or `judgment`. modes.go holds the
// pin and the reasoning; everything else in this file is the counting itself,
// which the experiment did not change and which arming still reads
// (internal/session's enumeratesWidth).
//
// IT IS ONE ANSWER, ASKED IN THREE PLACES. The gate was written for the
// resident's planner and its leaves (cmd/codeaf/cooperative.go) and measured
// against the swarm bench corpus, where it reproduced the empirically best
// arm's decision on every task in the table: twelve image files and eight
// endpoints divided, four modules and three bugs did not. The v3 session engine
// now asks the same question of a task's own work (internal/session's
// task_divide.go), and a second implementation of it would be a second answer —
// the fault CLAUDE.md's one-source-of-truth law names, applied to a decision
// instead of to a number. So the counting lives here, with no dependency on
// either product, and both call it.
//
// IT COSTS NOTHING. There is no model call in this package and there never
// should be: the gate is asked on every division request and on every task
// admission, and a gate that spent money to say no would be more expensive than
// the division it refused.
//
// AND IT FAILS OPEN ON WORDS IT HAS NEVER MET. The first counter carried a
// list of eighteen item-nouns and counted a number only beside one of them,
// which read "34 person-rows" and "34 research targets" as nothing at all — a
// live OSINT task was twice told its thirty-four people were zero items, on
// the honest evidence, because nobody doing that work writes "files". A list
// of the things people have piles of is open-ended and always behind the next
// domain. What is CLOSED is the opposite list: the measures, budgets and
// repetitions whose number sizes one thing rather than counting many — words,
// seconds, retries, steps. So the gate now counts a number beside any plural
// word that is not a measure, and an unfamiliar domain errs toward counting,
// with the paid reviewer behind the gate as the check on what it lets through
// (task_divide.go reads every division before admitting it).
