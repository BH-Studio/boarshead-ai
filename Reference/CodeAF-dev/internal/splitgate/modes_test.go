// type. Then a designed experiment ran four planner arms against four readings
// of this gate over 273 judged plan draws, and the front it drew is the stages
// planner with the gate having NO SAY — same quality as the best armed cell,
// a third of its unrecoverable draws, the lowest cost of the front
// (docs/design/plan-gate-doe/REPORT.md). So the default is off, and the count
