// and the table below is the decision it made on each of them — the same
// decision the empirically best arm of the A/B made (bench/swarm/AB-REPORT.md).
// It used to be logged and not asserted, which meant the counting could be
// changed by anybody and nothing would go red; now that a second product asks
// this same question (internal/session's task_divide.go) an unasserted table is
// a measurement two roads can silently drift away from.
