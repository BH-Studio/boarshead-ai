// Which reading of "is this division real" a run is on.
//
// THE GATE IS OFF UNLESS SOMEBODY PINNED IT ON. It shipped armed, with a
// six-item floor under every division, and issue #418 said the floor folds real
// divisions: a brief that names three lanes over one file counts zero items and
// is refused. Two repairs were proposed and neither was argued to a conclusion,
// so the owner ruled that the choice would be made by a designed experiment —
// four planner arms against four readings of this gate, 273 judged draws on the
// plan door (docs/design/plan-gate-doe/REPORT.md).
//
// THE EXPERIMENT PICKED THE GATE OFF. The front it drew is the stages planner
// with this gate having no say: the same quality as the best armed cell, the
// fewest divisions the tests could not recover (4 of 21 against 12 and 18), and
// the lowest cost. Every armed reading paid for the narrow divisions it refused
// by folding wide ones, and the counting repair helped one planner and hurt
// another — an interaction, not an improvement. So on 2026-09-02 the default
// moved: with nothing pinned, every division the planner drew is kept.
//
// THE COUNT AND THE SIZING STAY REACHABLE AS PINS. The experiment measured
// them, they are not wrong everywhere, and a run that wants the shipped floor
// back should not need a build to get it — but neither is now what a person
// gets without asking.

// GateMode is which reading of "is this division real" the binary is running.
// It is a string rather than an integer because the pin is read by people
// typing it in front of a command, and `CODEAF_SPLITGATE=judgment` says what it
// is doing where `CODEAF_SPLITGATE=3` would not.

	// ModeCount is the gate as it shipped until 2026-09-02: [Items] over the

	// ModeJudgment is #418's other repair — stop reading the brief. The planner
	// has already sized every node and drawn the edges between them, so the
	// gate asks that instead: a division whose work leaves are each a sitting
	// and which owe each other nothing is a real division whatever the brief
	// counted.
	//
	// IT ONLY EVER ADDS KEEPS TO THE COUNT. When the plan's sizing does not say
	// yes — a leaf with no size, a leaf still oversized, or any edge between two
	// leaves — the count decides, exactly as in [ModeCount]. So this pin is the
	// count with a second way to say yes, which is what let the experiment read
	// it as one factor against the count rather than as a different gate.

// had to leave a run on the shipped gate, because the danger was a typo
// silently moving somebody onto an experimental arm. Now the danger runs the
// other way: the measured behaviour is the gate having no say, and a typo
// (`CODEAF_SPLITGATE=on`, `CODEAF_SPLITGATE=true`, `CODEAF_SPLITGATE=lanes`
// from the experiment that has since ended) must not quietly put a floor back
// under somebody's divisions. So the two words that arm it are exact, and
// everything else — including nothing at all — is off.
