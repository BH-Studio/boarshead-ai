// HOW MUCH of a project one reading covers, and why that is decided before the
// clock is consulted rather than after.
//
// textual's whole-repository reading collects 3,422 tests and takes 793 seconds,
// measured in its own task image. The wall it was given afforded 5m30s. So the
// reading was started, killed at its ceiling, named nothing, and cost an eighth
// of the run — and every round of that job inherited the same refusal. The
// budget was doing exactly what it was written to do; what was missing is that
// NOTHING HAD DECIDED WHAT TO MEASURE BEFORE DECIDING HOW LONG TO MEASURE IT.
//
// A reading exists to answer two questions about ONE piece of work: which checks
// exist near it, and which of them this work broke. Neither question is asked of
// the four hundred test files the work never went near. So the ladder is scoped
// first and bounded second: the checks adjacent to the change, then — only if
// there is still budget for it — the whole suite. A scoped reading of the right
// forty checks is a better answer than a whole reading that was killed, and it
// is a strictly better answer than no reading at all, which is what the whole
// rung actually returned.
//
// THE SCOPE IS PART OF THE READING'S IDENTITY. Two readings only subtract when
// they are readings of the same thing: a before reading of the whole suite minus
// an after reading of three files is a hundred checks that "disappeared" and a
// finding about nothing. The scope therefore rides on Strategy, which is pinned
// on the first reading and re-used verbatim for the second — see RunReading —
// and it is journaled, so an autopsy reading a roster of forty knows whether it
// is looking at a small project or at a scoped reading of a large one.

// It exists because happy-dom s8 took its whole reading at the repository root
// and never once looked at `packages/happy-dom`, where the work was. Nothing was
// wrong with the workspace declaration or with the nearest-manifest walk: THE
// FOCUS WAS EMPTY. A focus was derived only from paths a request spells out, and
// that request spells out none — it says "Implement `observe()`, `unobserve()`,
// `disconnect()` and `takeRecords()`", names `IntersectionObserver` and
// `IntersectionObserverEntry`, and never writes a single path. So no package was
// touched as far as the reader knew, the ladder had only root rungs, and the
// root's `npx vitest run` was killed at its ceiling naming nothing.
//
// A request that names a thing this repository has a FILE for is a request about
// that file, and that is a structural fact rather than a guess. Three ways a
// name resolves, all of them whole-name equality and none of them a substring:
//
//   - a path the workspace holds outright;
//   - a bare file name, resolved to wherever the workspace keeps it;
//   - a distinctive identifier whose spelling IS a source file's name under the
//     ecosystem's own convention — `IntersectionObserver` is
//     `IntersectionObserver.ts`, and `RichLog` is `_rich_log.py`, because
//     CamelCase and snake_case are two spellings of one name and a leading
//     underscore is Python's mark for a private module.
//
// And a fourth, which is a place rather than a file: A DIRECTORY THE REQUEST
// SPELLS AND THE WORKSPACE HOLDS IS A SUBJECT, and the package it is stands as
// the scope of the reading. `go test ./internal/subharness/ -count=1` names one

// narrows back to, because that is the smallest selection that is still a
