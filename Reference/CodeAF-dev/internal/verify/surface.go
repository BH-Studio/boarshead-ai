// deleted eight public class attributes off `Igel` — `results_path` and its
// seven siblings — and moved them onto instances set in `__init__`. No check the
// project owns touches any of them, so the reading of the finished tree was an
// IMPROVEMENT: named 2 → 14, red 2 → 0. All twenty-four hidden tests failed at
// setup on `Igel.results_path`, and nothing in the run said a word.
//
// A CHECK IS EVIDENCE THAT SOMETHING IS EXERCISED; IT IS NOT EVIDENCE THAT
// NOTHING ELSE EXISTS. The public surface is the half a suite cannot see: a name
// that was there before the work and is gone after it is a fact about the world,
// measured twice, with no model in the loop and no citation to weigh.
//
// It is read BY LANGUAGE SHAPE and never by a list of names — FAILSAFE.md clause
// 1 — and it is deliberately CONSERVATIVE. Everything here reports only what it
// can read with certainty; what it cannot parse it does not guess at, because
// the cost of a name invented here is a false blocker on real work, and the cost
// of a name missed is the state this file was written in.
