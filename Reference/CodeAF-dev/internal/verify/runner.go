// HOW a reading is taken, as opposed to WHAT is run.
//
// discovery.go answers "what command does this project say checks it". That
// question turned out to be one half of a reading, and the missing half cost a
// whole sweep. On 2026-08-29 five graded runs took five readings and named ZERO
// checks between them. ofetch's is the whole story in one line: the project
// declares `pnpm test`, whose body is a lint step and a typecheck step and THEN
// vitest, so a formatting complaint exits 1 before the suite runs at all — and
// the gate, reading that, said "the project's own verification exited 1 and
// named 0 checks", which is true of the script and says nothing whatever about
// the tests. The acceptance mapping then had an empty roster to map fifty-two
// stated behaviours onto, and raised nothing.
//
// The structural fact the old reading ignored is that A PROJECT'S TEST SCRIPT IS
// NOT ITS TEST RUNNER. The script is a lifecycle: it may lint, typecheck, build
// and then run checks, and only the last of those names identities. The runner
// underneath it is a program that can be ASKED for a machine-readable account of
// every check it ran — vitest and jest print JSON, go test prints JSON, pytest
// prints a named line per check when asked for one, mocha speaks TAP. So the
// reading is taken from the RUNNER's own output, and the runner is found in what
// the project itself declares: the body of its own test script, its manifest's
// dependencies, its runner's config file, its lockfile.
//
// Nothing here is a per-project list and nothing here knows what any benchmark
// contains. A runner is recognised the way a check declaration is in roster.go —
// by the shape of what the repository declares — and every strategy falls back
// to the shared PASS/FAIL vocabulary over the same bytes, so a runner nobody
// here has met is read exactly as well as it was before this file existed.

// ReadingStrategies is the ladder of ways this project's checks can be read,
// most specific first.
//
// There is a ladder because the most specific rung can fail in a way that says
// nothing about the suite. textual's own `make test` is `poetry run pytest
// tests/ -n 16 --dist=loadgroup` and the task image has no pytest-xdist, so that
// invocation exits in eight seconds on `unrecognized arguments: -n` — a reading
// that names nothing, of a suite that was never asked to run. A reader with one
// rung takes that for the whole answer; a reader with a ladder drops to the
// runner's own invocation and reads the suite.
//
// The ladder has two dimensions, and both of them are "most specific first".
//
// WHERE, from [Members]. A monorepo's root command is a fan-out: happy-dom's
// `npm test` is `turbo run test`, which at an uncompiled base commit dies inside
// turbo having named no check of any package, while the runner that names its
// 7,260 checks sits in packages/happy-dom's own manifest. So the packages the
// work touched are read first, most-touched first, and the root is the last
// place tried rather than the only one. A project that declares no workspace
// has exactly one place and this dimension collapses to nothing.
//
// HOW MUCH, from [Adjacent]. Inside each place the SCOPED rung comes first — the
// runner handed the checks that sit next to the change — and the whole-suite
// rungs come after it. textual's whole-repository reading collects 3,422 tests
// and takes 793 seconds against a budget of 5m30s, so the whole rung was the
// only rung and it never returned an answer at all.
//
// The rungs within one place, and why they are in this order:
//
//  1. The runner, handed the checks adjacent to the change. It is built from the
//     runner's OWN invocation rather than from the project's script, because
//     what is being replaced is the project's own scope — appending a selection
//     to a command that already names `tests/` selects both.
//  2. The runner as the PROJECT'S OWN script or recipe invokes it, with the
//     project's flags kept. This is the most faithful whole reading there is,
//     and it is the only rung that knows the project scoped its suite to
//     `tests/`.
//  3. The runner as it invokes itself, taken from what the project declares it
//     depends on and configures. It drops the project's flags, which is the
//     point: a flag that needs a plugin the environment lacks is what put us
//     here.
//  4. The project's declared entrypoint, run as it stands and read as plain
//     text. This is what every reading in this program was before strategies
//     existed, and it is the floor rather than an absence of one.
//
// Identical rungs are collapsed, so a project whose script already spells the
// runner plainly produces one strategy and one reading.
//
// ok is false exactly when there was nothing anywhere to run.
