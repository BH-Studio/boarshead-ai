// Taking the first reading, and saying why when there isn't one.
//
// NOBODY LOOKED IS A FACT, AND A FACT ABOUT THE RUN REACHES THE RECORD. The
// first version of this had four ways to return no reading — no entrypoint, a
// wall that could not afford one, a shell the preamble cannot be trusted in, a
// command killed at its ceiling — and all four returned the same zero value
// silently. textual's s6 run hit the fourth: the bare leaf spent five minutes
// and twenty-seven seconds of its wall on a reading that was killed, then made
// its first model call, and the finished store held no row saying any of it had
// happened. From outside it was indistinguishable from a project that declares
// no verification at all, which is the opposite diagnosis.
//
// So there is one entry point, it always returns a Reading, and a Reading that
// was not taken carries the sentence saying why and the command it would have
// run. FAILSAFE.md clause 4.

// before anything has changed it.
//
// It walks the strategy ladder (see [ReadingStrategies]) inside ONE budget. A
// rung that names nothing has told us nothing about the suite — textual's own
// `make test` exits in eight seconds on a pytest plugin the image does not have
// — so the next rung is tried with whatever budget is left. The LAST rung's
// answer is taken whatever it named, because a runner that genuinely reports no
// identities is a real reading with an empty roster, and treating that as no
// reading is the exact short-circuit that let fifty-two stated behaviours go
// unasked.
//
// focus is what this job is about, and it is what decides HOW MUCH of the
// project each rung reads — see scope.go. An empty focus is a job that named
// nothing, and every rung of its ladder is a reading of the whole project,
// which is what every reading here was before scopes existed.
