// What a check ASSERTS, as opposed to what it merely mentions.
//
// The surface reader beside this one answers "what names does this file spell".
// That question is not enough to settle whether a check exercises a behaviour: a
// check that CALLS `write("short", expand=True)` and then asserts only that the
// widget has more than zero lines spells `expand` and weighs nothing about it.
// textual s13 wrote three such checks, every one of them mapped to a stated
// behaviour, and shipped at exit 0 with the hidden check for that exact
// behaviour red (docs/design/gate/ACCEPTANCE.md).
//
// So this reads the other half: for each check a file declares, the TEXT OF ITS
// ASSERTION STATEMENTS and nothing else — the lines that would fail if what they
// weigh were wrong. Everything outside an assertion is setup, and setup is what
// a check mentions rather than what it checks.
//
// It is a reader of SHAPE, one per language, in the register the rest of this
// package reads in: declaration-level, conservative, and silent where it is not
// sure. A file in a language with no reader here, or a check whose declaration
// this cannot find, comes back UNKNOWN rather than empty — the difference
// between "nothing is asserted" and "nobody looked" is the whole of what the
// door downstream is allowed to act on.
