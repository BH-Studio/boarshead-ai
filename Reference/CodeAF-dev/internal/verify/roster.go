// Reading a suite's whole roster, and reading a diff for the checks it declares.
//
// failing.go answers "what is red". This answers the two questions the delivery
// gate needs that redness cannot: WHAT CHECKS EXIST AT ALL, and WHICH CHECKS
// THIS CHANGE ADDED OR REMOVED. Both were unanswerable, and the cost of that is
// measured: two graded runs shipped at exit 0 on deliverables claiming every
// test passed, over hidden failures in behaviours the request stated and the
// leaf's own test file never exercised (docs/design/gate/ACCEPTANCE.md).
//
// Nothing here knows what language the workspace is in, and nothing here is a
// gate. A check is recognised by SHAPE — the punctuation and keywords a check
// declaration is built out of in every ecosystem this program has met — never by
// a list of frameworks, which is the failure FAILSAFE's first clause is about.

// DeclaredChecks names every check a body of text declares, in the order it

// question at all.
//
// Its names are CHECK IDENTITIES — read out of source by declaredIdentity,
// which is CheckIdentity's own reading with the one difference source makes:
// nothing here is a nesting chain, so `it("renders a > b")` declares `renders a
// > b` and not `b`. Source carries no import path, no class and no node id to
// qualify a declaration with, so a declaration is otherwise already bare;
// passing it through that reading is what makes this a stated law rather than a
// coincidence, and it is what lets the caller that matters deduplicate these
// names against a runner's roster and get one entry per check
// (internal/revision/acceptance.go, verify.UniqueChecks).

// that promised declaration order over a body that sorted was two statements
