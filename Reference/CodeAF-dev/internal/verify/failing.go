// Nothing here knows what language the workspace is in. It does not run the

// own failure vocabulary, which is small, stable, and shared across every
// ecosystem this program has met.

// CheckIdentity is WHICH CHECK A NAME NAMES, and it is the only place in this

//
// A CHECK HAS ONE IDENTITY. The same check is read twice by different readers —
// out of a runner's output by ReportedTests and FailingTests, out of its own
// source by DeclaredChecks — and those two readings are put together: the gate
// unions the checks a run DECLARED with the checks the suite REPORTED to ask
// what the change covers, and unions the declarations a diff REMOVED with the
// names a roster stopped reporting to ask what it deleted
// (internal/revision/acceptance.go). Where the two readers spell one check two
// ways it is counted twice in both unions — the same test arriving as
// `test_headers` and as `tests/api_test.py::test_headers` tells the gate a
// behaviour is covered twice, and names one deletion as two.
//
// The identity is THE BARE NAME, because it is the only spelling BOTH readers
// can reach. A declaration reader sees a `def`, a `func`, a `void` or an
// `it(...)`; it never sees the import path, the class, the node-id path, the
// describe() nesting or the subtest suffix a runner prints around it, and no
// amount of reading source recovers them. So every qualification a runner adds
// is stripped here, in this one function, and nowhere else.
//
// THIS IS THE READING OF A NAME A RUNNER PRINTED. A name read out of SOURCE
// goes through declaredIdentity, which is this reading with the nesting chain
// left alone, because a quoted description IS the leaf and the ` > ` inside
// `it("renders a > b")` is two words of it. The two are one function under two
// names, and the difference is the one thing a reader can know that this
// function cannot: where the name came from.
//
// WHAT IS NOT DONE HERE, deliberately: a roster keeps the runner's own
// qualified spelling. A name is two things — an identity and a LOCATION — and
// SplitReplaced reads the location out of it to tell a check that was rewritten
// under its own describe path from one that was deleted, which is a distinction
// that cost happy-dom's s13 run four repair rounds. Reducing every roster to
// bare names would take that reading away. So the identity is derived where two
// readers meet (UniqueChecks) rather than imposed on the readers themselves.
func CheckIdentity(name string) string { return identity(name, true) }

// declaredIdentity is that same reading of a name taken out of SOURCE.
//
// One difference, and it is the whole reason this name exists: the nesting
// chain is not split off. A runner builds `spec > renders a > b` out of the
// headings a check sits under; an author writes `renders a > b` and means every
// word of it. Splitting a declaration on its own ` > ` named the check `b`, in
// the roster the gate maps behaviours against and in the sentence that says a
// check was deleted.
//
// THE AMBIGUITY THIS LEAVES, stated rather than hidden: a title that itself
// contains ` > ` cannot be told from a chain once it has been printed, so the
// runner's reading of that check is its last segment and the union in
// UniqueChecks — which re-reads stored names and cannot know where they came
// from — reads every name the printed way. That is the safe direction of the
// ambiguity: the declaration and the banner reduce to the SAME last segment, so
// one check read both ways still unions as one check.
