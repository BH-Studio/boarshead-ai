// The tree read as a VOCABULARY: which of its public names a sentence names.
//
// The surface reader beside this answers "what does this tree declare". This
// answers the question a request asks of that answer — a person writing *the
// vertical scrollbar position* has named `ScrollBar.position`, in their own
// words, and nothing in this program could see it. textual s16 asserted
// `scroll_y` and `max_scroll_y` a hundred and six times, never once touched the
// scrollbar widget's own `position`, and the two hidden checks that failed
// assert exactly that (`assert 0 == 4 where 0 = ScrollBar(...position=0).position`).
//
// The match is by TOKEN SEQUENCE and nothing else. A name is broken into the
// words it is built out of — dots, underscores, dashes and interior capitals are
// all word boundaries — and it is spoken by a sentence where consecutive words
// of the sentence spell exactly those words, in order. `ScrollBar.position` is
// spoken by "scrollbar position"; it is not spoken by "position", because a
// single word is a word and not a name, and promoting every common word in a
// request to a name of the tree is how a floor becomes a wall.
