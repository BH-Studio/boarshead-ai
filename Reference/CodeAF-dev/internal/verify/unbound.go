// The fourth reading of the same tree: the names this run's own sources READ
// that nothing anywhere in the tree binds.
//
// The three readings beside this one all answer a question about a name that
// used to exist. The check-level reading says what a suite exercises; the
// presence photograph says which public names went; the changed-definition
// reading says which stayed while their shape moved. None of them can see a
// name that was NEVER there — an attribute a class reads and no code assigns, a
// binding an import asks a module for and the module does not define. That is a
// run referring to something it imagined, and the tree says so with no model,
// no toolchain and no type checker: the reference is in one file and the
// definition is in none.
//
// igel s14 is the measured shape. The run rewrote `igel/configs.py` so that
// `temp_post_req_data_path` became a local inside `_get_configs`, and
// `igel/servers/fastapi_server.py` still opens with
// `from igel.configs import temp_post_req_data_path`. All twenty-four hidden
// tests failed on `ImportError: cannot import name 'temp_post_req_data_path'`,
// and the only thing this harness could say about it was that the run's own
// checks were red — never WHICH name was unbound, which is the one word a
// repair round needs.
//
// IT IS DELIBERATELY NARROW SO THAT IT NEVER LIES. Python is a language where a
// name can be bound by a decorator, a metaclass, a `setattr` in a base class
// four files away, or a module's own `__getattr__`; TypeScript is a language
// with declaration merging and index signatures. Every one of those is a way for
// a reference this reader cannot see the binding for to be perfectly correct, so
// each of them SILENCES the scope it appears in rather than being reasoned
// about. What is left is the residue: a name read in one place and bound in no
// place, under a tree-wide index that counts a binding wherever in the
// repository it is spelled.
//
// Go and Rust are absent on purpose. `go build` and `cargo build` are the
// reading for those two, they are already run by the check-level half, and a
// second reader that guessed at the same question in fewer lines could only
// disagree with a compiler.
//
// FAILSAFE.md clause 1 for the reading — it is shape and never vocabulary — and
// clause 2 for where it comes from: the files on disk, and nothing the component
// being checked says about itself.
