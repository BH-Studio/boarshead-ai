package verify

// WHERE a reading is taken, as opposed to what is run and how it is read.
//
// discovery.go answers "what command checks this project" and runner.go answers
// "which program underneath it names the checks". Both of them assume there is
// ONE project at the root, and a monorepo is the case where that assumption is
// simply false. happy-dom's root `package.json` declares `turbo run test`, and
// turbo's whole job is to fan a task out over the packages the root says it is
// made of — so at a base commit whose workspace is uncompiled, the root command
// dies inside turbo having named no check of any package. The runner that names
// happy-dom's 7,260 checks is `vitest run`, and it is declared in
// `packages/happy-dom/package.json`, which the root reader never opened.
//
// The structural fact is that A WORKSPACE'S PACKAGES ARE DECLARED, and every
// ecosystem declares them in a file this program can read: npm and bun in
// `workspaces`, pnpm in pnpm-workspace.yaml, lerna in lerna.json, turbo by
// being a turbo repo at all, cargo in `[workspace] members`, Go in go.work, and
// Python by putting a pyproject.toml in each package. That is the same kind of
// declaration `declaredRunner` already reads, and it is read the same way: by
// what the repository says about itself, never by a list of project names.
//
// Which package to READ is then answered by the work itself. A job that changed
// files under packages/happy-dom is a job about happy-dom, and the package a
// path belongs to is the nearest directory at or above it that carries a
// manifest — the same nearest-declaration walk a package manager does. Nothing
// here knows what any benchmark contains.
