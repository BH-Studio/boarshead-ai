// The baseline is a property of the TREE AND THE JOB, never of the leaf.
//
// SETTLEMENT §4 built a photograph with a before half and an after half, and the
// bare worker took both. What it could not do is see across a repair round. Every
// round is a new leaf with a new workspace object, so every round photographed
// the tree IT found — which, from the second round on, is a tree the job has
// already changed. A check the first round turned red is red in the second
// round's baseline, so it subtracts to nothing and is never a finding again.
// textual's s5 run walked 17 of 20 project checks down to 1 across four rounds
// and raised no regression at any of them.
//
// The rule this file states: THE BASELINE IS THE TREE BEFORE THE JOB'S FIRST
// CHANGE, TAKEN ONCE AND INHERITED BY EVERY CONTINUATION. Every round's after
// reading is subtracted from that one, so a check broken in round one is still a
// finding in round four.
//
// It is remembered against the tree's own path because that is what the baseline
// is a reading of, and against the job because a second job in the same
// directory is measuring a different piece of work — the first job's changes are
// the second job's world, and blaming them on it would convict every job that
// followed another. A job that arrives at a root somebody else's job baselined
// re-baselines it, which is the same rule read from the other side.

// kept because this is compared, never read: two states are the same state or
// they are not. The empty string is the honest spelling of an UNTOUCHED tree,
// which is the state most errands are in for their whole life, and it is what a
// job that has produced nothing yields at every reader.
//
// A LIST OF NAMES IS NOT A STATE OF A TREE, and reading it as one is how this
// was first written. A repair round's whole job is usually to rewrite a file the
// round before it already recorded, so the record's NAMES are identical either
// side of the work while its BYTES are not — and a state built from names alone
// would call that tree unchanged and hand the gate a reading taken before the
// repair. So every recorded path is settled against the disk: its size and its
// modification time, which is the same before-and-after pair the workspace's own
// watch uses to decide a file moved (exec.Workspace.RecordChanges).
//
// AND A PATH THE TREE NO LONGER HOLDS IS THE LOUDEST CHANGE THERE IS. A deletion
// never reaches an artifact list — exec.Workspace.Artifacts holds what the tree
// still has, deliberately, because the list is also what a person is shown — so
// a caller that hands a deleted path in a continuation's record would otherwise
// get the same digest it got before the file went. It folds in as a marker,
// which is what makes the state answer the question its name asks.
//
// Sorted first, so two accounts of one tree that were assembled in different
// orders are one state. A path is taken as recorded and resolved against root
// when it is relative, because both sides of every comparison come from the same
// recorder and the recorders disagree about which spelling they keep.
