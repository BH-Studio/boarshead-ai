// A subharness is a named way of turning a Task into an Outcome. There is ONE
// worker, the generalist, and nothing chooses it because there is nothing to
// choose. What the rest of the system still needs from this file is the fact it
// has always needed before a leaf runs: how much room the leaf gets. The
// executor that does the work is registered separately, on a Registry, because
// a surface builds its worker with its own clients and workspaces while this
// description is a fact about the process.
//
// The manifest table below is the SAVED-PROGRAM contract (docs/SUBHARNESS-PRD.md):
// a bundle or a Go-native program registers its typed front door through
// [RegisterManifest]. A program is a named piece of work somebody saved, not a
// second worker, and nothing here puts a name in front of a model to pick.

// LinearSubharness is the worker. An empty name resolves to it, but the two are
// not the same fact: empty is a question nobody answered, and this name is the
// answer said out loud. GeneralistSubharness is the predicate that keeps them
// apart, and old graphs are full of both.

// SubharnessInfo is one registration: what it is for, and how much room its
// work is given.
//
// THE TAGS ARE THE ON-DISK SPELLING OF HALF A MANIFEST. [Manifest] embeds this
// struct and is the document a bundle's manifest.json actually is (PRD §6) — a
// file a person writes by hand, a model iterates on, and a pull request reviews.
// Untagged, this half of it would come out spelled in Go field names next to the
// tagged half's lowercase ones, and the format would be two conventions in one
// object. They are named the way the fields beside them are, and everything but
// the name is omitempty, so a manifest that says nothing about its budget shape
// carries nothing about it.

// across a change none of them could see. The reaper's window is derived from
// this figure two additions along, so a floor that moved here and nowhere else
