// ── THERE IS ONE WORKER ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A job is done by one worker. Nothing chooses it, because there is nothing to
// choose, and these two laws are what makes that sentence true of the whole
// tree rather than true of the file somebody last edited.
//
// The argument is not tidiness. A choice surface is a promise: a menu offered to
// a model is a model that will name something, a flag offered to a person is a
// person who will pin something, and a manual page that describes a second
// worker is a document about a program that does not run. Every one of those
// costs tokens on every call and every one of them ends at a name nothing can
// construct. So the choice goes wherever it is written down — in a prompt, in a
// schema, in a tool description, on a manual page, in a Go identifier, in the
// Makefile — and not only where it was convenient to delete.
//
//	(a) nothing a model or a person reads offers a worker to choose
//	(b) nothing in the tree names the workers that were removed
//
// Both read sources and hold them to the law, in this repo's convention (see
// internal/provider/funnel_law_test.go, internal/lane/structure_test.go). Each
// failure names a file and a line.

// repoRoot is the top of the checkout, found from this package's own directory
// rather than from a working directory a test runner chose.

// workerChoicePhrases are the shapes a worker choice takes in prose a model or

//
//   - a removed worker named as a thing that could take work;
//   - "specialist", which in this tree only ever meant "a worker other than the
//     one there is";
//   - the flag and the instruction that asked for a name back.
//
// Deliberately absent, and each for a reason: "linear" is also the sequential
// adjective and the screen-reader palette (`--linear`); "worker" is the ordinary
// word for the thing doing a task and is used everywhere it should be;
// "escalate" is the model ladder — a stronger model on the same worker — which
// is a live mechanism with its own glyph; and "subharness" on its own is the
// SAVED PROGRAM, a different feature entirely, which the manual is right to
// describe at length.
