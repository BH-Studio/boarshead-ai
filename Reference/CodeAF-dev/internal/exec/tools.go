//	job    keeps long-lived shell work from blocking the linear loop while
//	       preserving shell composition for logs and readiness monitors.
//	write  because content must not pass through a shell. Emitting a document
//	       through a heredoc means quoting prose, which corrupts it and burns
//	       tokens on escaping.
//	edit   because changing a paragraph should cost a paragraph, not a whole
//	       file re-typed.
//	web    the only capability a shell genuinely lacks. urls is plural because
//	       research is search-once-then-read-several, and batching that turns
//	       five round-trips into one.

// an absolute, which is the mistake the fill law exists to undo: a model holding
// a million tokens was handed the same twelve kilobytes as one holding thirty-two
// thousand. So the literals stay exactly as they are and change job. They are the
// numerator of a share of the window (see toolBudgetsFor), and they are the named
// fallback for the case where the window is unknown, which is what keeps offline
// behaviour byte-for-byte what it was.
//
// The ratios between them are the part that must not drift, and expressing all
// four against one reference window is what holds them: preview stays below
// spill, spill stays below the result cap, and recall stays the tightest of the
// three that bound a whole result.

// can grant it — a task that genuinely needs the running key (a script that
// calls the provider's API itself, say) gets it by exporting this before
// codeaf starts, not by asking the model to.

// directory codeaf owns, and every provider credential codeaf itself knows
// about removed unless [AllowProviderKeysInShell] says otherwise.
//
// A bash call the model runs inherits this process's environment, TMUX and
// TMUX_PANE included, so a bare `tmux` it runs targets the very server hosting
// the chat. That is how `tmux kill-server` once took down the chat that ran it
// (issue #576), and on a shared socket it reached every run on the box. A
// person running codeaf inside tmux has the same exposure.
//
// THE FLOOR IS BOTH HALVES, NOT EITHER. Unsetting TMUX/TMUX_PANE alone lets a
// bare `tmux` land on the user's default socket — the host server is safe, but
// the user's own tmux is still reachable, and a job that meant to reach its own
// server cannot. A private TMUX_TMPDIR alone leaves the inherited TMUX/TMUX_PANE
// pointing straight at the host server. Together they name a namespace a job's
// `tmux` reaches, and nothing outside it. A test that needs its own tmux still
// works: it gets that private TMUX_TMPDIR rather than a stripped-to-broken env.

// reads it without exporting it — so stripping the environment is the whole
// fix; there is nothing there to leave behind.
