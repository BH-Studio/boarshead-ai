// The accounting is a property of a RUN, and these tests are what keep it one.
//
// [Outcome.Account] was written for every worker that can observe its own change
// set, and then exactly one belt wrote it. That belt was removed in 05b99537 and
// the field went unassigned for a hundred commits: `grep -rn 'Account *='` over
// the whole tree answered nothing, every reader downstream went on politely
// reporting "no claim", and no test anywhere failed. A measurement wired into
// one loop leaves with that loop, quietly, and the only thing that can make the
// next removal loud is a test that reads the package's own shape rather than its
// behaviour.
//
// So the structural half below reads the package's own syntax and asserts four
// things about it: that PhotographAfter DEFERS AccountFor from its own body, that
// the seam is reached from the belt's own landing and from nowhere else, that
// nothing in this package creates an [Outcome] outside the single place
// linear.go does, and that only the belt and its landing hand one back.
//
// Each of those is spelled as narrowly as it is because every looser spelling
// was walked past by something ordinary: an identifier match passes for `if
// false { AccountFor(...) }`, a count of call sites passes for a forwarder, and
// a search for composite literals passes for `new(Outcome)` and for a named
// result never assigned. A tripwire that can be stepped over silently is the
// original defect wearing a different hat.
//
// The behavioural half then asserts what the account actually says, in a real
// git work tree with real files written into it — including the two answers it
// must refuse to give: a span or a patch where there is no repository, and a red
// suite acquitted against a baseline nobody read.

// after that carrying none.
//
// It asks for a DEFER STATEMENT IN THE FUNCTION'S OWN BODY and not merely for
// the name to appear somewhere inside it. Every weaker spelling of this test
// passes for a call that never runs — `if false { AccountFor(...) }` — for one
