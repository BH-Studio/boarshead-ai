// the filings and compare…") or a pointer to where the answer lives. Three of
// five runs of the same research journey against the same model produced the
// right figures with a citation; two produced the plan.

// The old contract forbade the *ending* — a summary of process, a claim that the
// work is done — and said nothing about the opening or the tense, so a message
// that had never done the work broke none of its rules. Both are stated now, and
// both are pinned here, because this paragraph is the single place the leaf is
// told what its last message is for.
