// was still working when it ran out of its tokens" against a grant of 150,000.
// Not one of them reached that grant. What landed every one of them was the
// cumulative bound on prompt sent, at 240,000, four landing turns before the
// number the record printed:
//
//	task-2 attempt 1   crossed 240,000 sent at turn 13, landed at 17
//	task-2 attempt 2   crossed 240,000 sent at turn 12, landed at 16
//	task-2-x1          crossed 240,000 sent at turn  9, landed at 13
//
