// bills the cached rate for the longest prefix that is byte-identical to the
// previous call and full price for everything after the first changed byte.
// Stubbing one old result rewrites a message near the front of the transcript,
// so the whole tail behind it — every assistant turn, every surviving result —
// is re-billed cold. In steady state the leaf adds N bytes of output per turn
// and must retire N bytes, so a trim-to-budget pass fires on *every* turn and
// the transcript is never cached past the fade line.
//
// Hysteresis converts that into one rewrite per K turns. On crossing the budget
// the pass retires in a single batch down to a low-water mark, leaving headroom
// behind it; the next several turns fit inside that headroom and touch nothing,
// so their prefixes are byte-identical and hit warm. One batch of stubs every K
// turns costs one invalidation where per-turn trimming costs K.
//
// The price is window size: on average the transcript carries less raw output
// than a trim-to-budget pass would leave. Nothing is lost either way — every
// stub still points at the spill file holding its bytes — so the whole question
// is what K comes out at, and that is where a fixed fraction went wrong. K is
// headroom divided by inflow, and the fraction only ever set the numerator. At
// the 25KB window this constant was tuned against, a quarter was 6.25KB of
// headroom against a measured 3.7KB of observation bytes per turn: K was 1.7,
// the batch bought less than two quiet turns, and hysteresis was paying its

//
// The rule was written as "assistant messages are compressed state", and that
// reasoning is sound about the RECENT ones and only about those. The model's
// last few turns are its live working memory — the plan it is executing, the
// conclusion it just reached, the draft that becomes the deliverable when the
// loop ends — and folding any of them would be deleting the thing the next turn
// is written against. Twenty turns back, the same message is a paragraph about a
// file that has since been rewritten, re-billed on every remaining turn: it is
// spent, exactly as a tool result is spent, and the measured evidence is that
// assistant output was 45% of context growth while the decayer could not reach
// a byte of it.
//
// Three keeps the current thought and the two it was built on. It is deliberately
// smaller than the eight-to-sixteen turns a well-sized leaf runs, because a fold
// that kept most of the run would reclaim nothing, and deliberately more than
// one, because a model that has just been told its own last message is a stub
// has been made to distrust its own memory.
//
// The deliverable is covered by this same keep and needs no separate rule: the
// leaf's contract is that the final message IS the deliverable (see
// systemPrompt), the fold runs at the top of a turn before that message exists,
// and lastAssistantText — what land() hands over when a leaf is stopped early —
// reads the newest assistant text there is, which is never foldable.

// A tool result is *spent raw material*: by the time three more turns have
// happened its value has usually already been extracted into the reasoning above
// it, and all it does is get re-billed on every remaining turn, so it retires
// first and it retires deep. An assistant message is *compressed state* — the
// model already read the raw output and wrote down what mattered — so it is
// worth many times its bytes and it is touched last, never while stubbing tool
// output would do, and never within foldKeepAssistantTurns of the live edge.
//
// What is not true, and was assumed for a long time, is that compressed state is
// worth its bytes forever. See fold.
//
// Newest results are kept in full until the budget runs out, then everything
// older collapses to a single line naming what it was and where its bytes
// went: before a result is stubbed, its full body is written to the
// workspace's observation directory, so the stub is a pointer rather than a
// tombstone — the agent can re-read the file with sh if it turns out to
// matter. Budgeting by bytes rather than by count means a turn full of small
// results all survive, while one huge one retires early — which is the right
// trade, because the huge one is what costs.
//
// Fading happens in batches, not continuously. See decayLowWaterPercent: a pass
// that fires clears down to the low-water mark so that most turns can leave the
// transcript untouched, because an untouched transcript is a cached one.

// fold retires aged assistant text, and only once retiring tool output has

//
// The order is the policy. decay runs first and reaches as deep as it likes into
// spent raw material; fold is asked afterwards, sees what that left, and does
// nothing at all unless the whole live body — results and reasoning together —
// is still over. So on the ordinary leaf, whose bulk is tool output, this pass
// measures and mutates nothing, and the "assistant messages are never touched"
// behaviour of every run before this one is exactly what still happens. It fires
// on the leaf whose own prose became the context: measured, assistant output was
// 45% of context growth, and no governor in the harness could see a byte of it.
//
// When it does fire it folds enough eligible messages in one batch to reach the
// same low-water target as observations. A soft pass is skipped when already-
// consumed reasoning cannot buy that full headroom: a rewrite anywhere in the
// transcript re-bills the entire tail cold, so a tiny correct rewrite can cost
// more than leaving the bytes alone. Everything newer than
// foldKeepAssistantTurns remains untouchable even at the safety line, which
// keeps the live edge and the deliverable intact.
//
// Nothing is lost. The full text goes to the same workspace spill the decay pass
// writes to, under the same write-once bookkeeping, and the stub left behind
// names that path — so a model that finds it needs its own earlier reasoning can
// read it back with sh, exactly as it can for a superseded result. A message
// whose bytes cannot be given a durable address is left alone rather than
// summarised away: a fold that cannot point is a deletion.
//
// Tool-call pairing is preserved absolutely. Only the text content of a message
// is replaced; its ToolCalls travel untouched, because an assistant tool_call
// with no answering tool message — or a tool message answering nothing — is a
// hard provider rejection rather than a degraded prompt.

// it, which is wrong the moment anything has changed underneath — so it had to
// be emptied whenever a turn ran sh, write or edit, and sh is also the read
// tool and appears in 87% of turns. Measured over 332 leaf turns it caught none
// of the 27 duplicate fetches that actually happened, while 12.5% of every
// observation byte the loop paid for was material it had already been shown.
//
// Keying on the bytes instead inverts both halves. The call still runs, so
// nothing is ever answered from a stale copy — the result is fetched fresh and
// only then compared — and mutation needs no invalidation rule at all, because
// bytes identical to bytes already in the transcript are identical whatever
// happened in between. What is saved is not the call, which was never the
// expensive part; it is the second and third copy of the same material riding
// every remaining turn of the leaf.
//
// A pointer is only ever emitted at something the model can still reach, and
// reachability is established before the pointer exists rather than checked as
// it is written.
//
// The difference matters because a pointer, once in the transcript, is never
// revisited — rewriting a message is exactly the cost this mechanism exists to
// avoid. Checking at write time is therefore a check about the present tense
// used to make a promise about the future: a target that is live when the
// pointer is written can decay three turns later, and if the spill that decay
// attempts happens to fail, the target becomes a pathless tombstone with
// pointers already aimed at it and no way left to reach the bytes.
//
// So the first time a body repeats, the canonical copy is written to the
// workspace before any pointer at it is emitted, and the decay pass reuses that
// exact path when it later stubs the message. If that write cannot be made, no
// pointer is emitted at all and the bytes are carried again — the saving is
// forfeited, which is the cheap failure. The expensive one is a model sent to
// read something that is not there.
//
// The cost is one file per body that actually repeats, written with the content
// already in hand, and never a file for a body that only ever appears once.
