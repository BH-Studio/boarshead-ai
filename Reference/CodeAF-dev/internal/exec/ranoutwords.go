// RanOutSubject names WHAT A LEAF RAN OUT OF, in the words a person would use
// rather than in the loop's own one-word ending.
//
// It lives beside [StopReason.OutOfRoom] and for the same reason: the answer
// travels. The record and the headless stream say it at the moment the leaf
// stops (cmd/codeaf's exhaustionWords), and the scheduler says it again on the
// other side of the seam when it hands the node back to the queue
// (resident.outOfRoomClaimReason) — and for as long as each of them kept its own
// table, one sentence could name the bound that fired while the other named only
// the meter that measured it, about the same leaf, three lines apart.
//
// An ending nobody recorded, and any ending that is not a leaf running out, gets
// the neutral phrase: a reason a reader cannot name is worse than a general one,
// and this is only ever composed for a leaf that was still working.
