// The leaf's own account of the change it made, taken for EVERY belt rather
// than for one of them.
//
// This is photograph.go's history repeating, one field over. [Account] was
// written to end a measured, expensive silence — a worker that could only hand
// back a sentence and a bill, and three readers downstream forced to act on the
// void when that sentence said nothing — and then the only thing in the tree
// that ever WROTE one lived beside a single belt. That belt was removed in
// 05b99537, and with it went the only assignment to Outcome.Account anywhere.
// Nothing noticed for a hundred commits, because every reader of an account is
// written to treat nil as "no claim": the plan's state view recorded an empty
// clause, the delivery gate weighed evidence with no change set and no diff in
// it, the composer's Landed() && Verified() answered no for every run in the
// world, and the bank was handed nothing to report. Each of them was quietly,
// correctly reporting that nobody had looked, forever.
//
// So the accounting is taken at THE ONE SEAM EVERY BELT LANDS THROUGH, which is
// PhotographAfter, and it is taken from sources every belt already has: the
// workspace's own before-and-after read of the tree, the repository underneath
// it, and the photograph's own second reading. It needs no subharness, no
// process boundary and no narration on a wire — a leaf that wrote one file with
// a shell command now accounts for it exactly as a pipeline behind a socket did.
//
// Everything here is a MEASUREMENT and never a gate, on photograph.go's own
// rule. It never fails a leaf, it never changes what a loop does, and every way
// it can go wrong — no git, no repository, a command that will not start, a
// scratch directory that cannot be written — leaves the outcome exactly as it
// would have been, holding a smaller claim rather than a false one.
//
// Two of those words are load-bearing and were only aspirations when this file
// was first written, which is worth saying plainly because a law stated in a
// comment and not met in the code is worse than no law at all.
//
// IT CANNOT BLOCK PAST THE LEAF. It runs from a defer on the leaf's own landing,
// so a git that hangs holds the whole run open. Every command is started on the
// leaf's context and every diff is run with `--no-ext-diff`: a repository can
// configure an external diff driver, per-repository or per-path, and a helper
// this program never named is not a helper cancelling a context reliably reaps.
//
// AND IT CANNOT PANIC. A nil context reaches os/exec as a crash, from a
// measurement whose whole contract is that it cannot change the outcome, so it
// is checked rather than assumed — every caller here is a defer, and a defer is
// exactly where a caller's mistake becomes this file's crash.

//
// It is called from exactly one place — the end of [PhotographAfter]'s body,
// through a defer, so that it runs on every one of that function's exits and no
// belt has to remember it. That is the whole structural point of the repair and
// account_writer_test.go is what keeps it true: a measurement wired into one
// belt is a measurement that leaves with that belt.
//
// base is where the repository's history stood when the tree was photographed,
