// The literals are still written down — they are what an unrecognised model
// gets, and keeping them is what makes an offline run byte-for-byte what it
// always was — but they are no longer what a recognised model gets. That was
// the first defect: a leaf on a model holding a million tokens was handed the
// same twelve kilobytes of result as a leaf holding thirty-two thousand,
// because the numbers had been measured once against the small case and then
// written as absolutes.
//
// The law this test used to state was the correction to that, and it overshot:
// "a 1M model gets more than a 200k model" made the share a function of the
// window, while the memory the result has to live in was already a function of
// min(window, working set). The measured consequence is in toolBudgetsFor — one
// sh result permitted 7.5x the whole observation window that must carry it, so
// two results overflowed on arrival and the decay pass fired every turn. The
// honest law is the one below: the bounds converge on the NAMED WORKING SET,
// they are not a belief about a window, and the operator who raises the working
// set raises them with it.
