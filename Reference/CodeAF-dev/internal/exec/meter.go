// The per-turn meter.
//
// One summed row per node was the whole of the accounting, and it cannot answer
// the question every governor, judge and benchmark actually has. A node row says
// a leaf spent 265,000 prompt tokens; it does not say whether that was two turns
// carrying 130k each or twenty-four carrying eleven, and those are opposite
// findings — the first is a node given too much material, the second is a node
// going round in circles re-sending the same material at full price. Measured on
// a real run the journal held 25 rows for 111 model calls, and half of the
// surprise metric the planner recalibrates from is turns.
//
// So the shape is journaled beside the total: what each turn sent, what it got
// back, what the provider served warm. Nothing is derived from it here — it is
// evidence, and its whole job is to be summable back to exactly the row that was
// already being written.

// TurnUsage is one turn of one leaf: the model call it made, plus whatever its
// tools spent on its behalf while it ran.
//
// Tool spend is folded into the turn that caused it rather than kept aside,
// because the invariant that makes this ledger trustworthy is that the rows sum
// to the node row — a reader who has to remember which costs were left out has
// been handed a second, quieter accounting rather than a finer one.

	// turns it is the leaf's cumulative context pressure — the quantity a
	// per-turn window bound cannot see because no single turn is large, and a
	// cache-discounted spend meter cannot see because most of it was cheap.

// yet — still reaches the node total, because a bill nobody can place is still a

//
// THE MEASUREMENT THAT RETIRED IT, from ink s9 of 2026-08-29 (three leaves, one
// store). Every one of the three was landed here and not by its grant, at
// exactly this ceiling plus the four landing turns:
//
//	task-2 attempt 1   crossed 240,000 sent at turn 13, landed at 17
//	task-2 attempt 2   crossed 240,000 sent at turn 12, landed at 16
//	task-2-x1          crossed 240,000 sent at turn  9, landed at 13
//
// The first of those had spent 104,064 of its 150,000-token grant and 372,941
// of its 450,000 raw ceiling — it was cut at turn 13 of a 200-turn grant having
// used 69% of the money. And the journal said "it was still working when it ran
// out of its tokens", naming 150,000, a number no attempt came near.
//
// Two structural reasons, either of which is fatal on its own:
//
//   - IT IS TURNS × MEAN-CONTEXT WEARING A TOKEN NAME. A transcript that only
//     grows re-sends its whole prefix every turn, so Σ sent ≈ N²·s/2 for ANY
//     loop. The duplication factor it implies is ≈ N/2 whatever the leaf is
//     doing: ink s9 stopped at 8.9× and the audited runaway this bound was
//     built for ran 11.2×. No detector lives in a separation of 1.26×.
//   - IT IS STATED AGAINST THE WINDOW AND CONSUMED AGAINST THE TRANSCRIPT, so
//     it rewards carrying MORE. A leaf holding 30k of a 96k fill is landed at a
//     third of the turns a leaf holding 96k gets, for the same work.
//
// The runaway it was written for — a warm loop re-reading files it has already
// read — is the no-progress guard's case, and noprogress.go opens by saying in
// terms that a magnitude bound cannot separate "many turns because the work is
// hard" from "many turns because it is stuck", and that a signal which can was
// what was missing. That signal exists now. This one is kept as evidence and as
// pressure on the wrap-up warning (budgetUsed), where firing early costs a
// sentence instead of a leaf's work.
//
// What follows is the reasoning it was introduced with, kept because the
// quantity it names is real even though bounding it was not the answer.
//
// The other two are both grants. spent() bounds what a leaf COSTS and weights
// cache reads at a tenth, which is honest about the bill and blind to runaway;
// rawSpent() bounds the same grant undiscounted, which is a multiple of a number
// set per task and therefore says nothing about the model doing the work. What
// neither can see is the shape underneath: Σ over turns of in_k, the quantity
// that climbs when nothing ever leaves a transcript. Measured, that sum carried
// a duplication factor of 7.45x — 90% of every input token a re-send — while a
// 265k-token node metered at 54% of its grant and 58% of its raw ceiling and
// stopped itself, unassisted, at turn 17.
//
// The bound is stated in ctxbudget, against the working set the transcript is
// allowed to fill, so it scales with the model instead of with the task's
// wallet. Zero means the window was never known — see ctxbudget.Known — and an
// unknown window is not governed: a bound derived from a guess would land honest
// leaves on evidence nobody has.
