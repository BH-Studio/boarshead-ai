// This glue used to live beside one belt, where only that belt could reach it.
// That made the measurement a property of one loop instead of a property of a
// run: the leaf belt in linear.go — the belt every node gets — took no reading
// at all, and a graded run on it left a store with no verification event in it.
// The three leaves of ink-grid-box-layout's s9 run journaled not one row.
//
// That silence is FAILSAFE.md's sixth failure exactly. AN ABSENCE IN THE RECORD
// IS NEVER A DIAGNOSIS; it is the four diagnoses nobody can tell apart — a
// project that declares no verification, a wall too short to afford a reading, a
// shell the preamble cannot be trusted in, and a command killed at its ceiling.
// Three of those cost a run nothing and the fourth costs an eighth of its wall,
// and the finished store spelled all four the same way.
//
// Everything here is a MEASUREMENT and never a gate. It never fails the leaf, it
// never changes what a loop does, and every way it can go wrong leaves the
// outcome exactly as it would have been. An error is journaled or dropped; none
// is ever returned.

// whole [Opening] — the reading, whether the job has moved the tree since it was
// taken, and where the repository's history stood — because all three are
// carried to the same seam.
//
// A repair round is a new leaf, in a new workspace object, standing in a tree
// its own job has already changed. A leaf that photographed what IT found took
// the broken tree as its baseline, so every check an earlier round turned red
// subtracted to nothing and was never a finding again — textual's s5 run walked
// twenty project checks down to one across four rounds and raised nothing. So
// the baseline is looked up first: where this job already settled what its tree
// looked like — a reading, or the reason there could not be one — this leaf
// inherits that answer and spends nothing on reaching it again.
//
// A first reading of a tree runs BEFORE Workspace.WatchTree deliberately. A test
// runner leaves its own droppings — a .pytest_cache, a target/, a coverage
// file — and a reading taken after the tree was photographed would file every
// one of them as something this leaf produced. Taken first, they are part of the
// world the leaf arrived in, which is what they are. Every belt that calls this
// owes it that ordering.
//
// EVERY OUTCOME IS JOURNALED, including every way of having no reading. That is
// the whole repair of the s6 silence: a leaf spent five minutes and twenty-seven
// seconds on a reading that was killed at its ceiling, and the finished store
// held no row saying so, which read from outside exactly like a project that
// declares no verification at all.
//
// The worker's own wall is passed in rather than read off a belt, because the
// three belts hold it under three different names and a shared measurement must
// not have to know which one it is standing in. A nil history is ordinary — a
// leaf run outside a graph has no journal to write into — and the reading is
// taken and weighed identically with or without one.
//
// The opening's own Moved is the other half of the answer, and it is what the
// second reading is bought with: THE JOB HAS CHANGED FILES SINCE THIS READING
// WAS TAKEN. It used
// to say "this leaf inherited a reading", which is a fact about a lookup and not
// about a tree — every leaf after the first inherits — so a job whose leaves
// were ordered to change nothing bought a whole second reading at every one of
// them. The measured errand spent four of them, two minutes each, on a tree that
