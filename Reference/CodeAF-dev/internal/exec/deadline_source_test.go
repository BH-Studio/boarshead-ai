// A LEAF'S ROOM IS SIZED IN ONE PLACE, AND THIS IS THE TEST OF IT.
//
// The same two figures — a fifteen-minute floor and a minute for every fifty
// thousand tokens above it — were written out longhand in five files, and the
// two minutes the node watchdog sits above the result in seven. None of the
// copies was wrong; what was wrong is that they had to be kept in step by hand
// across a change none of them could see. The claim reaper's window is this
// floor plus that pad plus five minutes, so a floor raised in the chat surface
// and nowhere else put the backstop BELOW the deadline it exists to sit above,
// which is not a backstop but the thing that fires first. That is the shape of
// the seventh failure in docs/design/failsafe/FAILSAFE.md, and it cost two
// benchmark runs their whole ninety-minute wall.
//
// So there is one author: [SubharnessInfo.Deadline] for the room, and
// [WatchdogAbove] for the pad over it. Every other file asks. A fifth copy of
// the arithmetic, or an eighth hand-written pad, fails the build here.
//
// THE LAW READS THE ACT, NOT THE SPELLING. What it looks for is the write that
// hands a leaf its room — an assignment or a struct field whose target is
// called a deadline or a watchdog, sized from a literal or from arithmetic
// instead of from the table. So `deadline := 900 * time.Second` fails exactly
// as `15 * time.Minute` does, and `defaultDoWall = 15 * time.Minute` in
// cmd/codeaf passes, because a run's wall is not a leaf's room and no amount of
// respelling either figure changes which of the two it is. Matching the digits
// rather than the act got both of those backwards once, and #379 was reverted
// for the wrong one.
//
// The reflex rung is the one leaf whose room is not in the table yet, and it is
// excused by name in both directions below; moving it into the table retires
// both exceptions.
//
// The three trees are the ones a leaf's room is decided in: this package
// registers the shapes, internal/resident's reaper is measured from them, and
// cmd/codeaf is every surface that dispatches a leaf.
