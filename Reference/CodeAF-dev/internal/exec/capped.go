// kilobytes away. `go test ./...` on a large tree, a verbose build, a `find /`
// that went wrong — each is hundreds of megabytes, held twice while the string
// conversion is made, inside a call that is allowed to run for fifteen minutes,
// once per concurrent leaf. Nothing downstream ever sees those bytes.
//
// So this keeps exactly what the result bound keeps — a ring holding the tail,
// the counts a truncation notice has to state, and a file on the side holding
// everything — and renders what boundResult would have rendered from the whole.
// Memory is bounded at the carry limit no matter how much the command prints.
//
// The tail is what is kept because this is COMMAND output, and a command's most
// valuable line is its last: the compiler's error, the test summary, the
// traceback, the exit reason. The head is not lost, it is moved — the moment
// the output outgrows what can be carried, the collector opens the spill file
// and everything goes there, so the notice can hand the model the exact command
// that reads back the part that was cut.
