// What a command left behind, and why the write tools alone could never see it.
//
// The artifact registry used to be populated by the write family only — write,
// edit, and the media tools — which encodes the assumption that a file arrives
// in the workspace by being typed into a tool call. Most of the useful ones do
// not. A script run under `sh` renders a chart, a build writes a binary, a
// converter emits a document: the leaf did the work, the file is on disk, and
// nothing in the product ever learned it existed. One measured run saved a
// 204KB plot the person had asked to see, never named it, was failed by the
// delivery gate for a message that "did not contain the script", and spent a
// whole continuation node retyping a file already sitting in the workspace.
//
// The first repair asked the CLOCK: note the instant the call began, walk the
// tree once afterwards, keep whatever carried a later write time. That is
// evidence sourced from the component being checked rather than from the world,
// which is the exact shape FAILSAFE.md rule 2 was written about, and it was
// wrong in three ordinary cases:
//
//   - a file written inside the filesystem's own timestamp granularity of the
//     mark carries a stamp fractionally BEFORE it and was silently dropped —
//     TestABareLeafFilesTheFilesItsToolsLeaveBehind failed about one run in four
//     on a machine whose tmpfs answers in whole milliseconds;
//   - a file a tool put there with its timestamp preserved (cp -p, git checkout,
//     tar, rsync -t) claims to predate a mark it postdates, and the deliverable
//     is never named;
//   - a file rewritten with identical bytes moved the clock and nothing else,
//     and was named as though the call had produced something.
//
// So the sweep now asks the WORLD, in the same words the whole-leaf evidence
// record asks it: [Workspace.Snapshot] photographs the tree before the call and
// again after it, and [diffTrees] — ONE implementation, shared with
// [Workspace.WatchTree] and [Workspace.RecordChanges] — says what the two
// sightings prove. Files created, changed or deleted between them are this
// call's products whatever any clock says, and the files it finds go into the
// same registry the write tools use, under the same node identity, so
// everything downstream — the files footer, the gate's evidence, a
// continuation's inputs — is fixed by this one record.
//
// The cost of asking the world is a second bounded walk per tool call rather
// than one; see [Workspace.Snapshot] for the bounds and PERF.md for the budget.

	// producedScanLimit bounds one snapshot. A workspace is usually a handful of

	// its bytes. Above it the stamp keeps size, mode and write time, which is
	// the answer the sweep gave before digests existed. A deliverable bigger
	// than a megabyte is nearly always bigger than its predecessor too, so the
	// size alone still catches it; what is given up is the rewrite-in-place of
	// a large file at exactly its old length, which the tool-sourced record
	// covers and which is why the two accounts are layered rather than one
	// chosen over the other.

	// the remaining stamps are digestless and fall back on the clock. It bounds

	// files just under the per-file limit would be six gigabytes of reading on
	// the leaf's critical path, twice per tool call.
	//
	// Eight megabytes is chosen against the real workspace — a report, a chart,
	// a script — and against the cost of being wrong about it. WHAT DEGRADES
	// PAST THE BUDGET IS ONLY THE REWRITE CASE: created and deleted files are
	// decided by whether the tree holds the path at all, which needs no bytes
	// and is the half that was actually broken. A tree big enough to exhaust
	// this gets the older, narrower size-and-clock answer for its tail, never a
	// wrong one. The walk is lexical, so both snapshots spend the budget on the
	// same files and compare like with like.
