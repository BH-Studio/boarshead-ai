// THE LEAF'S GRANT IS ONE NUMBER AND NOBODY SPELLS IT TWICE.
//
// [DefaultLeafTokens] is calibrated against measured work, and recalibrating it
// is a reading somebody takes and writes down. That reading is worthless if a
// second copy of the figure sits at a door: `codeaf exec`, `codeaf run` and the
// chat surface each carried their own `150000`, and chat's even carried a
// comment promising it "mirrors the headless run defaults exactly" — which is
// an intention where this repository's one-source-of-truth law wants an
// interpolation. Four numbers had to be moved together, by somebody who knew
// all four were there, and the help text at a door could tell a person a figure
// the loop had stopped using.
//
// IT READS EVERY INTEGER LITERAL AND NOT ONLY DECLARED ONES. Its first draft
// inspected `*ast.ValueSpec`, which would have caught exactly ONE of the four
// copies in the story above: the other three were call arguments —
// `newCountFlag(flags, "token-budget", 150000, …)` and `flags.Int("token-budget",
// 150000, …)` — and a flag default is the most likely place for this figure to
// be written a second time, because that is where a door states what it does
// when nobody says otherwise. A law that misses the shape it was written for is
// decoration.
//
// WHERE IT LOOKS, AND WHY NOT EVERYWHERE. A door that states a default is the
// shape this law is about: `--token-budget`'s default, the chat surface's own
// constant, a test that asserts what a door does when nobody says otherwise.
// Inside the package that OWNS the constant, an integer equal to it is usually
// a fixture — `NewLinear(client, space, nil, 50, 150_000, time.Minute)` is a
// test choosing a size, not a second opinion about the default — and there are
// thirteen of them. Policing those would force every fixture to move with a
// recalibration and would say nothing true about drift. So: every file under
// the surfaces, and only the non-test files of internal/exec.
//
// WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, SAID PLAINLY RATHER THAN GUESSED AT. It watches the
// CURRENT figure, so a copy left behind by a recalibration — a door still
// saying what the loop used to do — is invisible to it until somebody sweeps
// for the old number by hand, and a recalibration owes that sweep. Watching the
// past figures instead was tried and withdrawn: 400,000 was a grant once and is
// also an ordinary round number, and the law then failed an unrelated spend
// receipt and an unrelated context length for spelling it. A law that cries
// wolf is worse than one with a stated blind spot. It is also blind to a figure
// written in hex or in some other underscore grouping, and to the manual's own
// prose, which is markdown and out of an AST law's reach — internal/manual's
// TestEveryFigureAChatPageQuotesComesFromTheCodeThatOwnsIt already owns that
// half, checking the sentence adaptive-runs.md writes the grant into against
// `codeaf exec --token-budget`'s default. A second law for the same claim was
// written here and deleted: two gates on one figure is the drift this file
// exists to stop, wearing a test's clothes.
