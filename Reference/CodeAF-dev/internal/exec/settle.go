// Settle writes one leaf's measured ending onto its plan node and hands the
// document that ending changed to the journal.
//
// It is one function because both doors owe the same nine fields and the same
// state rule, while only the chat door has a durable namespace to journal. A
// new door reaches this seam rather than growing a partial copy of the ending.
// For the headless door this also carries Calibration into the profile record
// cmd/codeaf/run.go builds, where the worker's account of its own fit was
// previously absent.
//
// The journal is called with the ending settled and before a door's own last
// word about the node, which costs nothing that can be lost: a rehydrated plan
// re-derives State, Result and Failure from the durable rows
// (cmd/codeaf/chat.go, syncPlanState), and the fields only the journal can
// carry are exactly the ones written here. journal is nil where a surface has
// nowhere durable to write.
