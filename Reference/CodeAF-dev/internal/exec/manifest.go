// THE MANIFEST: everything about a subharness that is true before it runs.
//
// docs/SUBHARNESS-PRD.md §3 asks for one language-agnostic description shared by
// the subharnesses compiled into this binary and the ones a person writes as a
// JavaScript bundle, and it asks for it as a GROWTH of [SubharnessInfo] rather
// than as a second type beside it. That is what the embedding below is. Every
// reader that has ever asked a registration for its name, its purpose, its ruler
// or its budget shape still asks the same fields of the same struct; a manifest
// is that struct plus the six things a TYPED program needs and a leaf worker
// never did — the schemas, the whitelist, the cues, the guards, and where it
// came from.
//
// ONE NAMESPACE ACROSS GO AND JS, which is the decision the whole contract rests
// on. There is exactly one map from a name to a subharness in this process, so a
// bundle on disk and a worker compiled in are the same kind of thing to the
// person, to the model, and to every list either of them reads. Which language
// ran it is a fact about the runner and reaches no surface.
type Manifest struct {
	// SubharnessInfo is the identity and the COST SHAPE, unchanged and in the
	// same spelling every existing caller reads: the name, the one line of
	// purpose, the capacity ruler the sizing pass quotes, and the three fields
	// [SubharnessInfo.Deadline] turns into a leaf's hang backstop. The PRD names
	// this pair — prior anchors plus deadline shape — as the manifest's cost
	// shape and says to keep the linearInfo form. Embedding is how it is kept:
	// there is no second spelling of a budget anywhere in this file.
	SubharnessInfo

	// Cues are the trigger vocabulary a match is made against — the words that
	// mean this work, written down at design time and PERSISTED with the
	// program. Their absence from disk is a real hole in the old system, named
	// at internal/session/harness_build.go where a designed harness's cues die
	// with the session that designed them and the page it saved carries none.
	// A manifest with no cues is found by being NAMED and by nothing else, which
	// is a quieter subharness rather than a broken one.
	Cues []string `json:"cues,omitempty"`

	// Input is the typed front door: a JSON Schema with defaults and optional
	// fields, which the intake card draws field by field and chat fills from the
	// conversation. A Go runner may derive it by reflection over a struct; a
	// bundle declares it. Both arrive here as the same bytes.
	Input Schema `json:"input,omitempty"`

	// Output is the PROMISE, and it is the machine-checkable finish line the old
	// one-string program form never had. A run that ends without producing this
	// shape is INCOMPLETE — never done with a strange message — and that
	// sentence is enforceable only because the shape is written down here.
	Output Schema `json:"output,omitempty"`

	// Whitelist is the belt tools this subharness may call through [Env.Tool].
	// It is a ceiling and not a grant: a tool named here that the session does
	// not have is simply not there, and every call still goes through the same
	// consent doors an ordinary tool call goes through. An empty whitelist is a
	// subharness that spends only on the model.
	Whitelist []string `json:"whitelist,omitempty"`

	// Guards are the cheap preconditions checked before a run — a file that has
	// to exist, a tool that has to be on the belt, an input field that has to
	// look a certain way. A FAILED GUARD IS NOT A FAILED RUN: the run falls back
	// to the general worker with the same input, and the person is told the step
	// needed a closer look. See [Guard] for the vocabulary law that governs what
	// they are allowed to say.
	Guards []Guard `json:"guards,omitempty"`

	// Provenance is where this subharness was found: shipped in the binary,
	// written by the person, or committed into the repository they are standing
	// in. It is drawn as a dim mark on the list and it is the one field a person
	// reads that this file spells in words rather than in a code.
	//
	// PROVENANCE IS STAMPED, NEVER AUTHORED. A manifest.json on disk does not get
	// to claim it is built in; the registry writes this field from the layer the
	// bundle was actually loaded out of ([Layer.Provenance]), which is why
	// [Manifest.Validate] neither requires it nor objects to it.
	Provenance Provenance `json:"provenance,omitempty"`
}

// Provenance is where a subharness came from, in the three words a person reads.

	//
	// ONE CATALOG, SEVERAL PLACES A PROGRAM CAN LIVE. A page is not a second kind
	// of subharness and nothing downstream of this constant may treat it as one:

	// ([Layer.Provenance] answers `yours` for it as it does for the home store),
	// and every list draws it beside the bundles and the compiled-in workers
	// without a word about which is which.
	//
	// It is LAST because a page declares no schemas of its own, so a name carried
	// by both stores is better served by the bundle: the lookup order is the whole
	// of that decision and it lives here.
