// leaf's own voice. Different words are allowed and a different rule is not:
// the contract written for the deliverable owner demanded the whole thing in
// the final message and never filed, while this prompt demanded under about
// three hundred words with the long version filed, and a run died over four
// gate rounds in the gap between them.
//
// What reconciles them is the split, not a length — the answer is never what
// gets filed, and the working always may be — so the split is the clause both
// documents have to state.

// 288-line script could satisfy neither, stalled three times trying, and
// delivered a transcription while the output it had rendered went unmentioned.
//
// So both texts now say that where the work produced the thing, the produced
// thing is the answer — named, with its substance summarised — and that the
// demand for full text is what applies when nothing was produced that carries
// it. Whether a run produced anything is a fact about that run, so it is stated
// as something the worker judges rather than switched on from outside: the leaf
// system message is a shared prompt prefix and its bytes may not vary per run.
