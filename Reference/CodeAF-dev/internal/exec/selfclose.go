// A leaf closes its own photograph finding before it lands.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS ANSWERS. PhotographAfter is a measurement of the finished
// leaf, and everything it finds — a public name the work deleted, a name the
// work reads that nothing binds, the work's own checks red, a check the work
// turned red — used to reach nobody until three things had happened: the leaf
// landed, a gate weighed it, and the growth governor bought a repair round. That
// round is a COLD SPLICE. It is a new leaf, with a fresh brief, in a new
// context, holding none of the reasoning that produced the fault it is sent to
// fix — and igel's v4-flash s14 run is the whole argument. Its original leaf
// photographed clean twice (`surface task-2 lost=0`). Then a growth round bought
// `task-2-x1-n4`, which lost three public names off `igel/configs.py`
// — init_file_path, res_path, temp_post_req_data_path — and every cold leaf
// after it deleted what the last one had relied on. All twenty-four hidden tests
// failed on `cannot import name 'temp_post_req_data_path'`, a name that was
// readable off the tree the moment the leaf that removed it stopped.
//
// The leaf that caused the fault is the cheapest and best-informed reader of it,
// and at the moment the photograph is taken it is STILL STANDING: it holds its
// own transcript, its own reasoning, its own prefix cache, and the room it did
// not spend. So it is asked, once, before anything is bought.
//
//	A FINDING A LEAF RAISED AGAINST ITSELF IS PUT TO THAT LEAF BEFORE IT IS
//	PUT TO A GATE. The leaf is not landed; it is resumed on the transcript it
//	already has, with the finding as the note, inside what is left of its own
//	meter — the same shape a leaf that ran out of room is resumed in, and never
//	a new bound of its own.
//
// EVERY BOUND HERE IS DERIVED AND NONE IS NEW. The room a close may spend is
// exactly what the leaf has left of the turns, the billed tokens and the wall it
// was already granted; a leaf whose meter is spent lands with its finding, as it
// does today. The number of closes is bounded by the finding KINDS the leaf can
// raise against itself, one each, because a second reading that is still red has
// said the only thing it is going to and the gate is the floor under it.
//
// It is asked at the one exit where a leaf finishes UNDER ITS OWN POWER. A leaf
// landed by its clock, its turns, its budget or a straggler hand-back has no
// room by construction, and a leaf that was cancelled, paused, faulted, promoted
// or split is not being asked to deliver anything.
