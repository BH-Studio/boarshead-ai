// A worker is alive because of what it is DOING, and the journal is the wrong
// place to ask.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS ANSWERS. The claim reaper decides a node is held by nobody
// from the marks a worker leaves in the store: a billed model call, a flushed
// batch of recorded turns. Both are written when something FINISHES, and the
// transcript's flush is batched at sixty-four entries on purpose — one write per
// tool result would put several hundred rows under a node and turn the database
// into a log file (see store/transcript.go). So a leaf that spends twenty
// minutes inside three long shell commands writes nothing at all in that time,
// and a reaper reading only the journal cannot tell it from a corpse.
//
// The fix is not a flush timer. A timer would be a second clock answering a
// question the first clock is already wrong about, and it would spend a durable
// write on every leaf in the system to rescue the rare one that is quiet. The
// fact that was missing is simply that A CALL IS IN FLIGHT — the worker asked
// the model, or started a command, and has not been answered yet — and that
// fact is known in this process, for free, by the code that is waiting.
//
// So a worker says so, through the context, exactly as it already says where its
// transcript goes (WithTranscript above). The scheduler that dispatched the leaf
// is the listener, because the reaper is in the same process as the worker it
// would be reaping; nobody listening is the ordinary case for a unit test or a
// bench harness and costs one type assertion.
//
// IT IS A SPAN AND NOT A PING. "A tool call was issued" would keep a claim alive
// for one instant and then go quiet again for the whole seven minutes the
// command actually runs, which is the case this exists for. What is reported is
// the beginning and the end, and everything between them is a worker that is
// demonstrably waiting on something.

// LivenessMark is told that a call is starting and returns the function that
// says it finished. An implementation must be safe for concurrent use: a batch
// of tools runs in parallel, so several spans are open at once.

// worker. They are different questions asked by different code at different
// levels, about the same fact, and the fact is reported once. A plain
