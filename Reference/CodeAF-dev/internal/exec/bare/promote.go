package bare

// PROMOTING A RUNNING FOREGROUND COMMAND, WITHOUT BARE LEARNING WHAT A JOB IS.
//
// A foreground bash call is committed at the moment it is made. When `make`
// turns out to take nine minutes, the timeout kills the process group and the
// caller starts again from nothing — the nine minutes are thrown away, and
// neither the model nor the person could have known in advance which side of
// the line the command fell on.
//
// The fix is a HANDOFF, and the seam it needs is drawn here, in the package that
// owns the exec.Cmd frame and the timeout, because those are the two things a
// handoff has to move. What it moves them TO is nobody's business here: this
// package has no registry, no notion of a session, and no opinion about what a
// promoted process should be called afterwards. It offers a running call and
// takes back one sentence.
//
// Three rules hold the whole thing up:
//
//   - ONE Wait PER PROCESS. Go's exec package permits exactly one call to
//     cmd.Wait, and bash's is already in flight when a promotion happens. So the
//     wait is not moved — its RESULT is. [BashCall.Exit] is fed by the same
//     goroutine that was always waiting, and whoever adopts the call reads the
//     exit code off it and settles the process however it settles processes.
//     The alternative — handing the *exec.Cmd over and letting the new owner
//     wait on it — is the one shape the standard library will not allow.
//
//   - THE ADOPTION IS ONE ATOMIC CLAIM. A call ends exactly once, and four
//     things race to end it: the process exiting, the timeout firing, the turn's
//     context being cancelled, and somebody adopting it. [BashCall.Adopt] runs
//     the adopter's own work INSIDE the claim, so there is no window between
//     "nothing else may end this call" and "this is the sentence it answers".
//
//   - INTERRUPT MEANS STOP. A call whose context is already cancelled may not be
//     adopted, at any price. A person who pressed esc asked for the work to end,
//     and promoting it into something that outlives the turn they just ended
//     would be the harness overruling them.
