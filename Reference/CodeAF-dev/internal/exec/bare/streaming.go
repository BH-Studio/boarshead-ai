// EVERY COMMAND IS A STREAM, AND ITS OUTPUT MUST EXIST BEFORE IT EXITS.
//
// This file is one small law with a long reason behind it.
//
// A program that writes to a PIPE rather than a terminal block-buffers its
// output: nothing leaves it until 4KB have piled up or the process exits. That
// is the C library's default and Python's, and it is invisible while commands
// are short. It stops being invisible the moment a command outlives the call
// that made it. A scoring script that takes four minutes and prints a line per
// case wrote NOTHING anybody could read until the last second of it — so the
// job's log sat at zero bytes, every look at it answered `(no output)`, and the
// model reading those answers concluded the work was dead and killed it. Nine
// times in one benchmark. The command was fine; the buffering made it look like
// a corpse.
//
// ── WHY NOT A PTY ──
//
// The textbook fix is to give the command a pseudo-terminal, which is what
// makes every runtime line-buffer at once. It was rejected, and the reason is
// that a tty is not a buffering switch — it is a declaration that a PERSON is
// watching, and programs act on it:
//
//   - `git log` starts a pager and waits forever for a keypress nobody will
//     press.
//   - `ls`, `grep` and half of cargo/npm emit ANSI colour, so every result the
//     model reads is full of escape bytes it has to see past.
//   - the terminal line discipline turns every `\n` into `\r\n`, which changes
//     the bytes of EVERY bash result in the program, golden tests included.
//
// Three regressions across every command, in exchange for a buffering fix that
// two narrower mechanisms deliver with no side effects at all. So this file uses
// those two instead, and neither of them can be observed by the command as
// anything other than "my output is line-buffered".
//
// ── THE TWO MECHANISMS ──
//
//   - `stdbuf -oL -eL` in front of the shell. It is coreutils' own answer, it
//     covers everything that buffers through the C library, and it is inherited
//     by children. It is used only where it is PROVEN to work: [stdbufPrefix]
//     runs it once against `true` and takes it only if that exits clean and
//     silent, because a static binary or a musl system answers a warning on
//     stderr that would then be pasted onto the front of every command's output.
//
//   - `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` in the environment. Python does its own buffering
//     above the C library, so `stdbuf` does not reach it — and Python is what
//     the measured defect was actually running. One environment variable, read
//     by every Python since 2.x, and it does nothing to any other program.
//
// A machine with neither is left exactly as it was: this is a capability that
// improves what it can reach and never fails, because a command whose output
// arrives late is still a command that ran.

// MaxResultLines and MaxResultBytes are the caps a belt that cannot say how

// StreamingEnv is the environment such a command runs in: the person's own,

//
// IT ALSO CARRIES THE TMUX FLOOR AND STRIPS PROVIDER KEYS. A command the model
// runs must not reach the tmux server hosting codeaf, and must not read back a
// provider credential codeaf itself holds, so the environment is passed
// through internal/exec's [exec.JobShellEnv], which strips TMUX, TMUX_PANE and
// every provider key codeaf knows about, and points TMUX_TMPDIR at a directory
// codeaf owns (see tools.go for why both tmux halves are the floor, and for the
// opt-in a task can use to keep a key). This is the bare path's one seam for a
// model's shell — the foreground bash tool and the session's job registry both
// reach it through here — so the strip lives here rather than at each caller.
//
// THE PERSON'S OWN SETTING WINS. Somebody who exported PYTHONUNBUFFERED

// that overwrote it would be making a decision about their program that they had
