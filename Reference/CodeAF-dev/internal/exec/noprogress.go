// The no-progress guard, and why a leaf that is not making forward progress
// must be stopped.
//
// Measured: one bug replicate spent 1.3M tokens and 184 seconds with no forward
// progress — the model re-reading files it had already read, re-running the
// same checks, and circling. The token ceiling eventually caught it, but only
// after it had spent an order of magnitude more than the same task should ever
// cost, and the landing reserve meant the last several turns were paid for
// too. The turn cap at 400 is the only thing that would have reached it sooner,
// and 400 is the number that was raised from 40 precisely because it stopped
// honest complex work.
//
// What was missing is a signal that distinguishes "a leaf taking many turns
// because the work is hard" from "a leaf taking many turns because it is
// stuck". The difference is observable and it is general: a leaf that is
// making progress writes to the filesystem, reads files it has not read
// before, or calls tools with arguments it has not used before. A leaf that is
// not doing any of those three things is not working — it is repeating itself
// — and the measured pathology is exactly that shape.
//
// Four signals, and every one is a general criterion rather than a task-shape
// guess:
//
//   - Repeated identical tool calls: the same tool with the same arguments
//     producing the same result, several turns in a row. A model that reads
//     the same file and gets the same answer three times has no reason to
//     read it a fourth.
//   - A stagnant window: several consecutive turns with zero filesystem
//     mutations and zero new information. A big refactor might take many
//     turns, but it writes files between its thinking turns; a leaf that
//     goes five turns without writing anything and without learning anything
//     new is circling.
//   - A turn floor: past a generous multiple of what any honest leaf has ever
//     needed, the leaf is on rails no token bound can see. The floor is well
//     above the measured longest honest leaf (25 turns) and well below the
//     400-turn hard cap, and it fires into a conclude directive rather than a
//     guillotine.
//   - A mutation-free recon run: tool-calling turns that leave the workspace
//     unchanged. THIS ONE ONLY EVER ASKS. A leaf whose deliverable is its
//     answer — a research errand, a review, a question answered out of a
//     repository — reads and mutates nothing by design, so the absence of a
//     write is not evidence of a stall and may never be the reason a leaf is
//     stopped. Each complete span asks for the result and asks again at the
//     next; the measured 45-minute reader is landed by its own wall, with the
//     wall reading telling it where it stands, and a leaf genuinely repeating
//     itself is caught by the first two signals four and six turns in, long
//     before a span completes.
//
// Mutation-free recon spans are advisory only. On any of the other three
// concluding signals the guard first injects a conclude-now directive — one
// chance to land the work — and then, if the leaf is still spinning, terminates
// it with its partial result and a journaled reason. The two-stage exit is the
// same shape the budget landing and the straggler hand-back already take: the
// workspace is left consistent and the partial goes out whole, because the
// work is being returned rather than thrown away.
//
// The thresholds are deliberately generous. This is a tail-risk bound, not a
// budget: it exists to catch the one-in-a-hundred runaway, and it must never
// fire on the ninety-nine honest leaves that happen to be long. Every
// threshold is set clear of the measured distribution of well-sized leaves,
// and the guard errs on the side of firing late.

// StopNoProgress is the reason recorded when the guard terminates a leaf that
// was not making forward progress. It is separate from StopBudget and
// StopTurnCap because it is a different finding: the leaf had money and turns
// left, and was spending both without advancing. Grading it as a budget stop
// would teach the ruler nothing it does not already learn from the budget; the
// distinct reason is what lets the recalibration path see that the node was
// sized correctly and the model was the thing that stalled.
const StopNoProgress StopReason = "no-progress"

// noProgressRepeatCap is how many consecutive identical tool calls (same tool,
// same arguments, same result) the guard tolerates before concluding the leaf
// is repeating itself.
//
// Four is generous against the measured shape of honest work: a model that
// reads a file, processes it, and re-reads to confirm a detail makes the same
// call twice, and a model that runs the same check after a small edit makes
// it twice more. A fourth identical call with an identical result, after the
// workspace has not changed, is the model going round in a circle.
const noProgressRepeatCap = 4

// noProgressStagnantCap is how many consecutive turns with zero filesystem
// mutations and zero new information the guard tolerates.
//
// Six sits clear of the honest leaf that thinks between writes. A big refactor
// might spend two or three turns reasoning before each edit, and a leaf that
// reads several files before acting can go four or five turns between
// mutations. Six consecutive turns with neither a mutation nor a single new
// result is the leaf circling, and the cap fires into a conclude directive
// rather than a stop.
const noProgressStagnantCap = 6

// noProgressReconTurns is how many consecutive tool-calling turns may leave
// the workspace unchanged before the leaf is asked to produce its result.
//
// Ten is deliberately beyond noProgressStagnantCap, the measured ceiling on
// consecutive turns that learn nothing, so a leaf legitimately gathering new
// material has more room than a stagnant one before it hears the notice. It is
// also half of the twenty turns where measured budget-bound leaves landed, so
// the first notice arrives with a leaf's worth of turns still available to act
// on it.

// noProgressTurnFloor is the turn count past which the guard stops needing
// the stagnant signal to fire — but only against a leaf whose recent window
// is mostly unproductive. The signals above catch fast spins (identical
// repeats, six flat turns); what they cannot catch is the leaf that fidgets
// just enough to dodge them: one write or one fresh read every few turns,
// forever. The floor names that pattern: past this many turns with fewer
// than noProgressFloorMinProductive productive turns in the recent window,
// the leaf is on rails no token bound can see, and the conclude directive is
// the gentle way to land it. A leaf that is genuinely working — mutations or
// new information in its recent window — is never floor-stopped: the leaf's
// own turn and token budgets own that ceiling, exactly as the engine's step
// budgets do.
const noProgressTurnFloor = 60

// noProgressFloorWindow and noProgressFloorMinProductive shape the recent
// window the floor reads: of the last twenty turns, fewer than five with a
// mutation or new information is fidgeting. Five-of-twenty is exactly the
// slowest honest cadence the signals already tolerate (one productive turn
// every five keeps the stagnant counter from ever reaching six), so any leaf
