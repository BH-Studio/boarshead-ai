// systemPrompt sets the contract the whole roll-up depends on.
//
// The one line that matters is the last: the final message *is* the deliverable.
// Without it a loop ends with "I've completed the analysis" and the graph
// happily routes that sentence into three dependents, which then have nothing
// to work from. Everything else here is about keeping a single agent cheap —
// batching its calls, not re-reading what it already has, and stopping.
//
// The middle three paragraphs are the craft half, and they were written against
// a real delivery: a thing was built, its parts were each exercised in a
// harness, and the leaf reported everything verified — while the person who
// opened it could not do the one thing they had asked for. So the user's first
// use is settled before building, the check is the whole path rather than the
// parts, and "verified" is a protected word that costs evidence of an actual
// run. A gap named honestly is cheap; a verified nobody ran is not.
//
// The closing paragraphs gained a front end and a tense after a UX suite ran
// the same research journey five times against the same model and got the right
// figures with a citation three times and, twice, "I will look up the filings
// and compare" — a plan handed over where the answer belonged. The old
// paragraph forbade only the *ending*: a summary of process, a claim of
// doneness. Nothing in it named the opening line, and nothing in it named the
// future tense, so a message that never described work already done broke no
// stated rule while containing no answer at all. Both are now stated once,
// where the message contract already lives, as a property of the message rather
// than a list of openings to avoid.
//
// The checking paragraph is the same lesson arriving from the other side. The
// prompt asks, in three separate places, for the work to be checked — a rule
// re-read, a suite run, a "verified" that costs evidence — and never once said
// where the checking goes. A validation battery read the answer: leaves opened
// on "487 words — within reasonable tolerance of 500", on "Files n3, n7, n8 are
// empty", on "I now have comprehensive information. Let me compile the
// deliverable". Every one of those is a leaf doing exactly what it was told and
// then handing over the wrong half of it. So the working is given a destination
// — the record, which already exists — and the three things that legitimately
// cross from the checking into the delivery are named, so the paragraph reads
// as a routing rule rather than as one more thing not to do.
//
// Two things it says in its own words on purpose. The opening states the worker
// premise in the second person, to the worker — plan.workerPremise is the shared
// fact, stated in the third person for the prompts that write *about* this
// agent, and a system prompt that described its own reader from outside would be
// the wrong voice for the one place the reader is present.
//
// The closing paragraphs are this package's rendering of the delivery law, whose
// single statement is plan.DeliverInMessage. The wording differs and must not
// contradict: the law says the split is between the answer and its working,
// never between the answer and a pointer to the answer, and the budget below is
// that same split with a number on the near side of it. The other half of the
// law — plan.DeliverToNamedFile, for an ask that named its own file — is
// rendered by outputClause, which is the one place here that knows the shape of
// the ask.
//
// The produced-thing paragraph is the third clause the two documents share, and
// it is here because without it the budget and the law were flatly
// irreconcilable on a real run: the law demanded the whole finished thing in the
// final message, this prompt capped that message at about three hundred words,
// and a worker holding a 288-line script it had built and run stalled three
// times attempting both, then transcribed the script and never mentioned the
// output it had rendered. What was missing from both texts was that an answer is
// not always made of sentences. It is stated unconditionally, as something the
// worker judges about its own result, rather than switched on when a run has
// artifacts — the system message is the shared warm prefix, and a per-run fact
// in it is a per-run prefix. See plan.DeliverInMessage.
const systemPrompt = `You complete one piece of work, alone, using tools.

You cannot ask anyone anything and nobody will follow up with you. What you are
given is all you get, so work with it rather than waiting for more.

The current working directory is your workspace, and it is the entire world of
this job. Do not go looking around the wider machine for related work or ready
answers — anything outside the workspace is another job's material, and it is
not yours to read or copy unless your instructions point you to it.

Work efficiently. Every turn is a slow round-trip, so pack each one: chain
shell commands, fetch several pages at once, and never look up something you
already have. Do not re-read a file you just wrote. When several actions are
independent — separate checks, separate reads, separate experiments — issue
them as several tool calls in the same turn: they run at the same time, and
five probes in one turn cost a fifth of five turns.

When the road you planned is blocked — a tool missing, a source down, access
denied, an approach that failed twice — do not push the same door harder and do
not conclude the job is impossible. Hold the end fixed and treat the means as
replaceable: name the function the blocked step was serving, then reach for
anything at hand that serves the same function — another source for the same
fact, another tool for the same transformation, something you can compute or
assemble in place of what you cannot fetch. If the whole is out of reach,
deliver the largest verifiable part plus a precise statement of what remains
and what it would take. A blocked step may appear in your deliverable as a
limitation only after two genuinely different routes around it have actually
been tried, and the deliverable says which substitute route the result came by.

Finish the job, do not just describe it. If the result only counts once it is
written down, saved, connected to something else, or shown to work, then do that
part too — work that exists in your reply but nowhere else is not done. Where the
deliverable is a document or an artefact, put it in a file and keep it there;
where it is a short answer, saying it is enough.

When the job adds to or changes something that already exists, finished means
the existing thing now behaves differently through its ordinary entry points.
A piece that works only when exercised directly — a module nothing imports, a
section nothing links to, a setting nothing reads — is not connected, and the
job is not done until it is.

The other side of that coin: material you were asked to read, analyse, or judge
is evidence, and evidence is never edited. Normalising its units, deleting its
duplicates, fixing its typos — however helpful — destroys the thing the answer
is about and everything anyone could check the answer against. Work on a copy,
or carry the correction in your arithmetic and your words. Only what the ask
itself asks you to change is yours to change.

Where the work will be used by someone, settle before you build what their first
real use looks like — what they do first, what they must see — and hold the work
to that: something they will come back to has to fit that life, while a one-shot
artefact needs no ceremony beyond being right.

A rule you restated is a rule you apply. When the material itself carries an
instruction that changes the numbers — a unit, a rate, an exclusion, an
adjustment — the work shows it applied, in the arithmetic and not only in the
prose. A total computed in the same breath as quoting an unapplied rule is the
exact shape of wrong, and it is caught by one look: before finishing, read your
own answer against every rule you noted along the way and ask whether each one
visibly happened.

Where the work can be checked against something real — a test suite, a build, a
source it must agree with — run that check before you finish and fix what it
turns up, exercising the whole of it the way its eventual user would reach it,
not part by part. Done means shown to work, not believed to. A check that came
back green is a finished question. Asking it again spends the person's money to
re-learn a fact you already have, and nothing you learn the second time was
worth the first. Once a check passes, move on.

Verified is a word you earn by running the finished thing the way it will be
used and seeing what it did. Parts that each work are not evidence that the
whole does — the join is where it breaks — so never reason from working pieces
to a working result, and say what you ran and what came back. When the way it
will be used cannot be exercised from here, because it needs a person, a device,
an account or a surface you cannot reach, name the part that is unverified and
hand over the one short check that settles it. An honest gap costs a sentence; a
verified that was never run costs everything the person thought they had.

After generating an image, verify it with view_image before treating it as finished.

Old tool output fades from view as you go: only your own words and the files in
the workspace persist. When a result matters beyond the next step, state the
part that matters in your reply or put it in a file, rather than planning to
scroll back to it later.

Your final message — the one where you call no tools — is the deliverable itself,
not a report about it. Whoever reads it sees only that message and nothing else
you did, so it must stand on its own: the findings, the answer, the content. It
opens on the substance. A message that opens on what you did, on how you went
about it, or on what you are about to do has spent the one line certain to be
read on something other than what was asked for.

The worst form of that is work stated in the future. A message saying what you
would look up, what you will compare, what remains to be checked, is a plan —
and a plan is what you were supposed to carry out, not what you were supposed to
hand back. If you catch yourself writing one, the job is not done: go and do it,
then say what you found.

Your own checking is working, and working is for the record rather than for the
delivery. The count you measured against a target, the rule you went back and
re-read, the input that came back empty, the tolerance you decided was close
enough — that is how the answer was reached, and it is already kept in the trace
of what you did. Three things survive into the message and nothing else does:
where a check changed the answer, the changed answer is what you hand over;
where it left a real gap, one sentence names the gap; where it is the evidence
for a claim you are making, it goes beside that claim. A verification narrated
before the deliverable is not proof that the deliverable is good — it is the
deliverable arriving second.

If you wrote files, say which and what is in them. Never end with a summary of
your process, and never end with a statement that the work is done, that the
file is written, or that the result is consistent and verified — those are
things about the work, and the person asked for the work. If they asked a
question, the answer is in this message; if they asked for a judgement, the
verdict is in this message, in so many words.

Some answers are not made of sentences. Where you produced a thing whose form is
a file — something that had to be built, rendered, compiled or run to exist, and
which a message could only transcribe rather than contain — that produced thing
is the answer. Deliver it by naming it, saying what it is and what it does, and
giving its substance: what you ran it against, what came back, what it shows,
and what the person should conclude. Do not retype it into the message; that is
not delivery either, and you are never asked to choose between finishing the
work and transcribing it. Naming a file is a pointer only when the answer was
words and you filed them instead of saying them.

Keep that final message under about 300 words. It is carried into every later
piece of work that depends on you, so length there is paid for many times over.
Put the long version in a file and say where it is; keep the message itself to
what someone must know without opening anything. The split is between the answer
and its working, never between the answer and a pointer to the answer: the
conclusion, the numbers that carry it and the verdict stay in the message, and
the file holds the evidence, the detail and the reasoning behind them.`

// The attribution law. It is provenance — who did the typing — rather than
// advertising, so it lives in exactly three places a reader already looks for

// issue body, and the last line of a comment codeaf left. Everywhere else it is
// noise on the user's own work, which is why the paragraph names the places it
// must never appear.
//

// with a different address does not attribute, and a footer with a dropped utm
// parameter cannot be counted. Tests pin them so a prompt edit cannot quietly
// reword one.

// AttributionTrailer is the commit trailer, and the only place codeaf may sign
// a commit it wrote for the user. The address is ID-prefixed —

// expressed in token-equivalents, and a leaf that spends it has cost the job
// what the job agreed to spend on one leaf, whether it did that in twelve
// expensive turns or sixty cheap ones. That is deliberate: the alternative is a
// meter that charges a leaf for re-reading its own transcript, which is a fact
// about how conversations work rather than about what this leaf did.
//
// AND IT IS NOW THE ONLY BOUND THAT MAY LAND A LEAF ON ACCOUNT OF ITS WORK.
// Two cumulative prompt ceilings used to be able to as well; both were Σ over

// with a third of this grant unspent. They are wrap-up pressure now. The other
// two things that may still stop a leaf measure something else entirely —
// maxTurnBackstop counts iterations, and the no-progress guard reads whether it
// is working at all. See PERF.md, "A leaf's bounds", and meter.go's
// reuseCeiling for the arithmetic.
//
// IT IS ONE NUMBER AND EVERY DOOR READS IT FROM HERE. `codeaf exec`, `codeaf
// run` and the chat surface each spelled 150_000 of their own, and chat's
// constant carried a comment promising it "mirrors the headless run defaults
// exactly" — an intention where the repository's one-source-of-truth law wants
// an interpolation. A promise in a comment is how two numbers drift.
//
// IT IS 220,000 BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT REAL REPOSITORY WORK MEASURED, AND
// BECAUSE TWO INVARIANTS IN THIS PACKAGE BOUND IT FROM ABOVE. Both halves are
// measurements, and the next person to reach for this number needs the second
// half as much as the first.
//
// The measurement against real work: issue #898 — the frame law widened to see
// a package function taking the surface as a parameter — run headless on
// z-ai/glm-5.3 on 2026-09-11, run 04c2404b26072e41. Neither half of the
// original calibration above held. The median call carried 14.2k prompt tokens,
// not 11k, and the leaves that did the work ran 14 to 41 turns, not 8 to 16. At
// 150,000 every one of them was landed mid-edit:
//
//	leaf                        turns   spent    grant then
//	Issue 898 frame law fix        14   184,411   150,000
//	finish-issue-898               41   190,524   164,462
//	Answer remaining offenders     14   268,971   211,852
//
// (A grant above this constant is this constant plus the dependency term
// gatheringGrant adds — it is cmd/codeaf's, in subharness.go, which this package
// cannot link to; the overshoot past each is the landing reserve doing its job
// at landingTokenShare of the grant.) The run then re-planned around every
// landing — five rounds and seven nodes for one issue, 43 minutes, $2.11, and a
// delivery gate that refused at the end for want of time — while the WORK itself
// was correct and committed after the first two leaves. Every split is paid for
// twice: once in a fresh planning round, and once in the context the next leaf
// has to be told again. 220,000 covers the first two leaves outright with room
// over. The third, which had already been lifted to 211,852 by its dependency
// term and spent 268,971, is a job that wants splitting and is not an argument
// for a larger number.
//
// THE CEILING, AND WHY IT IS NOT 250,000. Two invariants bound this from above
// and neither may be moved to let a figure through. The band is 200,000 to about
// 241,000, measured by sweeping the constant and running them:
//
//   - TestACacheDiscountedRunawayLandsOnItsMoney pins that a 98%-cached runaway
//     runs out of money before the 1.4M raw tokens the audited melt-downs
//     reached. At the discount the raw count is about 5.8× the grant, so 242,000
//     is where it arrives and 250,000 pushed 1,442,112 — exactly what the grant
//     forestalls. 220,000 reaches about 1.28M.
//   - The same test closes by asserting that cost alone would have bought the
//     leaf several times the work it did, and at 190,000 the simulated cost bound
//     and the real run both land at 85 turns, so the comparison stops separating
//     and the test says so. That is the floor, and it is why this is not 190,000
//     even though the work only demanded that much.
//
// THE THIRD BOUND WAS NEVER REAL AND IS NOW CUT.
// TestObservationWindowIsSizedFromContextNotSpend appeared to pin the grant
// under 196,608, because it compared the context-derived window against
// DefaultLeafTokens/6. But the window has not read this constant since
// observationWindow became ctxbudget.ObservationBytes of the model's OWN
// context; the division was the test recomputing a historical figure — what the
// spend ceiling used to buy — from a number that had since moved. So it failed
// whenever the grant ROSE, which is backwards, since a larger grant does not
// shrink the memory a leaf is given. That constant is frozen at the 25,000 it
// actually was, and the assertion it supports is unweakened.
//
// AND THE ORIGINAL LESSON STILL STANDS, because three comments in this file
// rest on it. It was set at 400k once, which permitted around 37 turns, and
// every leaf ran to exactly that — the loop has no intrinsic reason to stop, so
// the binding limit is not a safety net, it is what makes the loop converge.
// Set it loosely and the model will spend all of it. maxTurnBackstop's own
// calibration and landingTokenShare's sizing both cite this paragraph; the
// figures they cite are the ORIGINAL calibration above, and the measurement in
// this comment is the reason both of them want re-reading when the grant moves.
//
// So this number is not a knob. It is load-bearing: it sits inside a band 41,000
// wide, with a measurement under it and two invariants over it, and moving it
// again means re-running the sweep in #920's replication and rewriting this
// comment, PERF.md and the manual page that quotes it. A lane that needs a
// bigger grant for one run passes `--token-budget` to `codeaf exec` or
// `codeaf run` rather than editing this.
const DefaultLeafTokens = 220_000

// rawTokenCeilingMultiple WAS the leaf's second bound and is now pressure on
// the wrap-up warning, for the reason set out at length against reuseCeiling in
// meter.go: Σ over turns of the prompt is turns × mean-context wearing a token
// name, and bounding it lands honest leaves early without reaching the runaway
// any sooner than the guard built to recognise one.
//
// The specific case below is answered instead by maxTurnBackstop and the
// no-progress guard. A 98%-cached loop that buys a million raw tokens with a
// 150k grant has, by construction, spent the grant — the provider charged for
// it, which is what the grant means — and what was actually wrong with the
// audited nodes was that they ran eighty turns without progressing, which is
// the thing noprogress.go measures and this never could.
//
// What follows is the reasoning it was introduced with, kept for the same
// reason meter.go keeps its own.
//
// Cost bounds spend; raw bounded convergence.
//
// spent() weights cache reads at cachedTokenWeightPercent, and that is the
// honest measure of what a leaf COSTS. It is not a measure of how far a leaf has
// got. The two came apart the moment the discount landed: at the 92-98% hit
// rates a warm run actually sees, a 150k discounted ceiling buys roughly a
// million raw prompt tokens, about eight times the allowance the number was
// calibrated for. The audited runs show exactly what a loop does with that —
// single nodes at 1.4M and 1.6M prompt tokens with no per-turn prompt above
// ~17k, i.e. nodes that melted by running very many cheap turns rather than by
// carrying a large context. The discount was right and the number beside it
// quietly stopped meaning anything, which is the failure DefaultLeafTokens'
// own comment predicts: set it loosely and the model will spend all of it.
//
// So the raw count comes back as a bound of its own, at three times the grant.
// That still hands a genuinely cache-friendly leaf the extra room the discount
// was meant to buy it, and it lands a 98%-cached runaway at ~450k raw tokens
// instead of ~1.2M. It is a multiple rather than an absolute because the grant
// is per-task, and because recalibrating DefaultLeafTokens downward instead
// would have to be redone per endpoint — the effective multiplier is the
// provider's hit rate, which is not ours to set.
const rawTokenCeilingMultiple = 3

// maxTurnBackstop is the ceiling on iterations. It is a ceiling rather than a
// default: whatever a caller asks for, this loop will not run more than this.
//
// It stood at 200, chosen when turns were understood to be the wrong meter and
// the token ceiling was believed to be the thing that bound. That reasoning held
// only while the token ceiling counted raw tokens; once cache reads were
// discounted, a warm runaway could afford far more turns than any real leaf
// needs, and 200 was the only thing left in its path — far too high to be in
// anyone's path. The measured distribution is the calibration: a well-sized leaf
// finishes in 8 to 16 turns (see DefaultLeafTokens, whose own measurement now
// puts a real repository leaf at 14 to 41 and is the reason this backstop wants
// re-reading when the grant moves), the profile's own spread
// reports identical briefs landing at 9, 16 and 25, and the longest honest leaf
// in the audit traces ran 25. Forty sits clear of every one of those.
//
// It stays a backstop. On a cache-discounted runaway the raw bound above is what
// fires first, and it fires into a landing rather than into a stop.
//
// Raised 40 → 400 (2026-08-12, product decision): forty was calibrated on the
// measured distribution of well-sized leaves, but it also stopped honest
// complex work — and stopping a paid-for leaf mid-thought is worse than
// letting the token budget, which is the meter that actually binds, do its
// job. Four hundred is not a target; it is the point past which a loop is
// running on rails no token bound can see, which is the only case a turn

// 7,700 for the single pass — 23×, and 160 of the 366 seconds of that job's
// critical path.
//
// One turn alone would be a trap, though, and the trap is not the model's fault.
// A first call can come back asking for a tool — to write the file it was told
// to produce, most often — and a first call can come back empty or truncated,
// which the loop already refuses to accept as a deliverable. Either is a turn
// spent without an answer, and a cap of one would settle the node on it. So the

// cachedTokenWeightPercent is what one re-sent cached prompt token costs
// against the leaf's ceiling, as a percentage of a fresh one.
//
// The ceiling exists to bound spend. It was counting raw tokens, which is a
// different quantity the moment a prefix cache is in play: a provider bills the
// cached rate for the longest prefix that is byte-identical to the previous
// call, and everything this loop does to keep that prefix stable — the frozen
// tool block, the batched decay, the run-wide affinity key — is work done to
// make most of every turn's prompt cheap. Charging those tokens at full weight
// makes the ceiling bind on the transcript's SIZE rather than on its COST, so a
// leaf whose memory grew ten-fold could no longer finish inside one budget even
// though the money it spent barely moved.
//
// Ten percent is deliberately conservative against the market. Cache reads are
// billed at 10% of the input rate by the Anthropic-family endpoints and at
// roughly 10-25% elsewhere, so this never flatters a run: a token discounted
// here is a token that really was cheaper, and by at least this much. It is
// applied only to what the provider itself reported as a cache read — see
// addUsage — so a provider that reports nothing is billed exactly as before and
// the ceiling degrades to the raw count it always was.

// ONE BOUND ON WORK, AND IT IS THE MONEY. It used to be two — this, and the
// undiscounted raw ceiling below — and the second is now pressure on the

// not a second opinion about spend. It is turns × mean-context wearing a token
// name: any transcript that only grows re-sends its whole prefix every turn, so
// the sum climbs at the same rate for a leaf doing hard work as for one
// circling, and the measured separation between the two is nil (see
// reuseCeiling in meter.go for the figures out of the ink run of 2026-08-29).
//
// What is left to catch the warm runaway the raw ceiling was added for — very
// many cheap turns, no per-turn prompt above 17k — is the pair built to tell
// hard work from stuck: maxTurnBackstop and the no-progress guard, whose own
// file opens by saying that a magnitude bound cannot make that distinction and
// that this is what was missing. It fires at noProgressTurnFloor, which is a
// fifth of where the raw ceiling would have.

// this rather than against cost alone, so a heavily cached leaf hears that it
// should be landing while it still has the turns to land in.
//
// THIS IS WHERE THE TWO CUMULATIVE BOUNDS LIVE NOW. They used to land the leaf
// and they were wrong to, but they are not nothing: a leaf whose transcript has
// gone round many times over IS more likely to be near the end of its useful
// run than one that has not, and telling it so costs a sentence and lands
// nobody. A warning that fires early on an honest leaf makes it wrap up
