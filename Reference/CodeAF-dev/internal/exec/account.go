// Account is a worker's own account of the work it did, in the one shape every
// reader downstream needs and none of them can reconstruct.
//
// It exists because of a measured, expensive silence. A subharness that drives
// a whole pipeline behind a process boundary used to hand back one sentence and
// a bill, and when the pipeline ended without a verdict of its own the sentence
// was "it ended without saying how it went" — a void. Three readers then had to
// act on that void: the delivery gate judged it and reacted differently every
// time, the remainder judge could not tell finished work from unstarted work
// and added children to re-investigate what was already done, and the person
// reading the record was told nothing at all. Between 48% and 57% of a run's
// cost was measured going into that re-investigation.
//
// So the account is structural rather than prose: the files the work changed
// with the kind of change and its size, the commands it issued itself, the
// checks the closing photograph ran with what each one found, and the last thing
// the worker said for itself. Nothing here is interpreted — every field is a
// measured fact no reader further down could observe for itself — and nothing
// here is worker-specific. Any subharness that owns a verifier can fill it in,
// which is why it is named for what it is rather than for who writes it first.
//
// A nil Account is the ordinary case: a worker that photographs nothing leaves
// it empty, and an empty account reads as "no claim" everywhere it is rendered.

	//

	// one. Whether work was DONE is answered by the repository — files, a range,
	// a diff — and stayed true of a leaf whose delivery gate failed, because the
