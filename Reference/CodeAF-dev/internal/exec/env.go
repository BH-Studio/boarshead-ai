// ONE ENV, TWO CONSUMERS — and this file is the wound being closed.
//
// The tree already had two drifting things called Env: internal/subharness's
// (exec_model.go, an interface over the five DAG node kinds) and the session's
// implementation of the same interface over its own belt. The seam between them
// is written up at cmd/codeaf/chatv3_harness.go as a known wound, in the two
// absences it produced — a gate with nobody to ask, and a model the conversation
// could not move. PRD §5 says plainly: do not mint a third. So this is the one,
// and it is the one for both consumers at once.
//
//   - It is the HOST API handed to a JavaScript bundle. goja has no filesystem,
//     no network and no clock unless the host hands them in, so the six methods
//     below are the ENTIRE capability surface of a bundle. There is no seventh
//     way to spend, reach out, or ask.
//   - It is the INTERFACE handed to a Go runner. A subharness compiled into this
//     binary gets the same six doors and no more, which is what makes "the person
//     cannot tell which is which" a structural fact rather than a promise.
//
// EVERY TOKEN AND EVERY DOLLAR FLOWS THROUGH ai() AND tool(). That is what makes
// the ledger complete without the ledger having to be everywhere: a program
// cannot spend any other way, so summing the journal's entries is summing the
// run. And every call here is JOURNALED BEFORE ITS ANSWER RETURNS (journal.go) —
// an implementation that answered first and wrote afterwards would leave a run
// killed mid-call with no record of the call that killed it.
//
// The bodies behind these doors are the runtime lane's. [UnwiredEnv] below is
// what a caller that has not wired one yet hands over, and it is honest about
// having nothing behind it rather than pretending to work.
type Env interface {
	// AI is one model call. promptRef NAMES A PROMPT ASSET IN THE BUNDLE and is
	// never an inline string: prompts are files under prompts/ so they can be
	// diffed, reviewed, revised into a new version, and — later — carry their
	// own accepted-output cache per call site. A program that could inline its
