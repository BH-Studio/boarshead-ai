// THE RUNNER: a subharness is a FUNCTION, not a chat.
//
// That sentence is PRD §4 and it is the keystone every downstream feature leans
// on. A run takes typed input, produces typed output, and ends either having
// produced its declared shape or INCOMPLETE with a reason. There is no third
// ending, and in particular there is no "done with a strange message" — which
// was the only ending the old one-string program form could offer, and the
// reason nothing downstream of a run could ever be built on it.
//
// Two implementations are real and the contract permits no more than it has to:
//
//   - A GO RUNNER implements this natively and is registered at compile time.
//     The owner's custom Go subharnesses land here first-class with zero porting,
//     and the worker itself is re-fronted through it ([ExecutorRunner]).
//   - THE JS RUNNER IS ONE GENERIC GO RUNNER parameterized by a bundle. There is
//     not one runner per bundle: there is one goja host, and a bundle is its
//     argument. The runtime lane builds it; this file defines the door it comes
//     through ([BundleSource]).
//
// Future runners — a subprocess, WASM — are permitted by this shape and are not
// being built. Nothing here may be complicated by their possibility.
