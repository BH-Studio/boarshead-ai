// The seam by which a worker's turns reach the record.
//
// A leaf used to be observable only by what it left on disk. When it left
// nothing — and a leaf could burn 1.29M prompt tokens and fifty cents and leave
// nothing — there was no way to say what it had done,
// because its transcript lived in a slice that went away with the process. The
// fix is not a log file: a log file is not addressable by node, is not there
// when someone asks a week later, and is not what the rest of this system means
// by a record. The fix is that the loop tells somebody, every turn, and that
// somebody writes it down under the node.
//
// WHY A CONTEXT VALUE AND NOT A FIELD ON THE EXECUTOR. The sink has to reach
// every worker on both surfaces — the chat's leaves and `codeaf do`'s — and
// those two reach their workers through different doors: cmd/codeaf's
// executorFor on one side and an exec.Registry built once per run on the other.
// A constructor field would have to be threaded through both, through
// leafBuild, and through every executor that does not want one; and it would be
// wrong for the registry, whose executors are built once and shared by every
// node while a sink belongs to ONE attempt at ONE node. The context is already
// per-attempt and already carries the call's shape (provider.WithCallShape) and
// its observer (provider.WithStreamObserver) for exactly these reasons. This is
// that idiom, one rung up.
//
// Nobody listening is the normal case — a unit test, a bench harness, any
// caller with no store — and it costs one type assertion and a nil check per
// turn.

// TranscriptSink receives one leaf's turns as they happen.
//
// Record is called from the loop goroutine, and may be called concurrently by
// tools that run in parallel, so an implementation must be safe for concurrent
// use. Flush makes everything recorded so far durable and must be safe to call
// more than once, including after the run is over: the runner flushes on every
// way out of a leaf, and a leaf that is abandoned on the clock goes on
// recording into a sink that has already been flushed once.

// before settling — which is the failure this machinery exists for. So a full
// batch is written the moment it fills, and the runner flushes the remainder on
// every exit. A hard kill of the process costs at most the last partial batch.
//
// THE WRITE HAPPENS UNDER THE LOCK, synchronously, in the caller's goroutine.
// An async writer would buy back a few milliseconds per sixty-four entries and
// would owe a shutdown handshake that a panicking leaf cannot perform; the
// turns it records are separated by provider round-trips measured in seconds,
// so there is no hot path here to protect.
