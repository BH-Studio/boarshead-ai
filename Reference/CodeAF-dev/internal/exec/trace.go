// tracer writes one node's turn-by-turn transcript to a file under the
// workspace's harness directory. See traceDir for why it is not the observation
// directory, which is where it used to live and where leaves kept finding it.
//
// It exists because the loop's failures were invisible. A node that ran 139
// turns and wrote nothing reported only "exhausted its token budget" — every
// hypothesis about what those turns contained had to be tested by re-running
// the task at full price. The trace is the flight recorder: cheap, local,
// always on, and read only when something needs explaining.
//
// Always on is what makes the buffering necessary. A subharness stream can
// deliver a thousand NDJSON deltas a second and every one of them is a line
// here, which was a string concatenation and a write syscall each. The writes
// are batched and flushed at record boundaries instead — the end of a turn, the
// end of a poll interval, and the close — so a crash costs the tail of the
// current batch and nothing before it. The mutex is not new caution: the child's
// stdout and its stderr are traced from two goroutines at once, and a shared
// buffer is not a file handle.
// THE RECORDER IS PROSE AND THE STREAM IS NOT. A subharness drives a child that
// speaks NDJSON, and for as long as those lines were `note`d the recorder was
// two documents in one file: a few dozen sentences a person reads, buried under
// thousands of `{"id":"evt_…","type":"message.part.delta",…}`. The room that
// draws this file draws one row per line it cannot parse, so a 2MB stream became
// screens of raw JSON presented as content (internal/tui2/chat/trace.go's
// parseTrace, default branch). The stream is not deleted — it is the flight
// recorder's most valuable half — it is moved one file sideways, to
// `<node>.stream.ndjson`, and the recorder keeps a single pointer note to it.
// What a person reads and what a debugger greps are two documents, and they get
// two files.

	// THE RECORD OF A TURN GOES BOTH PLACES OR IT GOES NOWHERE USEFUL. This

	// node, it is not there when somebody asks a week later, and a continuation
	// cannot be seeded from it. The store's transcript is the durable half, and
	// until this it had exactly one writer in the whole tree, and not this one

	// recorded nothing durable at all: the ink run of 2026-08-29 ran three
	// leaves on it and left a store with zero transcript rows, so BankedRun
	// found nothing, every continuation started cold, and the resumption the
	// lease lane had built could never fire.

	// takes and every harness note already passes through this one object —
