// WHAT THE PLANNER IS ALLOWED TO SAY, and what happens to a sentence that is
// not one of those things.
//
// A planner is a model, so its answer arrives as text that is meant to be an
// [Amendment] and sometimes is not. Three separate failures live on that path
// and they are answered separately, cheapest first:
//
//	the reply is not JSON      the salvage ladder (internal/subharness) fixes
//	                           the fence, the prose, the smart quotes; the
//	                           session's planner spends ONE repair turn on what
//	                           is left (orchestrate.go's plannerRepair)
//	the JSON is not an         strict decoding refuses it: a key nobody asked
//	amendment                  for is a model answering a different question
//	the amendment is not       validation here refuses it against the frontier
//	legal against THIS run     as it stands, and a planner that can be handed
//	                           its own refusal ([Repairer]) gets one try
//
// What survives all three is applied. What does not is DROPPED WITH A NOTE —
// never guessed at, never half-applied. A run whose planner is talking nonsense
// keeps executing the frontier it already has, which is the only safe reading
// of "the scheduler never thinks".
