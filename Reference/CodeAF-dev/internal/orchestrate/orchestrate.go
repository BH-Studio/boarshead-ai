// Package orchestrate is the adaptive runner: a planner model and a frontier
// scheduler, married. The planner never works and the scheduler never thinks.
// A node's needs are the only launch gate code consults; the planner amends
// the frontier on every completion, concurrently, so execution never blocks
// on thought. The graph is never designed — it crystallizes as the trace of
// what the planner did.
//
// This file is the CONTRACT: types the session, the room, the roster, and the
// rig all code against. Behavior lands behind these shapes.

// this constant, and the rail column that draws these rows cuts to the same

// NodeTitle is the name one node is drawn under, and it is the ONLY place in
// this package that answers the question — so every surface asking it gets the
// same answer, and none of them has to invent one.
//
// TWO ANSWERS, AND NEITHER OF THEM READS THE GOAL. The planner's own title is
// taken as written, because a model that was asked to name the slice has done
// exactly the work a namer would be paid to do again. When there is none — an
// older planner, a reply that lost the key, a node this package minted itself
// ([Orchestrator.synthesize]) — the name is built from the ID, which the law
// already requires to be a slug: `token-bucket` is `token bucket`, and that is
// a derivation from a structured field rather than a sentence cut short.
//
// A GOAL IS NEVER A NAME. That is the whole point of the field, and a fallback
// that reached for the goal would put the defect back the moment a planner
// forgot the key.
//
// THE SECOND ANSWER IS THE LAST RESORT AND NOT THE PLAN. An id only reads as a
// name when the planner spelt one into it, and half the ids models mint are
// `r1`, `n3`, `synth` — filing, not language. Those are the ones
// [NodeNeedsName] picks out and [Options.Name] replaces before anybody reads
