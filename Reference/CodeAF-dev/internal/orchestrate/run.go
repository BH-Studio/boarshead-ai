package orchestrate

// THE RUN: a scheduler that never thinks, beside a planner that never works.
//
// Everything here is arranged around one refusal — EXECUTION NEVER WAITS ON
// THOUGHT. A node's needs are the only launch gate, they are checked in code,
// and the moment they are met the node goes. The planner is called once at the
// start and once per completion, on a goroutine of its own, and what it answers
// lands on the frontier whenever it lands. A planner that takes forty seconds
// to say NOOP costs the run nothing, because the run was never stopped.
//
// THE FOUR LAWS THE LOOP IS WRITTEN AGAINST.
//
//   - THE COMMITMENT LAW. An amendment adds and cancels PENDING nodes. A node
//     that is running was launched on a judgement somebody already made, and a
//     planner allowed to retract that judgement mid-flight would leave work in
//     the world with nothing to attach it to (amend.go holds the check).
//   - ONE TANK. Every model call anywhere in the run — the nodes, the planner,
//     the synthesis — bills against one fuel cap (fuel.go). At the cap the
//     scheduler stops launching, in-flight nodes finish, and Run BLOCKS at the
//     gate until somebody answers it.
//   - DIGESTS ONLY. Dependents and the planner see a node's condensed output,
//     never its artifact. The planner is the one big-context call in the system
//     and it stays small on purpose.
//   - THE RUN ALWAYS SETTLES. A planner that never says done, a node whose
//     needs failed, a graph that ran out of launchable work — each of those
//     ends the loop and goes to synthesis over what is actually there. The one
//     way to hang is a person who never answers the gate, which is a person's
//     decision and is resumable.

	OnNote func(text string)
	// OnFuel is the gauge's early warning, fired ONCE when spend crosses
	// [WarnMark]. It is not a running meter: a surface that wants the figure
	// at any other moment reads it off [Orchestrator.Snapshot].
	OnFuel func(f Fuel)
	// OnPause fires when the tank is empty and the run has stopped launching.
	// The answer comes back through [Orchestrator.Resolve].
	OnPause func(f Fuel)
	// OnNodes carries the crystallized graph every time any of it moves — a node
	// launched, a node landed, a node the planner added or a person cancelled. It
	// is the same slice [Snapshot.Nodes] carries, published at the same moment and
	// for a reader that cannot poll: the session registers a run's nodes as a task
	// FAMILY so the roster has a tree to draw (session's orchestrate.go), and a
	// registration driven by polling would be a clock asking a run whether
	// anything happened.
	//
	// IT IS THE WHOLE GRAPH AND NOT THE NODE THAT MOVED, because a publish is not
	// one transition: [Orchestrator.launch] starts up to a lane's worth at once,
	// and an amendment can add four nodes and cancel one. What moved is a
	// difference the reader already has to compute against what it drew last, so
	// this hands it the state rather than a guess at the event.
	//
	// The slice is the SNAPSHOT'S OWN and is read-only to the callback: writing
	// through it would edit what the next [Orchestrator.Snapshot] hands back.
	OnNodes func(nodes []NodeStatus)

	// Name is asked for the two or three words a node is called when the planner
	// did not write them ([NodeNeedsName] asks the question). It is the BACKSTOP
	// on the law that every row a person reads carries a name: the law asks the
	// planner for one on the call it adds the node, and a planner that answers
	// `{"id": "r1", "goal": …}` anyway is a fact about models rather than a fault
	// this package can refuse — dropping the amendment would throw away the
	// planner's judgement about what work exists to buy three words.
	//
	// THIS PACKAGE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT A MODEL IS, which is why it is a seam. The
	// session wires it to the one small namer everything else in the product is
	// named by (internal/session's taskname.go), so a run's rows and an admitted
	// task's row are named by the same call and read as one column.
	//
	// IT IS CALLED ON A GOROUTINE OF ITS OWN, off the loop, never under the lock,
	// and it may take seconds: NOTHING WAITS FOR IT. The node is on the frontier
	// and launchable before it is asked, the row is already drawn, and the answer
