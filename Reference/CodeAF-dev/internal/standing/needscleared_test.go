// The pass writes this line whole every time it fires an item, so for most of
// this field's life the only way a person could be rid of it was to wait for
// the item to run again. An item that had spent its allowance for the day could
// not run again, so its row stayed on home saying somebody was needed, and
// nothing they did could put it down.
