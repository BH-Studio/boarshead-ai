// Package standing is the ambient side of v3: the things a conversation leaves
// behind that keep working after the window is closed — a reminder, a watch, a
// rule, an overnight job — and the small, honest machinery that wakes them.
//
// THIS FILE IS THE CONTRACT. It was written by hand before any lane started, and
// every lane codes against it: the core lane fills in the store and the ticker,
// the session lane supplies the sentinel and the runner and arms the belt tool,
// the home lane draws items, the errand lane hosts the exchange at home. A field
// or a method added here mid-build is a change every lane has to hear about, so
// the shape is deliberately small and deliberately complete.
//
// ── THE LAWS ──
//
//   - ONE OBJECT, MANY SHAPES. A reminder, a routine, a watch, a rule, an
//     overnight job and a self-proposed follow-up are all an [Item]: the person's
//     words, what wakes it ([When]), what it does ([Action]), and what bounds it
//     ([Rails]). The product's variety is in two fields, not in six mechanisms.
//
//   - THE MECHANISMS ARE CLOSED; THE CONDITION IS OPEN. There are five ways an
//     item can be woken ([WhenKind]) and that list does not grow per feature. But
//     [WhenProbe] is general: the model writes the probe — any shell command, or
//     any tool on the belt with any arguments, including a tool a connected
//     account brought — and a cheap yes/no judgment ([Sentinel]) reads its output
//     against the person's words. "Is CI red", "did Priya reply", "is the cert
//     under 14 days" are all probes; none of them is a kind.
//
//   - FILES, NOT A DATABASE. One JSON document per item, written temp+rename under
//     a per-item flock; an append-only daily ledger for the rails; one folder per
//     run. docs/AMBIENT.md Part 4 has the numbers. Every path is answered by this
//     package and nowhere else, so an index could be added behind it later
//     without a caller changing.
//
//   - NOTHING STANDS UNTIL THE PERSON SAYS YES. [Store.Create] is only ever
//     called after a ratification card was answered yes (a StandingProposal in
//     internal/session). There is no path that arms an item silently.
//
//   - UNATTENDED MEANS WHAT WAS ALREADY ALLOWED. A firing runs under the person's
//     banked approval rules with nobody to ask; anything that would have asked
//     stops the run as "needs your look". This paragraph used to finish "there
//     are no probation counters: the rules are the tenure", and the second half
//     of that is no longer true: [Item.CleanRuns] counts clean firings in a row,
//     and the rope column reads it ([RopeWord]). The first half still is, and it
//     is the part that mattered — the counter changes WHAT A PERSON IS TOLD
//     about an item, never what a firing is allowed to do. What is allowed is
//     the banked rules and only ever the banked rules; nothing here widens with
//     a count.
//
//   - QUIET IS THE DESIGN. A check that found nothing rewrites LastChecked and
//     LastCheckLine in the item and writes NO line anywhere else. A run that
//     delivered nothing is reaped after [RunKeep].
//
//   - STATUS IS DERIVED, NEVER ASSERTED. Whether the OS timer is installed is
//     whether its definition file still matches byte for byte what this build
//     would write; last wake and next due come from the wake log and the fixed
//     cadence. Nothing shells out to ask.
//
// ── WHERE THE BODIES ARE ──
//
// This file is the shape. The work is in store.go (the documents, the item log,
// the locks), ledger.go (the daily lines the rails are summed from), inbox.go
// (news for a window that is not open), every.go (the rhythm), tick.go (the
// pass) and watch.go (the operating system's timer).
//
// Every name a caller holds is declared here, with ONE exception the contract
// could not carry: [Watch] is an interface with no way to make one, so watch.go
// adds NewWatch and the WatchOptions it takes. Nothing else outside this file
// is reachable.
