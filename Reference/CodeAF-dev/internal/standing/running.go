// running.go is the one thing about an item that is true of THIS INSTANT and
// therefore cannot live in its document: whether some process, anywhere on this
// machine, has that item in its hands right now.
//
// WHY IT IS A FILE AND NOT A FIELD. A pass runs in whichever of a live window
// or the operating system's timer got to the lock first, and the person is very
// often sitting in a different window from the one doing the work — or in no
// window at all, with `codeaf tick` doing it. So "firing now" is knowledge one
// process has and every other process needs, which on this side of the product
// means a small file: [Store.markRunning] raises it before the pass looks at an
// item, [Store.clearRunning] takes it down when that item's pass ends, and
// [Store.Running] is what a surface asks.
//
// IT IS NOT THE ITEM'S FLOCK. The `<id>.lock` file beside the document orders
// three writers around one temp+rename (store.go) and is held for microseconds;
// it says nothing about what is happening and it is unlocked long before a
// firing finishes. A marker that tried to be both would be a lock nobody could
// take while a two-minute run was in flight.
//
// EVERY MARKER IS DOUBTED. A process that was killed mid-firing cannot take its
// own marker down, and a `●` that breathed forever after a crash would be the
// screen asserting something it cannot derive — the one thing this product's
// surfaces may not do. So a reader believes a marker only while the process
// that wrote it is alive AND the marker is younger than the longest a pass may
// last ([TickWindow]). Anything else is a leftover, and a leftover is a no.
