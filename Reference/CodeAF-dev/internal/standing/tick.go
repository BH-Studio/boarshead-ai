package standing

// tick.go is the pass: the two hundred lines that are the whole of the ambient
// side's behaviour. Everything else in this package is storage for it.
//
// ONE PASS IS: take the lock or go away, walk the active items, decide which
// ones the world has something to say about, spend within the rails, and write
// one line saying it happened. It is called every five minutes by whichever of
// a live window or the operating system's timer gets there first, and the two
// run exactly the same code.
//
// THE ORDER OF THE RAILS IS THE ORDER OF THE CONSEQUENCES. Expiry first, since
// a dead item should not be looked at, let alone paid for. Then the item's own
// daily count, then the whole day's spending — both BEFORE the probe, because a
// probe costs money and an item that could not fire if it wanted to has no
// business buying evidence.
//
// NOTHING HERE BLOCKS ON A PERSON, and one item's bad day never ends the pass:
// a failure is counted, noted, written onto that item, and the walk goes on.
