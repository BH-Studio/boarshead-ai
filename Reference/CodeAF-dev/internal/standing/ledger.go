// ledger.go is how the rails are told the truth. One append-only file per local
// day, one line per firing and per sentinel call that cost money, and the two
// questions the ticker asks — how many times has this item fired today, and how
// much has everything standing spent today — are sums over that day's file.
//
// APPEND-ONLY IS WHY IT IS SAFE. Three processes may fire in the same second;
// a short O_APPEND write on a local filesystem is atomic, so the worst race is
// two firings passing the rail together, an overspend bounded by one firing's
// own cap. A read-modify-write of a running total would have no such floor.

// ledgerReach is how far back [Store.RunsSince] will walk, in days. It is a

// eight files, and a caller asking for the beginning of time opens this many
// and answers about them. Without it a stray zero moment would open one file
// per day since 1970 on a screen's own refresh.
//
// A month is the widest window any surface asks about today (a card says `this
// week`), with room for one that asks about a longer one.

// rather than one item's figure. The ledger is one file per local day, so a
// surface asking item by item would open the same seven files once per item on
// every card it draws; here they are read once and the caller sums whichever
// ids its subject owns.
//
// A day with no file is a day on which nothing fired, which is not a failure —

// cannot be read at all IS reported, because a total silently missing a day is
