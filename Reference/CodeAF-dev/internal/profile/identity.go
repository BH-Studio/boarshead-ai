// The profile file was the only consumer of a model name in the tree that did
// not resolve it, and it is the one where the cost compounds.
//
// The doctrine is stated at internal/provider/wire.go: "~x and x are one model".
// Every other reader honours it — the adapter memoises quirks under a normalised
// key, the catalog resolves aliases, the wire translates a spelling before it
// leaves the process. The ruler keyed its file on slug(whatever the
// operator typed), so two spellings of one model accumulated two histories and
// two rulers: measured, medians of 13,223 and 44,704 tokens for the same model
// on the same machine, each of them a real average of half the evidence, and the
// planner sized against whichever half the day's spelling happened to open.
//
// The resolution is injected rather than imported. profile sits below the
// catalog in every other respect and importing it here to answer one question
// would drag a network-backed discovery service into a package whose whole job
// is reading a small JSON file. So a surface that has a catalog installs its
// answer once, and a surface that has none keeps the normalisation alone — which
// is exactly what every caller had before this existed.

// Resolve turns one spelling of a model into the identity its history is kept
// under. It must be pure, cheap and non-blocking: it is called on the launch
// path, and a resolver that waited on a fetch would put that fetch in front of
// the first frame of a run.

// at launch, by the surface that owns the catalog.

// gets one consistent answer from that point on; what was written under the

// own normalisation — the leading "~" is codeaf's routing marker and not part of
// any slug, and case is not an identity — which is what a surface with no catalog
// gets. The second is whatever resolver was installed, applied over the first.
//
// The answer is memoised per spelling for the life of the process, because the
// installed resolver reads a catalog that warms in the background: asked before
// it lands and again after, it would honestly give two answers, and a file key
// that moved halfway through a run would split a history inside one process
// rather than across two. First answer wins; the merge in Load is what makes an
// early, unresolved answer cost nothing but a merge later.

// its own is already the one history; a resolved identity with no file is either
// a model nobody has run — where the glob finds nothing and costs a directory
// listing — or a model whose evidence is sitting under a name that resolves to
// it, which is the case this exists for. Merging is by timestamp and bounded by
// maxRecords, exactly as Add bounds the file, so an adoption cannot make a
// profile larger than a profile is allowed to be.
//
// It reads and never writes. The merged records materialise into the resolved
// file the first time somebody Saves one, which keeps Load a read — a listing
// view must not have side effects on disk — and keeps the operation idempotent:
// the sources are never mutated, so running it again produces the same answer.
