// Model words, never provider ids (5.10). "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
// is provenance; "claude-sonnet-4" is what a person says out loud, and a row
// that spent eleven cells on a vendor prefix would be spending them on the one
// part of the string nobody reads.
//
// The rule is ported from the v1 surface (internal/tui/view.go's modelShort) so
// the two surfaces call the same model the same thing during the overlap, and
// it is deliberately conservative: it removes only the four things that are
// provably provenance and never tries to prettify a name it does not recognize.
// An unrecognized slug comes back whole, which is the honest failure — a word
// the reader can still match against a provider's own documentation.

// effortWords is the closed set of reasoning-effort words a slug may carry, in
// the vocabulary internal/provider already speaks ([provider.Effort]). It is a
// closed list because an open one would read "claude-sonnet-4:free" as an
// effort of "free" and put a lie on the row.

// Four things come off, and nothing else does:
//
//	the vendor prefix   "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4" → "claude-sonnet-4"
//	the alias marker    OpenRouter's leading "~"
//	the variant suffix  ":free", ":high" — including the effort words, which
//	                    a caller can render separately (see [Effort])
//	the date suffix     a trailing "-YYYY-MM-DD", which is a release stamp
//	the alias suffix    a trailing "-latest", which is a POINTER at a release
//	                    rather than the name of one — the same kind of fact as
//	                    the date it stands in for, and the exact string a reader
//	                    met on the live build as `deepseek-v4-flash-latest`

// placeholder chosen here would be a fact invented three layers from anyone who
