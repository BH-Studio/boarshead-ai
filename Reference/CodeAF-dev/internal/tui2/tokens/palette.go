	// changes here" looks like when the change is allowed to be quiet.
	//
	// WHY TWO AND WHY THESE TWO. The input row sits one shade LIGHTER than the
	// bar row, which is the whole depth cue: the row you type into is nearer,
	// the row that names where you are is further back, and neither needs a
	// hairline to say so (16's SURFACE SEAMS ARE GROUNDS, and its ban on a third
	// ruled line). The numbers are bounded on three sides at once — the pair has
	// to stay under the sheet (0.45), has to clear [HugSeparationMin] from each
	// other, and has to survive the xterm greyscale ramp, which holds exactly one
	// step between the ground's entry (233) and the band's (235). 0.10 resolves
	// to 233 and 0.40 to 234, so the two-tone is real at 256 colours as well as

	// says nothing else may wear that treatment. These are the planes the two
	// card states stand on; without them the card would be carried by its edge
	// alone.
	//
	// WHY TWO. A task in the conversation has two states a reader must tell
	// apart at a glance — the one just made, and the one that came back — and
	// §16 says the way to separate them is a ground shift rather than a rule.
	// So the commitment card gets its own quieter rung and the delivery card
	// gets the louder one, and the STEP between them is what says "this
	// finished". The treatment stays unique because only the delivery wears the
	// edge as well: at NoColor, where neither ground is drawn at all, the `▎` is
	// still the only thing on screen that says "a finished answer".
	//
	// The numbers are bounded on three sides, exactly as the hug's are. The
	// delivered rung stays UNDER [BandSeparationMin] (1.1424 against a 1.15
	// floor), because a card raised as far as a selection is the slab §16
	// refuses and there would be nowhere left for a band drawn on top of it. The
	// pair clears [SheetSeparationMin] from each other (1.0914), so the step is
	// a step and not a rounding. And the two land on different xterm greyscale
	// entries, which is the tight one: the ramp holds a single step between the
	// ground's entry (233) and the band's (235), so a working rung authored much

// Legal states the composition law. There are exactly three rules, and each

//
//  1. A surface token is never a foreground, and a non-surface token is never a
//     ground. Backgrounds and text are different vocabularies.
//  2. A focused foreground may sit on the ground, on the [Sheet], on the plain
//     band, or on any identity-tinted band. Every combination is drawn in
//     practice — any tier of text can land on a selected rail row, and the
//     whole grey ramp lands on a dialog's own ground — and all are gated.
//  3. A DIMMED foreground may sit only on the ground. This is the design law
//     that keeps the dim state honest: an unfocused pane draws no selection
//     band at all — it marks its selection with the dim identity accent rail
//     ▎ (5.21) — because a band is a focus artifact, and a dimmed pastel on a
//     raised background is the one combination in this palette that cannot
//     clear its gate. Forbidding it is cheaper and truer than brightening
//     every dim value until an invisible pane stops being invisible.
