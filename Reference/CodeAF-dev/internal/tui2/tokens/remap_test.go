// The remap seam (10.2.7, 12.4.4).
//
// internal/sanitize landed the remap MECHANISM in Wave 1 with an identity
// table, and this package supplies the palette that replaces it. The tests
// below run the real sanitizer with the real table, because a [16]int that
// merely looks right is not a seam — the thing worth proving is that the
// conversion compiles, that the sanitizer accepts it, and that tool output
// actually comes out recoloured.
//
// This file is the only place tokens touches internal/sanitize, and it does so
// in a test: the shipping package exports a plain [16]int precisely so it stays
// free of that dependency, and the call site does the conversion.

// TestTableShapeMatchesTheSanitizer is the compile-time half of the seam. If
// sanitize.Table ever changes shape, this file stops building and the assembly
// wave finds out here rather than at wiring time.
