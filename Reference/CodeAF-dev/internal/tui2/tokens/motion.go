import "time"

// The motion vocabulary (11, 18): ONE cadence, three motions, and the exact
// keyframes of each.
//
// 11 permits exactly three moving things product-wide — the braille spinner on
// a running row, the slow breathe on `planning…`, and the composer's cursor —
// and says nothing else animates. That law is about WHAT moves. This file is
// about HOW: the interval every animated cell shares, the frame list each
// motion cycles, and the period one full cycle takes. It exists because those
// numbers were previously scattered as bare literals (a 120ms here, an
// `8 * DefaultInterval` there) and a scattered number is a number nobody can
// tune, review, or hold two surfaces to.
//
// The rule for anything added below: a motion is a NAME, a FRAME LIST, a
// PERIOD, and a sentence saying where it is legal. A frame list with no period
// is a spinner somebody will drive at whatever rate their surface happens to
// repaint at, which is the failure this file ends.

// MotionInterval is THE house animation step: every animated cell in the
// product advances on this grid and no surface may pick its own.
//
// 120ms, and the band around it is narrow for measured reasons at both ends.
// Below about 100ms a braille cycle stops reading as rotation and starts
// reading as noise — the eye cannot resolve ten distinct frames a second, so
// the row shimmers rather than turns — and every step is a repaint of every
// live row, so the cost is paid in wakeups the user cannot even see. Above
// about 150ms the same cycle visibly steps: a ten-frame spinner at 160ms takes
// 1.6s to come round and each frame is long enough to be read as a separate
// glyph rather than as one turning thing. 120ms puts the full braille rotation
// at [SpinnerPeriod] = 1.2s, which is the calm end of the legible band.
//
// It is also the grid the phase-lock is built on: a frame is
// floor(now/interval) % frames, so two rows given the same latched instant show
// the same frame, and a repaint landing inside one step produces byte-identical
// rows and therefore zero dirty rows (8.1.3). A second interval anywhere in the
// product breaks both properties at once — the rows drift apart AND the shell
// starts waking on two schedules.
const MotionInterval = 120 * time.Millisecond

// MotionIntervalMin and MotionIntervalMax are the band [MotionInterval] must
// stay inside, with the reasons stated at MotionInterval. They are here so a
// future tuning is a review of two numbers rather than a rediscovery of why
// 60ms felt frantic.
const (
	MotionIntervalMin = 100 * time.Millisecond
	MotionIntervalMax = 150 * time.Millisecond
)

// MotionPeriodMin and MotionPeriodMax bound one full cycle of any motion in the
// table. Under 0.8s a cycle reads as urgency — a thing that wants something
// from you — which is amber's job and not a spinner's (see [Amber]); over 2s
// the motion stops answering "is this alive?" within the glance that asked.
const (
	MotionPeriodMin = 800 * time.Millisecond
	MotionPeriodMax = 2 * time.Second
)

// SpinnerPeriod is one full rotation of [SpinnerFrames] at the house cadence:
// ten braille frames × 120ms = 1.2s. It is DERIVED rather than authored, so
// adding or removing a frame moves the period instead of silently changing
// what "one rotation" means. len() of an array is a Go constant, so this costs
// nothing at runtime.
const SpinnerPeriod = time.Duration(len(SpinnerFrames)) * MotionInterval

// PulseFrames is the breathe: the three-tier dot the `planning…` line wears
// while the model is thinking, up and back down.
//
// The set is a SIZE ramp on one shape, not four different marks. That is the
// whole design: a growing and shrinking dot reads as breathing, while four
// distinct glyphs read as a second spinner, and 11 already spent its spinner.
// The cycle is written out rather than mirrored in code (·, •, ●, • rather than
// three frames walked forward and back) because the eased dwell indexes a flat
// list, and a list that says exactly what is drawn is a list a designer can read.
//
// BYTE COLLISIONS, DELIBERATE: `·` is also [GlyphSeparator] and
// [GlyphProseBullet]; `●` is also [GlyphStepDone]. The glyph lane ruled the
// collisions acceptable — a slot is a meaning and not a byte, and these three
// are the honest small/medium/large dots in a repertoire every terminal has —
// so they are named here as their own slots and walked by the width gate under
// their own names (see [Glyphs]).
//
// WIDTH: all three are East_Asian_Width=Ambiguous, which is the property that
// matters. Not "all narrow" — all THE SAME, together, under both rulers, so the
// row cannot change width mid-breath under a CJK locale the way 5.21's ◐◓◑◒
// spinner would have. glyph_test.go's TestAnimatedSetsAgreeOnWidth measures it.

// PulseSteps is the breathe's period measured in house steps, and
// [PulsePeriod] is the same number as a duration: 12 × 120ms = 1.44s per full
// breath.
//
// TUNED FROM 8 STEPS (960ms). At 960ms the dot cycled just under once a second,
// which is a resting heart rate — fast enough that a `planning…` line read as
// impatient, and close enough to the spinner's 1.2s rotation that the two
// motions beat against each other on a screen showing both. 1.44s is a slow
// breath, it is audibly not the spinner's period, and it sits inside
// [MotionPeriodMin]..[MotionPeriodMax]. 12 is also 4 frames × 3 steps, so each
// frame gets whole steps at flat easing and the eased version has room to
// linger without any frame being skipped outright.

// PulseEase is how strongly the breathe's dwell bends: 0 is a flat tick, and
// 0.6 dwells roughly 2.5× longer mid-cycle than at the edges. It is what makes
// the dot BREATHE rather than count — a flat four-frame cycle at any period is
// a clock, and the thing being said here is "someone is thinking", not "3.6
// seconds have passed". The value remains part of the table so its meaning is
// readable beside the frames it shapes.

// CaretMotion names 11's third motion so the table is complete, and records

// terminal through DECSCUSR and blinks at whatever rate the user's terminal
// (and their own preference) says; the shell's only jobs are to ask for it and
// to restore the user's cursor on exit. There is deliberately no interval here
// to tune: a caret we drew ourselves would be a fourth animation competing with
// the terminal's own, and it would keep blinking in a frozen render.
