// The vocabulary gates: one table, one meaning per glyph, one cell per glyph in
// every tier, and no consumer spelling a mark the table already owns.
//
// glyph_test.go measures the 5.17 floor and glyphset_test.go measures the
// tier's own data. This file measures the two claims that only make sense
// across BOTH at once — that a slot costs the same in either tier, and that no
// two slots say the same thing — plus the one claim that lives outside this
// package entirely: that the packages holding the table's authority actually
// draw from it.

// TestEveryBindingMeasuresOneCellInBothTiers is the width sweep over the WHOLE
// table rather than over each tier's own walk.
//
// GlyphsIn already measures each side separately, and TestTierWidthParity
// measures composed SAMPLE LINES. Neither states the per-slot claim the tier's
// governing invariant actually makes: flipping the tier must not move a column,
// which is a fact about one slot at a time. A binding whose two sides disagreed
// by a cell would pass both existing gates as long as no sample line happened
// to carry it.
