//
// ── WHY THIS SEAM EXISTS: ONE SURFACE, ONE BODY WHITE ──
//
// internal/tui3 authors its own quieter palette and then renders a model's
// markdown through internal/tui2/prose, which is the only markdown renderer in
// the tree and deliberately resolves every colour on the row from this package
// (prose's own package comment says why it will not seat a second colour
// authority). The consequence was two whites on one screen: prose painted the
// reply's body at [TextPrimary] #E6E6F0 while everything tui3 drew around it
// wore tui3's own, dimmer ink. The brightest thing on the surface was therefore
// the thing a person reads most — about 14:1 against a dark terminal where the
// accent beside it sat at 9.6:1 — which is glare, and halation that makes the
// strokes read heavier than they are.
//
// The fix is not a second renderer and not a copy of the ramp. It is that the
// COLOUR AUTHORITY a caller hands prose may be asked to say the body tier in the
// caller's own voice. One Styler, one answer to "which white", and the ladder's
// shape untouched: an h1 is still the top of the grey ramp and still bold, an h3
// still steps down through [Demote], a fenced block still lands on the code ramp
// and an inline span still stands on the [Sheet]. What moves is the VALUE at the
// top of the ramp, so everything standing on it moves together — which is the
// point, because a tier the body alone left behind would simply relocate the
// glare onto the headings.
//
// A Styler built by [NewStyler] or [NewStylerIn] carries no override, so every
// construction site in this tree keeps rendering exactly the bytes it rendered.
//
// ── WHAT IT COSTS PER PROFILE ──
//
// The override is a COLOUR, so it exists only where the profile has colours to
// spend. [TrueColor] takes it exactly. [ANSI256] takes its nearest cube-or-grey
// neighbour, computed here by the same [nearest256] this package's own table is
// built with — a caller whose palette rounded the same hex to a different index
// would be two whites again on the majority profile, and one resolver is what
// stops that. [ANSI16] and [NoColor] take NOTHING and fall back to the token:
// the sixteen are the user's own theme, so there is no honest form for an
// authored hex there (the wall [Token.UnderlineColor] meets from the other
// side), and a profile told to write no SGR at all writes none.
//
// The DIMMED variant is derived rather than asked for, by the one rule the whole
// palette is dimmed with ([DimTowardGround]). A caller states the colour it
// reads at; an unfocused pane then recedes by the same law every other token
// obeys, instead of staying at full strength because nobody thought about it.
//
// CONTRAST IS THE CALLER'S TO JUSTIFY. contrast_test.go gates [Pairings], and a
// colour that is not in the table is not in that walk — so the caller who states
// one owes it the check its own palette owes. internal/tui3 pins its body ink
// with a contrast law of its own for exactly this reason.
