package tokens

// The state axis (8.1.6) and the hue vocabulary (5.16), and the one function
// that composes them into a [Token].
//
// Three axes exist in this package and they are orthogonal:
//
//   - HUE — what a cell MEANS. Five words, no more.
//   - STATE — how LIVE the cell is: accent = live, plain = settled, dim =
//     chrome. 8.1.6's law, and the reason a long-lived row changes colour
//     rather than shape.
//   - FOCUS — whether the PANE owning the row has the user's attention. A
//     property of the pane, never of the datum; see [Focus].
//
// [ResolveToken] is the whole composition rule, in one place, so no renderer
// ever gets to invent a fourth axis.

// Hue is the five-word colour vocabulary of 5.16. Everything not carrying a hue
// is the three-tier grey ramp of 5.13.
//
// The ordinals keep the vocabulary compact and stable inside this package; the
// composition rule below is the only door that interprets them.
type Hue uint8

	// HueAttention (soft amber) means a human is needed: question badges,
	// waiting states, the context meter past its warn point.

	// thinking pulse.
	HueAlive
	// HueMoney (soft green) means money and success: cost figures, settled ✓.
	HueMoney
	// HueBroken (soft coral) means failed or cancelled.

	// HueIdentity is the per-task pastel. It is NOT one colour: the actual
	// pastel comes from an identity chosen from the eight-token wheel. Resolving
	// it without a chosen identity yields the first wheel entry, which is a

// ResolveToken composes the hue and state axes into the one token a cell draws
// with. It is the ONLY place the composition rule lives, and the rule is three
// lines long on purpose:
//
//  1. A HUE ALWAYS WINS. A cell that means something keeps meaning it after the
//     row settles — 5.16's green settled ✓ and coral ✕ are settled cells that
//     are still coloured. 8.1.6's "completion settles accent → plain text"
//     governs the row's PROSE, which carries no hue; the glyph beside it does.
//  2. With no hue, the state axis picks the tier: live is cyan, because cyan is
//     the word for alive (5.16) and "accent = live" has to resolve to some
//     accent; settled is the primary grey; chrome is the tertiary grey.
//  3. The SECONDARY tier is never reached from here. A status line is secondary
//     because of WHAT IT IS (5.13's type hierarchy), not because of how live it
//     is — a renderer names [TextSecondary] directly. Deriving it from the
//     state axis would make two different questions share one answer.
//
// It is a pure switch over two small enums: no allocation, no table lookup, and
// nothing for the compiler to fail to inline.

//
// Two callers, and both are the same idea — a thing that normally recedes has
// briefly earned the eye:
//
//   - 5.22: a chrome control that is also a button brightens one tier on focus,
