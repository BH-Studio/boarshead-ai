// Package reltime is the one relative-time formatter in the product.
//
// THE LAW IT HOLDS: time is RELATIVE everywhere, and absolute only inside an
// expanded record. A transcript row, a rail card, a receipt, a status line and
// a home all answer "when" with "now", "12s", "5m", "2h", "yesterday", "mon",
// "aug 3" — because the question a reader is actually asking of a running
// system is "how stale is this", and a wall-clock stamp makes them do the
// subtraction. The exact instant is what you get when you OPEN the record: an
// expanded task page, a trace row, a journal dump. Those are the only places an
// absolute stamp belongs, and they do not come through here.
//
// It exists as its own package for the reason 8.1.5 gives the header grammar:
// a vocabulary with two implementations is two vocabularies. Four surfaces were
// each one `fmt.Sprintf` away from inventing their own ladder, and a product
// that says "5m" in the rail and "5 minutes ago" in the transcript is a product
// with two clocks.
//
// It is pure: two functions of their arguments, no ambient `time.Now`, no
// state, and no dependency beyond the standard library. `now` is a parameter so
// a frame can latch ONE instant and format every cell in it from that instant.
// Cells derived from separate reads of the clock disagree with each other on
// the frame where the second ticks.
//
// It is NOT the width-stable live cell. `tokens.Elapsed` is that — "45s, 5m,
// 1h02, 99d23", fixed width, no jitter, for a column that re-renders every
// frame (5.21). This package is the READING form: what a sentence, a receipt or
// a settled row says about a time, where the words matter more than the column.
// A caller that needs a fixed column pads what it gets here, or asks tokens.

	// digits change faster than the eye can use them, and "now" is both truer
	// and quieter than a counter nobody is reading.

// Short is the relative reading of an instant: how long ago it was, in the
// fewest characters that stay honest.
//
// The ladder, in order:
//
//	now         under ten seconds, and anything in the future (see below)
//	12s         under a minute
//	5m          under an hour
//	2h          under a day
//	yesterday   the calendar day before now's
//	mon         within the last week
//	aug 3       older, in now's year
//	aug 3 2025  older still, in another year
//
// Each rung TRUNCATES rather than rounds, so a reading never claims more time
// has passed than actually has: 119 seconds is "1m", not "2m". A row that
// overstates its own staleness is the one direction of error that makes a
// reader distrust a live surface.
//
// THE FUTURE READS AS "now", deliberately. Clock skew is real — a journal row
// stamped by another machine, a database default, a laptop that just woke — and
// the honest rendering of "this happened a moment ago according to a clock that
// is not quite yours" is "now", never "-3s", which is a number no reader has a
// use for.
//
// A ZERO TIME RETURNS "", because a time that was never set is missing data and
// not a moment zero seconds ago. Rendering it as "now" would be exactly the
// invented number 8.2.20 forbids; the caller draws the missing glyph over an
// empty reading, as it does for a missing cost.
//
// The calendar rungs are read in now's LOCATION: "yesterday" means yesterday
// where the reader is sitting, not where the timestamp was written.
