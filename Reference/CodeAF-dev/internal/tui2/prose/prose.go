// DefaultMeasure is the reading length prose wraps to when a caller states no
// other. It is the low end of the classic typographic measure — 45 to 90
// characters a line, past which the eye loses the return sweep — and it is a
// CEILING rather than a target: a 60-column terminal wraps at 60.
//
// The number is here rather than in tokens because it is a property of reading,
// not of the shared palette: it describes how long a sentence may be inside a
// pane.
const DefaultMeasure = 88

// Options is everything a render depends on. It is a value, and [Render] is a
// pure function of it and the source: the same source at the same width through
// the same Styler produces the same bytes, every time, which is what lets a
// caller cache rows per (width, version) the way the block engine already does.
type Options struct {
	// Width is the hard ceiling in printable cells. EVERY row [Render] returns
	// is at most this wide — not usually, not for well-formed input, always.
	// A Width below 1 is clamped to 1.
	Width int
	// Measure is the reading length paragraphs, headings, lists, quotes and
	// rules wrap to, clamped to Width. Zero means [DefaultMeasure]; a caller
	// that genuinely wants prose to fill the pane sets Measure equal to Width.
	//
	// Tables and code blocks ignore it and take the full Width, because a
	// figure is looked at rather than read along: narrowing a table to a
	// sentence's length is how a table becomes soup.
	//
	// AND SO DOES A TOKEN THAT CANNOT BE BROKEN — a URL, a path, a hash. It is
	// given the whole Width before it is cut, for the same reason and on the same
	// terms ([wrapper.commit]): a link is copied rather than read along, and a
	// link broken at the measure while the column stood half empty was a link
	// that did not work.
	Measure int
	// Styler paints every cell. Nil renders unpainted text — the honest
	// headless default, and exactly what a NoColor profile would draw anyway.

	// mark supplied by the caller and must therefore stay off the raised plane.
	// Nil means every inline code span uses prose's ordinary plane.

// token layer's ANSI-16 remap (12.4.4).

// Prose then goes one step further than any of them and strips what survives.
// The remap exists so someone else's colours COHERE with ours; here there is
// nothing for them to cohere with, because this package resolves every colour
// on the row itself from the markdown structure. A reply that arrived carrying
// its own SGR would otherwise get to paint a heading, and the surface's own
// hierarchy would be one model's whim away from meaning nothing.

// escapes it recognizes. The strip is the second, narrower step.
