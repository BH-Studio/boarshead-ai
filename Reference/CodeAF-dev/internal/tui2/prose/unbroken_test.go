// The measure is the length a SENTENCE is read at, and a bare URL or a path is
// not a sentence. Breaking one at the measure did two wrong things at once: it
// broke a token that must not be broken, and it broke it early — at 160 columns
// the answer column is 130 cells and the measure is 88, so a link that would
// have fitted whole came out as `…&st` / `ream=true…` with forty columns of the
// frame standing empty beside it, and nothing on the row saying whether the
// break was the renderer's or the model's.
