// Fenced code.
//
// chroma does the lexing and OUR style does the colour. The two are joined the
// only way that keeps both honest: [codeStyle] is a real chroma style built
// from the ramp in internal/tui2/tokens, chroma's own inheritance decides which
// of the six pastels a lexer token inherits, and the answer is then read back
// as a [tokens.CodeSlot] so the token layer — not chroma's terminal formatter —
// decides how that pastel degrades. chroma never writes a byte to the screen.
//
// That indirection is worth one map: chroma knows roughly two hundred token
// types and how they relate, and re-deriving that relationship as a switch here
// would be a second, worse copy of a table someone else maintains.

// codeStyle is the ramp expressed as a chroma style. Only the seven colours the
// ramp declares appear on the right-hand side — there is no eighth colour in
// this file, and [slotFor] would not know what to do with one.
