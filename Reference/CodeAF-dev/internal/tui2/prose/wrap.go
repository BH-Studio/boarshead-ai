// Wrapping styled text.
//
// Prose has to wrap a SEQUENCE OF STYLED RUNS because a sentence can change
// style in the middle of a word — `**re**factor` is one word and two styles,
// and breaking it at the style boundary would put a line ending in "re" on
// screen. So the unit here is the word, a word is a []piece, and the wrapper
// only ever looks at style to decide what the separating space should be
// painted as.
//
// The algorithm is greedy because that is the only rule under which appending
// text cannot rewrite an earlier row,
// which is what makes a streaming reply cheap to redraw. This package does not
// stream today — it renders a whole document — but a wrapper that could not
// stream would be the thing standing in the way when it does.

// wrapper accumulates pieces and emits finished rows through emit.
//
// IT HAS TWO WIDTHS AND THEY ANSWER DIFFERENT QUESTIONS. width is the READING
// MEASURE — how long a sentence may be before the eye loses the return sweep
// ([Options.Measure]) — and ceiling is the COLUMN the rows are actually drawn
// in ([Options.Width]). Every row of prose is wrapped to the measure; the one
// thing allowed past it is a token that cannot be broken without being
// falsified, which may take the whole column before it is cut.

	// A WORD TOO LONG FOR THE MEASURE IS GIVEN THE WHOLE COLUMN BEFORE IT IS
	// BROKEN, and the word this is about is a URL or a path.
	//
	// THE DEFECT: the measure is a length SENTENCES are read at, and a bare link
	// is not a sentence — nobody reads along it, they copy it. Breaking it at the
	// measure did two wrong things at once. It broke a token that must not be
	// broken, and it broke it EARLY: at 160 columns the answer column is 130
	// cells wide, the measure is 88, and a link that would have fitted whole
	// came out as `…&st` / `ream=true…` with forty columns of the frame standing
	// empty beside it. A link cut in half is a link that does not work, and the
	// reader has no way to tell whether the break was the renderer's or the
	// model's.
	//
	// THE CEILING IS STILL A CEILING. A token longer than the column is broken at
	// the column, exactly as before — no row this package returns has ever been
	// wider than [Options.Width] and none is now. What moved is only where the
	// break falls when there is room to spare, and that a token which fits the
	// column is left whole on a row of its own.
