// Package sanitize is the one output chokepoint for terminal-unsafe text
// (the August 2026 chat-rebuild audit, no longer in the tree, Part 10.2 items 6-7).
//
// Anything that reaches the terminal and was not authored by our own
// renderer — a model reply, a tool result, a worker trace line — is a
// channel someone else's bytes can drive. Escape sequences are how a
// terminal emulator is remote-controlled: OSC 52 writes the system
// clipboard, OSC 0/1/2 rewrite the window/tab title, OSC 8 can point a
// clickable span at an arbitrary URL, and the DCS/APC/PM/SOS string types
// exist for the same reason CSI does — to make the emulator DO something,
// not print something. Sanitize.Text (and its palette-remapping sibling,
// TextWithPalette) is the single place that content gets to cross from
// "somebody else's bytes" to "safe to draw."
//
// # What survives (the allowlist)
//
//   - plain text, including all valid UTF-8 beyond ASCII
//   - '\n' and '\t'
//   - SGR sequences: CSI parameter-string 'm' (ESC '[' ... 'm'), the color
//     and style codes lipgloss/our renderers already emit. Nothing else
//     introduced by ESC survives — cursor movement, screen/line erase,
//     mode-setting, and every other CSI final byte are stripped, along with
//     both 2- and 3-byte ESC forms (ESC 'c', ESC '(' 'B', ...).
//
// # What is neutralized
//
// OSC of any kind (52 clipboard, 0/1/2 title, 8 hyperlink, 7/9/133/777/99
// and anything unrecognized — the list is not an allowlist, so a new OSC
// number needs no code change here), DCS/APC/PM/SOS strings, every C1
// control byte (0x80-0x9F, both as a raw byte and via the classic
// ESC-prefixed 7-bit forms), and any C0 control other than '\n'/'\t'.
// Malformed input (a truncated OSC, a lone trailing ESC, an escape nested
// inside another escape's payload, invalid UTF-8) is consumed defensively
// and never panics — see the fuzz corpus in sanitize_test.go, written after
// this codebase's escape-blind-truncate incident (internal/tui's
// ANSI-aware truncate/wrapText).
//
// # OSC 8 policy
//
// The product itself adopts OSC 8 hyperlinks (audit notes 5.21) — the
// threat is not the sequence, it's letting UNTRUSTED text mint one. So OSC
// 8 arriving inside model/tool/trace output is stripped like any other
// OSC, leaving the visible link text behind; our own renderer is the only
// thing allowed to wrap a span in a real OSC 8 link, and it does so after
// this chokepoint, from our own chrome strings, never from sanitized
// content.
//
// # Palette remap (10.2.7)
//
// TextWithPalette additionally remaps raw ANSI-16 SGR color codes (the
// classic 30-37/40-47/90-97/100-107 families) through a caller-supplied
// Table, so a tool's own colors cohere with ours instead of clashing with
// whatever the token layer eventually defines (Wave 2). The mechanism
// lands now; Identity is the only table anyone plugs in until then, and
// calling with Identity is a single 16-int array compare — no extra
// allocation, no second pass over the text.

// E2 80 94 — the 0x80 is a continuation byte, not a control) is the common
// case that would trip a byte-blind check — it is just part of the
// character. A version of this scan that checked raw bytes without rune
// awareness was caught exactly this way: it silently sent ordinary text
// containing accented letters, em dashes, or emoji down the slow path on
// every call, which produced correct output (render's own scan is
// rune-aware) but defeated the fast path's entire purpose for a very
