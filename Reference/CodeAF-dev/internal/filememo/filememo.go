// Package filememo is the one answer to "a file read at most once per change".
//
// THE SHAPE IT EXISTS FOR. A great many facts this program needs on the path of
// a keystroke or a turn live in a small file that almost never changes: the
// profile's config.json, which is read to answer whether a key is configured on
// EVERY Enter and whether this is the first prompt on EVERY turn; a project's
// AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md, re-read whenever the system prompt's clock goes
// stale, which is precisely the came-back-from-lunch turn a person is already
// waiting on. Each of those was an os.ReadFile and a parse per call, and each
// was written separately because none of them looked expensive on its own.
//
// So there is ONE mechanism, and every one of those callers uses it: a [Memo]
// holds the derived value beside the reading of the file it came from, and
// spends one stat to decide whether it may answer. A stat is a syscall against a
// page the kernel has cached; a read-and-parse is the file's bytes through
// encoding/json and an allocation per key.
//
// WHAT MAKES AN ANSWER STALE, stated plainly because a memo that is wrong about
// this is worse than no memo at all:
//
//   - The file's modification time or its size differs from the reading the held
//     value came from. That is every ordinary write, including every write
//     through an atomic create-temp-and-rename, which lands a file with a fresh
//     mtime and usually a fresh size.
//   - The file appearing where there was none, or disappearing. Absence is a
//     value like any other and is held like one, so a profile with no config.json
//     — the ordinary state of a fresh install — is answered without a read too.
//   - A caller-supplied stamp moving ([Memo.Stamped]). It is how a package whose
//     own writer runs in this process says "that was me": config's every
//     persisted write bumps a counter, and reading that counter into the
//     freshness key means this process can never serve its own stale write, on
//     any filesystem, whatever its timestamp granularity.
//
// AND WHAT IT DOES NOT SEE: a file rewritten by ANOTHER process to the same size
// within one tick of the filesystem's timestamp resolution. On every filesystem
// this program runs on that tick is a nanosecond. It is written down here rather
// than guarded against, because guarding against it means reading the file.
//
// IT IS NOT THE SURFACE'S OWN HOLDER, and the difference is the contract rather
// than the code. The surface keeps a thing of the same family for what it draws
// with, and that one is refreshed by the frame's beat from a single goroutine
// and never stats anything on the path — it answers with whatever the last beat
// left, because a frame that blocks is a frame dropped. This one is the
// opposite bargain: it stats on every read, from any goroutine, and is therefore
// never behind the disk by more than a write that has not finished. A caller who
// can afford to be one beat stale wants that one; a caller who must not serve a
// setting the person just changed wants this one.
