// key once, it is written to the same file beside everything else, and it is
// exactly as good tomorrow as it was today. What differs between one such
// service and the next is one small fact — where the key rides on a request —
// and that fact comes from the catalog (catalog.go), not from code written per
// service.
//
// THE PACKAGE STILL NEVER LOGS A KEY. It is written to the store file and put
// on outgoing requests, and it appears in no error, no answer and no line of
// text this file builds.
