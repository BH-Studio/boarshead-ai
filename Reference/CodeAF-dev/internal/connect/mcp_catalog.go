package connect

// The 28 tool servers this build ships, and where each one answers.
//
// ── THIS FILE IS DATA ──
//
// It is kept apart from the machinery for the reason category.go is kept apart
// from catalog.go: a list of facts about other people's products is a thing you
// edit, argue about and regenerate, and none of the code that uses it should
// have to move when a vendor changes an address. Adding another is one entry
// below and nothing else — no switch, no wiring, no screen.
//
// ── EVERY ADDRESS WAS READ OFF THE VENDOR'S OWN PAGE ──
//
// Not off a directory, an aggregator or somebody's blog post: a wrong address
// here is a person sent to sign in to a service that is not the one they asked
// for. Each entry carries the page it was read from and the date it was read.
// An address nobody could confirm from the vendor is not shipped.
//
// ── AND WHY GITHUB IS NOT HERE ──
//
// GitHub runs one of these too, and it is deliberately left out of this wave:
// its sign-in does not let a program introduce itself, so connecting it would
// need an application registered by hand in a console first — which is the one
// thing this half of the package exists to avoid. On 2026-05-27 a maintainer
// closed github/github-mcp-server issue #2532, "Support Dynamic Client
// Registration", saying this introduction will never be implemented on
// GitHub's sign-in server. GitHub therefore comes back only with an application
// registered by hand in a console, in a later wave.
//
// Slack is not a tool server because its hosted tools refuse applications
// outside its Marketplace and it offers no self-registration. It arrives as a
// browser plug instead (slack.go), with an application registered by hand.

// mcpEntry is one line of the list: what goes on a menu, where the service
// answers, and the one fact about that address a person may have to supply.
type mcpEntry struct {
	service Service
	address string
	// blank is the one named piece left open in address. Empty is ordinary.
	blank blank
	// answers is the vendor's closed list of values for blank. It is empty
	// when the address has no blank.
	answers []string
}

// mcpCatalog is the list, in no particular order — [sortPlugs] puts them in the
// order a person reads them.
//
// Each blurb says what connecting buys in the person's own words. It does not
// say how any of it works, and the test beside this file holds that line.
