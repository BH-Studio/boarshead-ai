// What a person's Slack connection can be used for, in two sentences.
//
// ── WHY TWO AND NOT ONE ──
//
// The line is the same line internal/approval draws: reading Slack is not
// posting in somebody's name. A person who wants codeaf to find and read a
// thread without ever speaking as them needs a control that can say exactly
// that. Search, thread reading and channel listing stay together because a
// program allowed to find a message but not open its thread is a distinction
// nobody would choose and a row nobody would set differently from its neighbour.
//
// The phrases are what the person reads, so they use second-person plain verbs.
// "send Slack messages as you" names the fact worth deciding about: what arrives
// at the other end is from them.
