// The tool servers: the services that bring their OWN tools rather than ours.
//
// ── WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THEM, AND WHAT IS NOT ──
//
// Google (google.go) is a service this package knows by heart: codeaf was told
// its addresses, was registered in its console, and every tool it offers —
// searching mail, moving an event — is a function somebody here wrote. The
// catalog (catalog.go) is the opposite extreme: hundreds of services codeaf
// knows nothing about beyond where they answer and where the key goes, with one
// raw call as their whole tool surface.
//
// A tool server sits in neither place. Notion, Linear and the rest now run a
// service of their own whose entire job is to hand a program a LIST OF TOOLS —
// their names, their arguments, what each one does — and to run one when asked.
// So the tools are not written here and not absent either: they are fetched,
// per account, at the moment they are needed. What this file owns is the way in.
//
// THE REST OF THE PROGRAM SEES NOTHING NEW. A tool server is a [Plug] on the one
// registry, it appears in [Manager.Services] as a browser connection like Google,
// it is connected with [Manager.BeginAuth], forgotten with [Manager.Disconnect],
// and its keys live in the one store file beside everybody else's. No screen, no
// settings panel and no menu learns a second kind of service. What is new is two
// methods — [Manager.MCPTools] and [Manager.MCPCall] — and they are new because
// there was previously nothing that could ask a service what it can do.
//
// ── NOBODY REGISTERS ANYTHING FIRST ──
//
// A browser connection normally needs an application registered by hand in the
// vendor's developer console, which is why [Manager.Services] hides a service
// this build holds no client credential for. A tool server needs none: codeaf
// introduces itself to the service at connect time, is issued an identity on the
// spot, and keeps it (mcp_registration.go). That is the whole reason these
// services can be shipped as a list rather than as console visits.
//
// ── THE VOCABULARY ──
//
// A person connects "Notion". They do not connect a protocol, a server or a
// grant, and no string this package puts in front of them says otherwise. The
// machinery has its names in here, where the reader is somebody maintaining it.

// [AuthBrowser] — a person signs in in a browser, which is the only thing that
// word is for — and every screen goes on reading it exactly as it reads Google.

// can tell an entry whose renewal needs a registration (mcp_registration.go)

// ── WHY THIS IS A FUNCTION AND NOT A MAP ──
//
// [RegisterCapabilities] takes a map from tool name to capability, written at
// init from a list somebody typed. A tool server's tools are not knowable at
// init: they are fetched per account, they differ between two people's Notion
// accounts, and the service may add one tomorrow. So the map for these services
// is empty and this is the door instead — the same question, asked of a tool
// rather than of a name.
//
// It is deliberately NOT a [Manager] method: the answer depends on the tool and
// nothing else, so there is nothing for a manager to contribute.

// It is the question a caller arming a belt has to ask, and it cannot be
// answered from [Status] alone: a tool server and Google are both browser
// connections, and what differs is where their tools come from. A service this
// answers yes for is armed from [Manager.MCPTools] and called with
