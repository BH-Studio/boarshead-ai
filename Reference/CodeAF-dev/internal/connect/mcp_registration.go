// RegistrationFileName is the file codeaf's own identity with each tool server
// lives in, named here so that a doctor screen and a "where are my things"
// answer can say the same word the code reads.
//
// ── WHY IT IS NOT credentials.json ──
//
// What is in credentials.json is one person's keys. What is in here is the
// APPLICATION's: the identity a tool server issued to this copy of codeaf when
// it introduced itself, plus the two addresses that sign-in used. For every
// other browser service that identity comes from configuration and is the same
// for everybody running the same build; for these it is minted per machine, so
// it has to be written down somewhere or the next start would ask the vendor for
// a second one and leave the first lying in their console forever.
//
// It is kept at 0600 like the keys and unlike the settings, because a tool
// server may hand back a secret with it.
//
// ── AND WHY IT SURVIVES Disconnect ──
//
// [Manager.Disconnect] is documented as forgetting the person's keys and keeping
// the client credential, so that a service can be reconnected without any
// further setup. This file IS the client credential for these services, so it
// obeys that law by staying: disconnecting Notion and connecting it again is one
// browser trip, not a second registration.

// mcpRegistration is everything a later start needs to go on using a connection
// this build's sign-in made: who codeaf is to that service, where the renewal
// goes, and what the whole thing was bound to.

// service's, in the store file.
