// The word each catalog service is filed under, written down by hand.
//
// ── WHY THIS IS A LIST AND NOT A LOOKUP ──
//
// The catalog (catalog.go) knows where a service answers, how its key rides on
// a request and what it is called, and it knows NOTHING about what it is for:
// the only label it carries is `experimental`. So the one fact a person browsing
// two hundred services actually navigates by — is this a helpdesk or a payment
// processor — has to be written here, once, by somebody who knows.
//
// That makes this file DATA, and it is kept in a file of its own for the reason
// catalog.go is kept away from everything else: a list of facts about other
// people's products is a thing you edit, argue about and regenerate, and the
// code that reads it should never have to move when it changes.
//
// ── THE WORDS ARE A CLOSED LIST ──
//
// Eleven of them, below, and a category outside that list is a mistake caught
// by a test rather than a twelfth heading that appears on somebody's screen
// because a line here was typed in the plural. They are the words a person would
// use — "billing", "calls & meetings" — not a taxonomy: nobody looking for
// Stripe thinks "financial services", and a heading nobody thinks in is a
// heading they read past.
//
// A service is filed under WHAT SOMEBODY OPENS IT FOR, not under what it is
// built on. Aircall and Fireflies are both "calls & meetings" though one is a
// phone system and the other writes notes, because a person reaching for either
// is reaching for the same half hour of their week.
//
// ── AND A WORD OVER ONE ROW IS NOT A CATEGORY ──
//
// There were thirteen words, and two of them stood over a single service each:
// "accounting" over Odoo and "e-commerce" over FastSpring. On the screen that
// browses this list a heading costs a blank line and a word — two lines to
// introduce one row — and a person scanning for a payment processor does not
// look under "e-commerce" for FastSpring or under "accounting" for their books
// unless somebody already told them to. Both now sit under "billing", which is
// this list's word for money and where a person reaching for either of them was
// already going to look. A category is worth its heading at two rows and not at
// one; when a third accounting service arrives the word comes back.
//
// ── AND WHY THERE IS NO "other" HERE ──
//
// Every service the catalog hands us has a word in this file, and a test says
// so. The readers (internal/tui3) file an uncategorized service under "other"
// because a build whose catalog outran this list must still draw something
// honest — but an "other" heading in front of a person is this file being out of
// date, not a category, so nothing here is ever deliberately left blank.

// The eleven words. They are constants so that a line below cannot quietly
// invent a twelfth heading by adding an s.
