package connect

// The capability model: what a person has agreed their accounts may be used
// for, said in their own sentences rather than in tool names.
//
// This is the law for the wiring wave, and it is written HERE rather than as a
// second package comment so that connect.go's — "the accounts layer" — goes on
// being the first thing a reader of the package is told. Two package comments
// are legal and get concatenated in filename order, which would have put the
// capability model ahead of the sentence explaining what the package is.
//
// A connection is one grant — the whole mailbox, the whole calendar — because
// that is the only shape a browser trip has. What a person actually wants to
// decide is finer than that and it is not technical: reading their mail is not
// sending it, and a meeting that lands on somebody else's calendar is not a
// meeting they read about. So each plug declares a handful of CAPABILITIES,
// each one a sentence, and each sentence carries one of three states.
//
// ── THE THREE STATES, FOR THE WIRING WAVE ──
//
// STATE OFF MEANS THE TOOL IS NOT ON THE BELT AND THE CAPABILITY IS ABSENT FROM
// THE SERVICES LISTING. Off is not a refusal at the gate: a refused call costs a
// turn, teaches the model to try again in different words, and puts a question
// in front of somebody who already answered it. A capability that is off is a
// capability the conversation never learns exists.
//
// STATE ASK MEANS THE APPROVAL GATE PROMPTS. The call is armed, the model may
// make it, and the person is asked before it runs — the ordinary consent prompt,
// with the recipient and the subject in it, exactly as internal/approval's floor
// under a blanket allow produces today.
//
// STATE YES MEANS THE NAMED-RULE ALLOW. It is the person saying the sentence
// internal/approval already understands: not the blanket default, which cannot
// vouch for a message it has not seen, but the rule that NAMES the tool. So yes
// on a capability that acts is worth exactly what `gmail_send:allow` is worth,
// and it is worth that because a person wrote it about that capability.
//
// THE MID-CHAT "ALWAYS" ANSWER IS THE SAME SENTENCE, SAID IN A DIFFERENT ROOM.
// When somebody answers "always" to a consent prompt, that answer must land here
// — SetCapabilityState(service, capability, StateYes) — and not in a second
// remembered-allow list of its own. ONE VOCABULARY, ONE STORE: a person who said
// always in a conversation must find that capability set to yes in the panel,
// and a person who sets it to off in the panel must stop being asked in the
// conversation. Two stores would drift the first time somebody used both.
//
// ── WHAT IS NOT DECIDED HERE ──
//
// This file is the model and the memory, and nothing else. It arms no tool,
// prompts nobody, and imports nothing of the surface. The wiring wave reads
// [Manager.ToolCapability] and [Manager.CapabilityState] at the two moments that
// matter — when a family is armed, and when a call is judged — and every law
// above is that wave's to keep.
