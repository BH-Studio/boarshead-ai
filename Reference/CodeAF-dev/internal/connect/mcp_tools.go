// Asking a connected service what it can do, and asking it to do one thing.
//
// ── THE TWO METHODS ARE THE WHOLE SURFACE ──
//
// [Manager.MCPTools] answers with a list a belt can be built from.
// [Manager.MCPCall] runs one and answers with text a model can read. Nothing
// else about the arrangement leaves this package: no session, no connection, no
// vocabulary from somebody else's protocol. A caller that wanted to hold a
// connection open would be holding a thing it cannot renew, cannot reconnect and
// cannot reason about the lifetime of, so it is not offered one.
//
// ── A CONNECTION PER ASK ──
//
// Each call opens a connection, does its one thing and closes it. That is the
// right trade for a program where a person's chat asks for a tool now and again:
// a held-open connection would have to survive sleep, a changed network and a
// renewed key, and it would have to do that in a package whose whole design is
// that a caller holds nothing but a [Manager]. The cost is one round-trip of
// setting up, on top of a call that is already crossing the internet.
//
// WHAT IS NOT PAID TWICE IS THE TOOL LIST. See [Manager.MCPTools].

	// is somebody else's search, not one fetch.

// answer is the same for every call in a sitting, and a belt is rebuilt far more
// often than a service adds a tool. A person who connects a service, uses it,
// and finds a new tool missing has only to start codeaf again — which is a much
// smaller surprise than every turn of a conversation paying for a list that has
// not changed since the one before.
//
// A service that is not connected is an error and not an empty list: a caller
// that got no tools would arm nothing and say nothing, and the person would be
