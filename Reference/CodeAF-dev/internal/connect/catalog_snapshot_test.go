// This file is the proof that replacing the amp-labs import with a committed
// snapshot took nothing away.
//
// ampcatalog's own parity test compares the two catalogs row by row. That is
// necessary and not sufficient: what a person actually sees is not a catalog
// row, it is a plug — an id, a name, a category, a blurb, an address with its
// blank still in it, where the key rides, and the health check. So this test
// builds the whole plug list twice, once from the snapshot the binary ships
// and once from the library at its pinned commit, and requires them to be
// equal in every field including the unexported ones.
//
// The library is imported HERE and nowhere the binary can reach, which is the
// entire arrangement: a test-only dependency costs nothing at runtime and
// nothing in the binary, and it is the only thing that can tell us the copy is
// still true.
