// The sign-in for a service that brings its own tools.
//
// ── IT IS THE SAME TRIP, ARRANGED BY THE SERVICE INSTEAD OF BY US ──
//
// Google's trip (auth.go) is made of facts written down in this package: where
// the sign-in page is, where the exchange goes, who codeaf is. A tool server
// publishes all three, in a shape everybody has agreed on, so the trip is the
// same trip and the difference is only that the first thing codeaf does is ASK:
//
//	1. the service says where the description of its sign-in lives
//	   (RFC 9728 — protected resource metadata),
//	2. that description names the sign-in, which describes itself
//	   (RFC 8414 — authorization server metadata),
//	3. codeaf introduces itself there and is issued an identity
//	   (RFC 7591 — dynamic client registration), kept for next time,
//	4. the browser trip runs with a proof key and the service's own name
//	   attached (PKCE and RFC 8707), on the same loopback addresses and behind
//	   the same page as every other connection this program makes.
//
// The first three steps come from the tool-server SDK's oauthex package, which
// implements those documents and their security checks. What is written here is
// the order they go in, the loopback half of step four, and what is kept
// afterwards.
//
// ── THE ONE HONEST FAILURE ──
//
// A service whose sign-in will not let a program introduce itself cannot be
// connected this way at all, and there is nothing a person can do about it from
// here. That is said in one sentence, in their words, at the moment they ask —
// not as a refusal from somebody else's server three redirects later.

	// trip. They are ordinary web requests to a service that is either up or
