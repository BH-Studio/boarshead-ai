// The registry is the design. Google is one plug and not the point — it is the
// plug that happens to exist today. A service that arrives later declares
// itself from its own file's init, and no caller, no settings screen and no
// line of this file changes. A closed switch over service names would put every
// future vendor's vocabulary in this source and make the package a merge point
// for work that has nothing to do with connecting.
//
// The package imports nothing of the surface — no session, no TUI, no config.
// It is given a profile directory to keep its file in and a map of client
// credentials to sign requests with, both as plain values, so every law here
// can be tested without a real account or a real browser.
//
// THE PACKAGE NEVER OPENS A BROWSER. [Manager.BeginAuth] starts the loopback
// listener and returns the address to visit; whoever owns the screen decides
// how that address reaches the person.
//
// THE PACKAGE NEVER LOGS A KEY. No access key, refresh key or client secret is
// printed, returned in an error, or written anywhere but the store file.
