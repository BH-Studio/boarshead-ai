package connect

// The catalog: a few hundred services codeaf can reach the moment a person
// pastes a key, taken from Ampersand's connectors project.
//
// ── THIS FILE IS THE ONLY PLACE THAT NAME APPEARS ──
//
// Everything past this file sees plugs, [Service] values and plain strings.
// Nothing else in this package, and nothing at all outside it, imports the
// catalog or names one of its types. That is the whole point of a wrapper: the
// catalog is a list of facts about other people's services, and a list of facts
// is a thing you swap — for a newer pin, for a hand-written file, for a
// different project entirely — without touching a line of the code that uses
// it. A catalog type that leaked into a plug interface, a store entry or a tool
// description would make that swap a rewrite.
//
// ── WHAT IS TAKEN AND WHAT IS LEFT ──
//
// Only the services a KEY opens: the ones the catalog marks as taking a key on
// a header or a query parameter, and the ones that take the older name-and-
// password shape. The services that need a trip through a browser are left
// where they are — that trip needs an application registered in somebody's
// developer console first, which is a thing a person does once and deliberately
// (google.go is the one this build ships), not a thing a catalog can hand out.
//
// A service the catalog cannot describe well enough to use is skipped rather
// than half-built: no name to call it by, no address that parses, no rule for
// where the key goes, or more than one blank in its address than one answer can
// fill. Skipping is quiet. A menu that offered a service and then failed at the
// first call would be worse than a menu that never mentioned it.
