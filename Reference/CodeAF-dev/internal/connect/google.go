//
// THE ASK IS THE SMALLEST ONE THAT DOES THE WORK, and each line is one:
//
//   - gmail.modify is read and write on the mailbox — searching, opening,
//     sending, drafts, labels — and it is one line rather than three because
//     Gmail's own documentation says so: modify supersedes readonly, and send
//     and compose are the halves of it a caller would otherwise have to ask for
//     separately. Three lines on a permissions screen that add up to what one
//     line says is a worse thing to read, not a safer one. What modify
//     deliberately stops short of is permanent deletion — a mailbox this
//     connection can write to is still one it cannot empty.
//   - calendar.events is read and write on the events of a person's calendars.
//     It is not calendar, which also carries the calendars themselves: making
//     and deleting whole calendars and changing who they are shared with is
//     nothing this program does, so it is nothing this program asks for.
