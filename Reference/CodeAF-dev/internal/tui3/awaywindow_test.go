// A SESSION KEEPS WORKING ON A WINDOW NOBODY IS LOOKING AT.
//
// The report this file is written from: several codeaf windows open on one
// machine, and whichever one the person walked away from seemed to stop. It
// was not the picture and it was not the engine — the engine's turn runs in
// its own goroutine behind an unbounded queue (session's agent.go), and the
// frame clock has never read focus at all. It was the approval countdown:
// ten seconds after the gate stopped a call, [app.tickQuestion]'s ancestor denied it on behalf
// of somebody who was two windows away and could not have known the question
// existed. Every call that turn tried to make came back refused, so the session
// really had stopped working, and the reason was on a screen behind them.
//
// So the clock is a clock about READING, and it only runs where there is
// somebody to read.

// awayAsk is one window with an approval question up and a countdown on it,
// plus the door that moves its clock.
