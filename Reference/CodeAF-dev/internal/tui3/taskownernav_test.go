// ── ONE ROW, ONE PIECE OF WORK, ONE DOOR ────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every row of work this surface draws is something a person can aim at, and
// what it opens is that row's own task and never another's. Both halves failed,
// in opposite directions, and the two failures look identical from the outside —
// a person clicks a task and does not get that task.
//
//   - A row another WINDOW is running took no cursor at all, so pressing it did
//     nothing and there was no way to tell a refusal from a broken screen.
//   - A row another CONVERSATION ran, numbered the same as one of this session's
//     and named the same, resolved to THIS session's node — so pressing it
//     opened a room, drew a transcript, and the transcript was a different task.
//
// The second is the worse of the two: a wrong page that looks right. Node ids
// restart with every conversation (internal/session's task_index.go states it on
// [session.TaskIndexEntry.ID]), so the pair that identifies a row is the
// conversation and the id — and this file holds that pair to it.
