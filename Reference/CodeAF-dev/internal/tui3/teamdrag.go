// ── DRAG AND DROP IN THE TEAMS RAIL: THE SHORTCUT (rulings c-12, c-13) ──────
//
// `Move into…` is the main road; a drag is the shortcut for a person whose
// hand is already on the pointer. Two things can be dragged:
//
//   - A TEAM ROW of the rail, onto another team row (`Drop to move api into
//     harbor`) or onto the empty rail under the tree, which is the top level.
//     Teams picked with `space` travel together when the one dragged is among
//     them. The move then goes exactly the way the picker's does
//     ([app.teamMoveAsk]): at once with Undo, or after the one consequence line.
//   - A MEMBER, from the members card, onto a team row. That ADDS the
//     conversation to the team (`Add @security to harbor`) and never takes it
//     out of the one it was dragged from: removing a conversation from a team is
//     always its own explicit act, so a drag cannot lose one.
//
// A DRAG STARTS ONLY AFTER TWO CELLS OF HELD MOVEMENT. A press that lets go
// where it landed, or a cell away, is a click and does what a click does (a
// team row selects its team, a member opens), because a hand on a mouse is
// never still and a one-cell wobble must not turn a click into a move.
//
// ONLY A TARGET THAT CAN TAKE THE DROP IS GROUNDED. Every other row under the
// pointer stays as it is and the hint line says why it will not take it, in
// the picker's own words. `esc` drops the drag and nothing happens.
//
// Like everything on the page it is memory: the rows and their targets are the
// last frame's ([teamsTarget]), and the write is an ordinary edit.

// teamDragCells is how far a held press must move before it is a drag.
