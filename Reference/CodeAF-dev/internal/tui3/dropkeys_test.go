// THE DROP LAWS, COUNTED.
//
// dropkeys.go exists because a drop does not always arrive in the shape
// imagepaste.go was written for. The owner dropped a screenshot on a real
// terminal over `--host` and got the escaped path as TEXT, then pressed enter
// and got `unknown command: /var/folders/…/Screenshot · try /help`. The bytes
// were the ones the paste door already handles perfectly; the DELIVERY was
// keystrokes.
//
// These tests are in two halves. The first states what a person gets, in every
// shape a terminal sends a drop in. The second states what it COSTS, the way
// PERF.md's doctrine demands: a count of the timers armed, the syscalls made
// and the frames built, never a stopwatch. Both halves have to hold, because a
// drop that lands and makes typing expensive is a defect somewhere else.

// dropLab is a conversation with files on the disk and a clock that does not
// move on its own, so a burst of characters can be delivered with provably
// nothing between them and the wakeup can be settled deliberately.
