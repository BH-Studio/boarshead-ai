// ── /debug BELONGS TO THE CONVERSATION IT WAS TYPED IN ──────────────────────
//
// One process can hold several conversations — an engine host holds one per
// person sitting in front of it — and the record holds their prompts, their
// files and the model's whole reply. So a /debug typed in one of them must turn
// the record on for THAT run and no other; a switch that could not tell them
// apart would land somebody's own data in a folder they never asked for.
//
// The three phases are one test on purpose: the last of them turns the
// PROCESS-wide switch on, which is deliberately one-way, so it cannot run
// before the two that need it off.
