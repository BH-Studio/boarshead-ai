// ── A TASK'S CALLS ARE THE SESSION'S CALLS ──────────────────────────────────
//
// The header instrument counts a node's calls and the Σ segment counts the
// session's background work, and until this landed they were two clocks: the
// room's reducer had no `closed` hook at all, so a task could start three
// servers and the segment said nothing, the quit guard let a person walk away
// from them, and any figure the status line was already showing went on being
// served from a cache no task event could drop.
//
// docs/design/lens/DESIGN.md, Decision 4: "a room's closed tools feed the same
// HUD/spend walk chat's do, so the header instrument and the ambient counters
// are one set of numbers."
