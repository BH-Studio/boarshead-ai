// THE HARNESS PANEL: /harness, and the chip that appears while one runs.
//
// A sub-harness is built in conversation and approved on a card there, which
// answers "may this be kept". What the conversation cannot answer is the
// question people ask a day later — WHAT HAVE I GOT, and what did it do last
// time — because the card that said so has scrolled away. That question is a
// LIST, which is a thing this surface already knows how to draw:
//
//	  ◆ triage-flake       v3 · chase a flaky test · 6 runs · 2h · finished
//	  ◆ review-diff        v1 · read a diff
//
// Three decisions, and all three are borrowed rather than invented:
//
//   - IT IS THE OVERLAY GRAMMAR (palette.go), exactly as /connect is: a short
//     list under the draft, ↑↓, enter, esc. A second list with its own manners
//     would be a second thing to learn for a question of the same shape.
//   - ENTER PRINTS THE CARD INTO THE CONVERSATION rather than opening a second
//     overlay. The card is prose — numbered steps, the bounds under them
//     (subharness.Card) — and the transcript is where prose lives on this
//     surface, where it can be scrolled, copied and read beside the work it is
//     about. An overlay would be a worse text viewer than the one on screen.
//   - THE RUNNING ONE IS A CHIP ON THE STRIP (taskstrip.go), not a bar of its
//     own. The strip is already the row that says WHAT IS ALIVE; a harness run
//     is alive for minutes at a time and belongs on it, in front of the tasks,
//     with the panel as its door.
//
// THE PANEL READS THE DISK AND THE AGENT SEPARATELY, and that is not an
// accident. What is REGISTERED is a directory, which any window may have written
// since this one booted, so the list is resolved on the keystroke that opens it.
// What is RUNNING is this session's own business, so it is polled off the agent
// while the frame is drawn.
//
// It is the OFFER's sibling and not its replacement (harness.go): that row asks
// whether to run one on this turn, this list says which ones exist.

// harnessRowsMax is how many LINES the panel takes at most — the same ceiling
// every bottom-anchored list on this surface has.
