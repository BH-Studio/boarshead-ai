// ── THE KEEPER ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE ASSUMPTION BEING REMOVED IS THAT A TERMINAL HOLDS ONE LIVE CONVERSATION,
// and this map is the whole of the new state it costs. The surface still draws
// exactly one conversation, still has one of every field and one of every
// overlay; what changed is that the conversations it is NOT drawing are still
// alive rather than closed.
//
// A conversation in here is fully alive. Its turn streams, its tasks run, its
// jobs run, its presence file heartbeats, its flock is held. It is not paused
// and not suspended — the surface simply is not looking at it.
//
// THE PERSON-FACING WORD FOR THIS IS `open`, NEVER `behind`. The status line
// reads `2 open · 1 waiting` and home's rung reads `open`, which is the word
// [session.SessionRow] already carries for the same fact seen from another
// window. `behind` describes a position on a screen nobody can see, which makes
// it furniture; `open` describes what is true.

// NO DOOR ONTO A CONVERSATION IS EVER REFUSED FOR HOW MANY ARE ALREADY OPEN.
// There was a cap — eight — and its own comment said that a cap hit in practice
// by somebody who was not testing it is evidence the number is wrong. It was hit
// in a day of ordinary use, and the owner's ruling on 2026-08-31 was to remove
// the limit rather than to raise it: "that is pointless". That ruling stands, and
// nothing below is a limit: the fiftieth `/new` opens exactly like the first.
//
// WHAT ONE OPEN CONVERSATION COSTS is what it always was — a few goroutines, its
// transcript, one file descriptor, a five-second presence tick and its
// transcript's lock. What used to be true of that cost is that NOTHING GAVE IT
// BACK except a person's own `/quit` or `ctrl+w`, so a window left running for a
// day grew with every conversation somebody had opened in it and never shrank.
//
// SO THE KEEPER SWEEPS ITS COLDEST QUIET CONVERSATION INSTEAD OF REFUSING A NEW
// ONE ([app.sweepKept]). Past [keptCeiling] open, the conversation that has been
// left the longest is let go of — but ONLY if letting go of it costs the person
// nothing: nothing turning in it, nothing waiting on them, no news they have not
// seen, no words of theirs still in its box ([app.keptQuiet] is the whole list).
// Where no held conversation answers that, the window goes on holding more than
// the ceiling. A REFUSAL AND A CLOSE ARE BOTH WORSE THAN A NUMBER BEING EXCEEDED,
// which is the trade this design makes and the reason the ceiling is soft.
//
// AND LETTING GO IS NOT ENDING SOMEBODY'S WORK. It goes through [leaveAgent], the
// same judgement `quit` makes: a hosted conversation is detached and goes on
// running on its engine, and an in-process one — which nothing else could run —
// is closed. Either way its transcript is on disk and every door reopens it.
// The keeper forgets the conversation on the frame; the agent is taken off
// afterwards ([leaveOffFrame]), so Interrupt and Close cannot stall a keystroke.

// WorkspaceGoneWord is what any door says about a workspace that is not there.
// It names the path the caller gave and nothing beyond it, because the caller is
// home and home already prints that path on the row the person pressed.
//
// IT IS EXPORTED SO THERE IS ONE OF IT. The surface says it on the keystroke —
// one os.Stat, before an agent is built — and cmd/codeaf says it again when a
// directory disappears between that stat and the open. Two spellings of one
// refusal would drift, and this is the sentence the manual quotes.
const WorkspaceGoneWord = "that folder is gone"

// kept is one conversation this process holds that is not on screen: the bundle
// the door built around its agent, the readings the person left in it, and the
// small goroutine that keeps it from starving.
type kept struct {
	// conv is everything the door resolved around this agent — the workspace,
	// the draft file, the recall list, the three approval closures. It goes back
	// through [app.takeUp] on the way in, which is what stops a keystroke in one
	// conversation reaching a closure minted around another.
	conv Conversation
	// side is what the person left: the box, the messages waiting behind its
	// running turn, their pictures and documents, where they were reading, what
	// was left of an approval countdown, and the room they had open
	// (switcher.go's [aside]).

// behindStirMsg is a conversation this process holds asking to be looked at
// again. IT CARRIES NO CONTENT — only which conversation — because the surface
// holds that agent's pointer and can simply read it.
//
// THAT EMPTINESS IS WHAT KEEPS THE GENERATION LAW TRUE. Every other message on
// this surface belongs to a lane of the conversation in front, and a stale one
// discards itself by generation. A stir belongs to no lane and to no turn: it
// names a key, the surface looks it up, and a stir for a conversation that has
// since been closed finds nothing in the map and does nothing at all — the same
// shape a stale generation has, needing no new rule.
type behindStirMsg struct {
	key string
	// quiet is a stir that is ONLY a redraw: the conversation said something
	// that changes what it is CALLED and nothing about what it is doing. It is a
	// separate bit rather than a second lane because the banner rules
	// ([app.behindStir]) are the thing it has to skip, and skipping them is one
	// branch there.
	//
	// WITHOUT IT A LATE NAME RAISES AN ATTENTION BANNER. behindStir re-reads the
	// agent and announces `waiting on you` whenever the conversation needs the
	// person — which is right for a stir that means "something happened" and
	// wrong for one that means "it is called this now": a held conversation
	// sitting on a question would raise that banner again every time it named
	// itself, and consume the landed flag that the finished banner is counted

// behindWatch is one conversation's stir watcher, and it exists for a reason
// that must not be deleted by a future lane trying to save memory.
//
// THREE THINGS IT DOES, IN ORDER OF WHY IT IS HERE:
//
//  1. IT DRAINS. A detached conversation has no reader, and an eventStream is an
//     unbounded producer queue in front of an unbuffered channel: the producer
//     never blocks and never drops, so nothing stalls — but the pump parks
//     forever on its last send and the queue grows for the rest of the turn
//     (session's agent.go says both, on [eventStream.pump] and on the queue).
//     So every lane this agent offers is subscribed here and every event is
//     thrown away.
//  2. IT COUNTS TWO EDGES: a turn finishing, and the agent starting or stopping
//     needing a person ([session.Agent.NeedsPerson]).
//  3. IT STIRS, at most one outstanding at a time, so the surface can refresh
//     the count on the status line and raise the desktop banner. The surface has
//     no idle ticker and is not getting one (render.go), so without this a
//     conversation could finish its work in silence.
//
// The alternative — keep every lane subscribed to the program loop and discard
// the messages on arrival — was rejected: it wakes the frame for events nobody
// is watching, which on a window full of them is the exact cost this design
// exists to avoid, and it needs the discard to be correct, which is a
// conversation id on every message type.
type behindWatch struct {

	// armed is the "at most one outstanding" rule. A watcher that sent a stir
	// nobody has folded in yet sends no more of them: the surface reads the
	// agent when it wakes, so a second nudge to read the same pointer buys
	// nothing and costs a frame.
	armed atomic.Bool
	// landed says a turn ended in here since the surface last looked. It is the
	// one fact a re-read of the agent cannot recover — a finished turn leaves no
	// trace on the agent that says "and it finished just now" — so it is carried
	// on the watcher and taken by the surface rather than put on the message.
	landed atomic.Bool
	// finished counts turns that have ended in here since the person left, and
	// it is a COUNTER BESIDE [behindWatch.landed] rather than a second reader of
	// it: landed is consumed on every stir ([behindWatch.took]), so by the time
	// the switcher asks, the fact that a turn landed has usually already been
	// spent on a banner. This is the same edge, kept for the card to read.
	//
	// NOTHING RESETS IT, because nothing has to: the watcher dies when the
	// conversation comes forward ([app.bringForward] stops it), so the count is
	// always "since you left", by construction rather than by bookkeeping.
	finished atomic.Int64
	// takeover says another window has asked for this conversation
	// ([session.EventTakeover], takeover.go). It is the ONE thing this watcher
	// reads the content of a lane for: every other event here is a nudge, and
	// this one is a conversation that is about to end.
	takeover atomic.Bool
	// moved says another window has OPENED this conversation through the engine
	// that holds it ([session.EventMoved], takeover.go).
	//
	// IT IS A SECOND FLAG AND NOT THE ONE ABOVE, because the two endings are not
	// the same ending: a takeover ends the conversation in this process and a
	// move detaches from one that goes on running elsewhere. A single flag would
	// make the surface guess which, and the guess it would make is the one that
	// stops somebody's work.
	moved atomic.Bool
	// waits and turning are WHAT THIS CONVERSATION IS DOING, cached here so that
	// a surface drawing a mark on its tab does not have to ask the agent
	// (tabsignal.go).
	//
	// THEY COST NOTHING BECAUSE THE LOOP ALREADY COMPUTES THEM. `waits` is set at
	// the edge [behindWatch.run] already finds — it compares [needsPerson]
	// against the last answer on every pass to decide whether to stir — and
	// `turning` is set at the three places a turn's stream is taken up or given
	// back. Neither adds a call, a lock or an allocation.
	//
	// AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THEM BEING HERE. The alternative is asking
	// each agent on each frame: [session.Agent.NeedsPerson] takes the agent's
	// mutex and allocates a map (session's taskpresence.go), and the running
	// count comes from [session.Agent.TaskIndex], which READS A FILE. The tab
	// strip is laid out on every frame and states its own law in as many words —
	// it opens no file and crosses no wire (chattabs.go) — so a status read from
	// either of those would be a world scan thirty times a second, or a call to
	// another machine over `--host`.
	//
	// AN UNSET PAIR IS "NOTHING KNOWN", which the strip draws as nothing at all.
	// A conversation with no watcher — one over a shared handle, one this window
	// only remembers — never claims to be running, which is the tab strip's own
	// law about what a tab is allowed to claim.
	waits   atomic.Bool
	turning atomic.Bool
	// tasking is WORK THIS CONVERSATION STARTED THAT OUTLIVES THE TURN THAT

	// drew that conversation at rest while it was the busiest one in the window,
	// which is the defect this field closes (tabsignal.go).
	//
	// IT IS FOLDED FROM THE LANE THIS LOOP ALREADY DRAINS. Every node's state

// conversations are all busy sails past it. The number is the switcher card's

// FIFTEEN MINUTES IS LONG ENOUGH THAT SWITCHING AROUND COSTS NOTHING. Somebody
// working across four projects is in and out of each of them inside a minute, and

// reaches them however many are open. What it reaches is the conversation opened

// bottom: that stack is the conversations this window has been in, most recent
// last ([app.rememberOpen]), so walking it forwards is walking from the one left
// longest ago. Keys it holds that the keeper does not are stepped over — the

// surface and this is not the lane that gets one (render.go) — so a window left
// completely alone keeps what it holds, and the first keystroke that opens
// another conversation is what collects it.
//
