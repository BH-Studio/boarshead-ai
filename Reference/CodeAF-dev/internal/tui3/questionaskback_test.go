// ── ASKING BACK GOES THROUGH THE DOOR THAT KEEPS THE QUESTION OPEN ──────────
//
// #910 built the engine's half: an answer carrying nothing but
// [session.Answer.AskedBack] returns the parked `ask` call with the person's
// words and a lead saying the question is still on their screen and not to ask
// it again (tools_ask.go's `askedBackLead`), and [session.AnswerResolves] says
// so at both ends. Before this the surface had no way to reach it: `?` sent the
// sentence as an ordinary new message, which arrived at the model with none of
// that context and left the call parked behind it.
//
// AND THE LANES WITHOUT THE SEAM KEEP THE OLD ROAD. `AnswerResolves` RESOLVES a
// consent that carries only words asked back — approving it with no key — so
// routing every lane through the door would turn a question into an approval.
// That is why [app.askBack] asks the predicate rather than listing kinds.

// askLab is the model's own question, which is the lane that has the seam.
