// ── WHICH DRAWING A QUESTION GETS ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ONE FUNCTION DECIDES, AND IT ASKS THE QUESTION'S OWN PROPERTIES.
//
// It used to be four decisions in four places, each keyed on a different thing:
// [app.questionForm] read the asker's `Form` word and the count of its options,
// [app.questionNarrowed] read the width, the sheet drew itself whenever it had
// rows, and home and the errand pane each called a renderer by name. A person
// could not predict which shape a question would take, and neither could a lane.
//
// So the ladder below is the whole of it, it is DATA rather than a chain of
// names, and every rung is a property of the question or of the frame — never
// its [session.QuestionKind]. A kind is where a question came from; what decides
// how much room it needs is what it CARRIES. The first rung that says yes wins,
// and each one states why it is above the next.

// questionView is which drawing a question gets.
