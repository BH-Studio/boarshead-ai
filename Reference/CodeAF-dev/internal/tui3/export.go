// /export: THE CONVERSATION, AS A DOCUMENT SOMEBODY ELSE CAN READ.
//
// It is the third of the doors onto getting text out (commands.go), and it is
// the one that is not about this screen. /copy and /select hand over what a
// person can SEE — the tail of a conversation, in the shapes a terminal drew it
// in — and the answer to "send me what we worked out this morning" is usually
// not on the screen any more.
//
// SO IT IS WRITTEN FROM THE WHOLE CONVERSATION, [Agent.Transcript], and never
// from [app.entries]. That slice is the forty-entry replay tail (replay.go): a
// document built from it would be a document that quietly starts in the middle,
// which is worse than no document at all, because nothing about the file says
// so.
//
// WHAT IS WRITTEN IS THE CONVERSATION AND NOT THE PLUMBING. The person's turns
// and the model's words are the document — the model's verbatim, because what it
// writes IS markdown and re-rendering it here would be a second opinion about
// somebody else's text. A tool call is one line saying what was done, and its
// answer is kept only while it stays small: a reader opening this file came for
// what was said, and an export carrying a thousand lines of `git status` is a
// file nobody reaches the end of.
//
// NOTHING HERE WAITS ON A DISK. The stat, the directory and the write all happen
// inside the returned command, the way the draft's write does (draft.go), and
// what comes back is one line in the conversation: where it went, or why it did
// not go anywhere.

// The document's three budgets, all of them about the same thing — a tool call
// is a FOOTNOTE in a document about a conversation, and a footnote that runs
// over the page has stopped being one.
