// `/budget` — THE KEYBOARD DOOR ONTO THE LIMITS.
//
// It is a door and not a second editor (docs/design/spending/DESIGN.md): bare,
// it opens the Spending tab with the cursor on the row a person almost always
// means; with an amount, it writes THROUGH THE SAME REGISTRY ROW the tab writes
// through, so what /budget lands and what the panel lands are byte-identical.
//
// IT IS THE DOOR THAT WORKS FROM WHERE THE PERSON IS STANDING. Every letter on
// this surface belongs to a text box — the composer, a place's own box, the
// panel's search — which is the product and not a compromise (verbstrip.go's
// first law), so the door that a refused turn can name has to be one a person
// can type into the box they are already looking at. That is this.
//
// THE ROWS IT NAMES ARE THE ROWS THAT EXIST. `day`, `conversation`, `plan` and
// `practice` are the four rails a person can turn; a task and a standing firing
// are named on the tab as READINGS because this build enforces them somewhere a
// settings row cannot reach (settingspend.go), and a command that accepted
// `task 20` would be writing a number nothing reads.

// budgetRows is the word a person types against the registry row it names, and
// the words are the tab's own labels rather than the keys behind them.
