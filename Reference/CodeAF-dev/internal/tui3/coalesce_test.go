// THE STORM LAWS, COUNTED.
//
// PERF.md's doctrine is that a gate counts work and never wall time, and these
// are written that way: the ceiling on a sweep is stated as ANSWERS — how many
// of six hundred motions the router was made to handle — and the promise about
// a key is stated as "before any command of the sweep's had to run", which is a
// fact about the order of the calls rather than about how long they took. Both
// hold on a loaded CI box and both mean the same thing on a machine three years
// faster, which a stopwatch would not.
//
// The numbers here are the ones PERF.md's "the storm laws" section names. A
// change to either changes that file in the same commit.

// stormApp is a settled conversation with rows a pointer can answer to, at a
// size a sweep has somewhere to sweep across.

// SIX HUNDRED MOTIONS FOLLOWED BY ONE KEY: THE KEY IS HANDLED WITHIN ONE FRAME
// OF ARRIVING, and the six hundred cost ONE answer between them.
//
// This is the law the whole of coalesce.go exists for. Over a link a single
// motion costs about twenty milliseconds of work, so six hundred answered in
// full is twelve seconds during which a typed character sits in the terminal's
// pipe behind them — which is exactly what a person sweeping a pointer over a
// long conversation and then typing used to get.
//
// It is counted rather than timed. `answered` is how many messages the router
// was actually made to handle; `folded` is how many were dropped as already
// false. And the key is proved not to have waited by the strongest statement
// there is: its character is in the draft the moment its own Update returns,
// with the sweep's own wakeup still unrun.
