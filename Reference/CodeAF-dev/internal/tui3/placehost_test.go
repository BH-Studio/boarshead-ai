//
// A place is a listing of one machine's disk, and over a connection that machine
// is the one the SESSION runs on. Until this file existed only home said so: the
// other five walked ~/.codeaf/v3 under this process — the laptop's — and drew
// what they found under a conversation living somewhere else. The tasks place
// was the worst of them, because it drew a count and a total in dollars: "work
// codeaf ran on its own. 8, $22.54 of it." was the laptop's eight tasks and the
// laptop's money, on a session on a server.
//
// EVERY READING HAS A FAR DOOR NOW. These tests keep the compatibility floor as
// well: when an older engine lacks a door, the place says its honest sentence
// and never falls through to this machine's files.

// placeText is whatever place is standing, drawn and stripped of its paint.
