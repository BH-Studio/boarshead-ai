// ── THE JOB PAGE AND THE RECORD CARD DROP WHOLE HINTS ───────────────────────
//
// Both feet were painted through a plain [fit], which is a character ruler with
// no idea what a clause is, so a narrow terminal ended them `· m puts it in
// yo…` — a sheet that names a key and then eats it. The structural law in
// narrow_test.go now covers every foot on the surface with an empty ledger;
// these are the two behaviours behind it, said as a person meets them.

// THE WAY OUT IS NAMED ONCE PER FRAME, AND ALWAYS ONCE.
//
// Two laws met on these two feet and they were read as a conflict. One: the way
// out is the LAST clause of a key row, because [hintFit] keeps its final clause
// to the last cell there is and spends the ones in front of it first — a foot
// that led with `esc back` was a foot that gave the way out away first, and a
// sixty-cell card ended up offering `m puts it in your message` and no way off
// the page. Two: `esc back` was drawn TWICE on every frame of these pages, once
// in the head's right corner and once at the end of the foot, which on a
// six-line card spent two of its sixteen words repeating one instruction
// (docs/design/polish/audit-tasks.md row 15).
//
// They do not actually conflict, and this is the resolution: THE FOOT CARRIES
// THE WAY OUT ONLY WHERE THE HEAD DOES NOT. The head keeps its corner at almost
// every width, so almost every foot is the `Held` sheet; where the title has
// eaten the corner — or the frame is too narrow to have one — the foot takes
// the way out back, at the END, where the first law wants it. So the narrow
// case is not weakened: it is the case that still spends `esc back` last.
