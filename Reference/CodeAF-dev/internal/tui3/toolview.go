// The grammar is four parts and every one of them is a decision:
//
//   - the RAIL says these rows are one thing. `╰─▶` is the last call, `├─▶`
//     every call above it, `│ ` an expanded call's detail; a terminal that
//     cannot draw them gets `+-> ` and `| `, which are the same widths.
//   - the NAME is chrome, so it is the muted accent. The TARGET — the path,
//     the command, the pattern — is what the person is actually reading, so it
//     leads: primary ink, and never dimmed as a whole. What QUALIFIES it — a
//     `cd` prefix, a line range, the directory a pattern is searched in —
//     recedes to dim within it (see the parameter hierarchy, below).
//   - the STAT trails, dim, and is derived from the payload in toolstat.go.
//   - the MARK: the call's state at the line's right end, and its elapsed time
//     once there is one. NO SUCCESS GLYPH, EVER. A column of ✓ is a column that
//     must be read to learn nothing; a quiet line is a success.
//
// At most [toolWindow] calls stay on screen; the rest fold into one line that
// says how many, and ctrl+o (or a click on that line) unfolds them. One call
// opens inline — click it, or select it with ↑/↓ and press enter — and shows a
// tool-shaped expansion under the rail rather than in a pane somewhere else.
// A TASK'S PAGE KEEPS AS MANY AS ITS VIEW IS TALL instead of three, and there a
// scroll up at the top of the page opens the fold too (render.go's
// [deck.toolTail], room.go's [app.roomScroll]).

// toolDetail is a call's payload as the surface holds it: the two display
// fields internal/session sends (session.go's Event.Args and Event.Output),

//
// THE COLUMN DROPS WHOLE SEGMENTS RATHER THAN CLIPPING CHARACTERS, in a stated
// order — the size first, then the duration, and the mark is never given up (see
// [app.toolTail]). Half a figure is worse than no figure: "12.4 K" is a number a
// person has to distrust, and a column cut two cells short of its spinner is a
// row that claims nothing is happening. Below the floor for the mark alone, the
// column is absent entirely, which is the emptiness law.

// never the turn's span — and one too fast to have a duration draws none.

// toolBlock is the memo of what hangs under one tool row: the rows, how many the

//
// ── WHY A TOOL ROW NEEDS ONE ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Tool rows are drawn on every frame and cached nowhere (render.go's
// [app.entryRows] states the rule and says why: one of them is always animating,
// and a cache with an animation in it is a still photograph). What that reasoning
// left out is that the animation is on the LINE and never in the BLOCK. The line
// carries the spinner, the count-up and the pointer's brightness; the block under
// it is a diff, a file, a command's output — evidence about a payload that
// arrived once and does not change again.
//
// So the line is redrawn thirty times a second, as it must be, and the block is
// redrawn when something about it has actually changed. What the old rule cost,
// per frame and per call on screen: an [argsOf] re-unmarshal of the whole
// argument object, a unified diff recomputed over every replacement before the
// cap threw most of it away, a chroma pass per line, and the whole of a tool's
// output rendered so that thirty rows of it could be kept. The paint clock
// invalidates the transcript every 33ms for as long as a turn runs, so that bill
// was paid for every FINISHED call in the conversation as well as for the live one.
//
// ── THE KEY ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Everything the block is derived from and nothing that is not: the width it was
// laid out to and the tier that width chose, the call's state, whether the person
// opened it, whether they lifted its cap, and the four strings the rows are made
// of.
//
// The strings are COMPARED RATHER THAN MEASURED. A length is the cheap key and
// the wrong one — two payloads of the same size are one silent stale block — and
// it buys nothing, because Go's string comparison answers on the data pointer
// when both sides hold the same bytes, which is what a memo that kept the very
// string it rendered always holds.
//
// THE PALETTE IS THE ONE THING THE KEY CANNOT SEE, for codeview.go's reason:
// these are finished strings with the escape sequences already inside them, and a
// re-measured ground changes neither a payload nor a width. [app.repaintPalette]
// drops the lot by hand.
// It hangs off the entry as a POINTER, which is also what distinguishes "this
// row hangs nothing" from "nothing has been worked out for this row yet" —
// something an empty slice cannot say — and what keeps [entry] small enough that
// the three passes walking a whole deck per frame do not pay for it.

//   - THE STATE GLYPH LEADS. On a wide frame the mark sits at the right end,
//     where there is always room for it; on a phone the right end is exactly
//     where the row runs out, and a state that competed with the target for the
//     last cells would be a state that disappears on the rows that have the
//     most to say. A fixed cell at the left is a COLUMN — the one thing a
//     narrow screen reads well — and it costs the target two cells, flat.
//     The machine behind it is unchanged: [app.mark], the same ◌ → ? → spinner
//     → (nothing) / ✗ every other tier draws, and a success is still silent.
//   - THE TARGET SHEDS ITS QUALIFIER AND KEEPS ITS TAIL ([phoneTarget]). The
//     parameter hierarchy already said which half of a target is substance and
//     which is context; at this width context is not dimmed, it is dropped, and
//     a path collapses to the basename that distinguishes it.
//   - THE CLOCK IS ONE FIGURE ([app.phoneClock]). A finished call's duration or
//     a running one's age, never a bound stated beside an age — that is
//     arithmetic, and arithmetic is the first thing forty-four columns give up.
//   - AND IT SHEDS WHAT IT CANNOT HOLD IN THE WIDE ROW'S ORDER. The size goes
//     first and the duration after it, and the state is never given up at all —
//     the same order [app.toolTail] applies to the wide row's right column, off

//     and never differently, which is what stops a person who has read one
//     shape from having to learn a second.
