// THE SPLICE, FROM THE KEYBOARD: a sentence sent INTO the answer that is
// already running.
//
// Plain enter is the expected chat gesture and therefore the primary door. It
// cuts the generation that is currently streaming, preserves its arrived text,
// and sends the draft into the same turn. `cmd+enter` keeps the older choice to
// park the draft for the next turn, and `ctrl+shift+enter` still stops the whole turn
// before sending (bargein.go).
//
// A STEER INTERRUPTS ONE GENERATION, NOT THE TURN. The person's own line is
// drawn as soon as EventSteerAccepted arrives, with a muted clause saying
// whether it cut the reply, preserved a bash job, stopped that command, or is
// waiting for a short tool boundary (steerelbow.go).
//
// ── TWO DOORS, ONE ROAD ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//	enter       with a sentence in the box: that sentence goes in.
//	cmd+enter   with a sentence in the box: that sentence waits.
//	→           with an EMPTY box and a message already waiting: that message
//	            is promoted out of the queue and goes in (park.go).
//
// Both are [app.promoteParked]. The chord does not reimplement the send: it
// takes [app.enterLine]'s whole road exactly as [app.bargeIn] does — so a slash
// command still runs at once, a live tag still takes its own door, a picked
// harness still takes the sentence, an empty box still does nothing — and then
// promotes the message that road parked. That is not an economy; it is the
// correctness argument, and it is bargein.go's, said again: there is no second
// copy of the guard list to drift out of step with the first.
//
// ── WHAT CANNOT BE STEERED, AND WHY IT IS LEFT WAITING ──────────────────────
//
// [session.Agent.Steer] is WORDS ONLY — pictures reach a running turn by their
// own door, which assembles parts and journals durable references — and a
// sentence somebody MARKED as something to keep true is a sentence bound for a
// different door entirely (standmark.go). Neither is refused with a note: the
// message simply stays parked and goes as its own turn, which is what it would
// have done had nobody pressed anything. A gesture whose failure mode is the
// default behaviour needs no apology for it.
//
// ── THE REFUSAL IS ANSWERED BY DELIVERING THE WORDS ANYWAY ──────────────────
//
// The engine refuses a steer with [session.ErrNothingToSteer] when no turn is in
// flight, and there is a real window in which that is the honest answer and the
// person did nothing wrong: the turn ended between the frame that offered the
// key and the finger that pressed it. THE PERSON WANTED THE WORDS DELIVERED, so
// they are delivered the ordinary way — back onto the waiting queue, at the head
// they left, where the queue's own machinery sends them ([app.sendParked]). No
// note is drawn, because nothing went wrong: what they see is a message that
// waited, which is what plain enter promises.
//
// ── THE EVENTS DRAW THE PERSON'S LINE ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// The three events a steer produces — [session.EventSteerAccepted],
// [session.EventSteerConsumed], [session.EventSteerFellThrough] — are sent
// through the RUNNING TURN'S hub, so they arrive on the stream this surface is
// already pumping and are drawn by the transcript's own arms (steerelbow.go).
//
// AND THE STEER'S OWN CHANNEL IS NOT THIS FILE'S EITHER. [session.Agent.Steer]
// hands back a stream of its own, and every door here does the same one thing
// with it: gives it to [app.holdSteer] and forgets it. That lane is the single
// reader — a channel with two of them is a channel whose events are split
// between them — and it exists for the one thing the turn's own stream cannot
// carry: a steer that fell through starts a turn that speaks on that channel
// and nowhere else.

// parkKey is the secondary chord as a PERSON spells it. Plain enter is the
// primary send and steers while a turn runs; this chord preserves the older
// choice to hold the sentence for the answer after this one.
//
// WHY THIS ONE — WHAT THE AUDIT LEFT. The gesture has to read as a SEND rather
// than as a letter, which means a modifier on enter, and the other three are
// spent: `alt+enter` (with `ctrl+j`) opens a line, `ctrl+enter` queues the
// sentence for after this turn (followup.go), and `ctrl+shift+enter` stops the
// answer and sends (bargein.go). cmd+enter is what is left, and it is the right
// one on its own merits — it is the "send it now, properly" chord in every chat
// application a person has ever used. Here it is deliberately secondary: plain
// enter reaches the model, while this chord says to wait.
const parkKey = "cmd+enter"

// steerKeySuper and steerKeyMeta are the two names the SAME keystroke arrives
// under, and both are bound because which one a terminal sends is a fact about
// the road the bytes took rather than about the hand that made them.
//
// A kitty-protocol terminal sends `CSI 13;9u`, which ultraviolet's CSI-u reader
// decodes against the kitty modifier table, where bit 8 is `super`. A terminal
// speaking xterm's modifyOtherKeys sends `CSI 27;9;13~` instead, which is read
// against the STATIC table, where the ninth column is `meta`. Same key, same
// hand, two names — the same split that left cmd+←/→ bound as `super+left` and
// dead on every terminal there is until commit 7c427797 bound both. The wire
// test in steer_test.go is what keeps this comment honest rather than the
// comment itself.

// steerSendWord is what this gesture DOES, in the words both lines that name it
// use — ONE SOURCE OF TRUTH for a person-facing phrase that now appears in two
// slots on one screen, which is [bargeSendWord]'s own arrangement. The hint

// line says `→ steers it in`; they are the same three words because they are
