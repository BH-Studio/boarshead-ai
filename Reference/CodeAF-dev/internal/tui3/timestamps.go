// THE CLOCK, AS THE TRANSCRIPT CARRIES IT.
//
// This surface had exactly one time on it — the running call's count-up — and
// that is the time of the four seconds you are living in. Everything ABOVE the
// live edge had none: a conversation read back an hour later, or opened again
// the next morning, was a wall of text with no answer to "when was this" and no
// answer to "what did that turn cost me". Both are facts about work the person
// paid for, and neither is derivable from anything else on screen.
//
// So the clock arrives in two shapes, and they are two because they answer two
// different questions:
//
//	 …the reply ends
//	                                       · 14:02 · 2m12s · 3 tools · $0.04 ·
//
//	── Thu, Aug 14 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//	── 14:02 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//	› and then the person came back
//
//   - THE TURN FOOTER is the receipt: when the turn ended, how long it took,
//     how many calls it made, what it cost. One dim line, RIGHT-ALIGNED, under
//     the turn it is about — right because the conversation is read down the
//     left and a receipt is not part of the reading, and dim because it is
//     furniture until somebody goes looking for it.
//
//   - THE SEPARATORS are the seam: a mark where the conversation was PUT DOWN
//     and picked up again. They are drawn only at a gap of [timeGap] or at a day
//     boundary, because a mark between two messages typed a minute apart says
//     nothing, and a surface that stamps every message is a chat log.
//
// FROZEN AT COMMIT. A footer's four figures are read once, at the moment the
// turn settles ([app.stampTurn]), and never recomputed: the elapsed time of a
// finished turn does not change, and a number that moved after the fact would
// be a receipt that could not be trusted. Only the PAINT follows the clock —
// see [app.stampPaint].
//
// THE FULL DATE IS ONE KEY AWAY. ctrl+o already means "show me the rest of this
// turn" (it unfolds the turn's tool calls), so an unfolded turn spends its
// footer's first field on the whole ISO timestamp instead of on four digits.
// A person who wants the exact instant asks for the detail they were already
// asking for, and a person who does not never sees a 25-column date.

// turn ended. Everything in it is frozen there.
