// THE CONNECTIONS PANEL: /connect.
//
// The offer beside it (connect.go) is what a person meets when the agent needs
// an account it does not have. This is the same subject asked the other way
// round — "what have I connected, and what else could I" — and it is a LIST,
// which is a thing this surface already knows how to draw:
//
//	  ✓ Google              jane@example.com
//
//	  · Slack               your channels and messages
//
// Five decisions, the last two of which are what a CATALOG did to this panel:
//
//   - IT IS THE OVERLAY GRAMMAR, unchanged (palette.go). A short list under the
//     draft, ↑↓ to move, enter to act, esc to leave — the same rows the model
//     picker and the session picker draw, because a second list that behaved
//     differently would be a second thing to learn for a question that is the
//     same shape.
//   - TWO GLYPHS AND A NAME. A tick where the account is held, a dim dot where
//     it is not, and then the word a person owns the account by. What is dim on
//     the right is whichever fact the row actually has: the account when there
//     is one, and otherwise the one line that says what connecting it would be
//     for. Never both, and never a placeholder for either.
//   - ENTER MEANS THE OBVIOUS THING IN EVERY DIRECTION. On a browser row that is
//     not connected it starts the sign-in — the same browser, the same waiting
//     block, the same tick as the offer's own path, because it IS that path. On
//     a key row it opens the same box the offer opens, in the same place the
//     filter was. On a connected row it asks once and disconnects on the second
//     press: an account is a thing somebody else's session may be using, and one
//     keystroke is not enough of a decision to drop it.
//   - CONNECTED FIRST AND FLAT, THEN THE CATALOG UNDER ITS OWN WORDS. The list
//     answers two questions and they are not the same question: "what have I
//     got" is a handful of rows a person recognizes, and "what else is there" is
//     a catalog of a few hundred. So the accounts this profile HAS sit at the
//     top with no heading over them — a rule labelled "connected" would be
//     furniture explaining what the ticks already said, and six rows a person
//     recognizes need no word to be found by — and everything underneath is
//     grouped by category, one dim lowercase word per group, alphabetical with
//     "other" last. THE WORDS ARE NOT THIS FILE'S. The grouping and the filter
//     over it are [groupConnections] and [filterConnections] (connectcaps.go),
//     called from here, because the settings sheet's Connections tab lists the
//     same catalog and two surfaces that sorted it separately would eventually
//     disagree about which category Stripe is in. A HEADING IS A LABEL AND NOT A
//     ROW: ↑↓ step over it, it belongs to no service, and a press on it does
//     nothing rather than acting on whichever row it was nearest. And where no
//     service declares a category at all the grouping comes back as ONE UNHEADED
//     GROUP, which is this panel's older shape exactly — connected, one blank
//     row, the rest — so a catalog gaining its categories changes what the list
//     SAYS and never what it is.
//   - PAST TEN AVAILABLE IT IS A LIST YOU SEARCH, not one you read. A catalog of
//     a few hundred services cannot be walked with ↓, so the box under it
//     becomes a filter and the list narrows as it is typed into — the palette
//     idiom, in the palette's own position (palette.go, input.go's
//     [app.inputBlock]). Under ten, there is no box: a filter over six rows is a
//     widget explaining itself.
//
// The panel is modal while it is up, which every list on this surface that opens
// on a COMMAND is (the model picker, the session picker). The lists that open by
// TYPING are the ones that are not.
