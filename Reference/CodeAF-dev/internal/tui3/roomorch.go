// AN ADAPTIVE RUN IS A PLACE TOO, AND THE PLACE IS A GRAPH.
//
// room.go says a task is a place you can go, and what you find when you get
// there is a TRANSCRIPT: one worker, saying things in order. An adaptive run
// (internal/orchestrate) is not one worker and does not happen in order. A
// planner amends the frontier on every completion while the scheduler launches
// whatever became free — so the only honest picture of it is the one the
// package's own doc comment describes: the graph is never designed, it
// CRYSTALLIZES, and a person watching it is watching a shape appear.
//
// So a run's page is not a transcript with a graph drawn on it. It is the
// graph: nodes as chips in topological layers, the planner's notes as thin
// lines between them, and one fuel gauge pinned at the top. Nothing on it
// scrolls past — a node that finished is still a chip, in the layer it was
// always in, wearing a different glyph.
//
// ── IT IS THE SAME ROOM, POINTED AT A RUN ──
//
// This file adds no second page mechanism. A run's page IS a [taskRoom] whose
// [taskRoom.orch] is set, which means every promise room.go makes holds here
// with no restatement: esc leaves and the conversation is untouched, the rail
// stays on screen, the scroll is the room's own, the box under it is the
// room's box, copy mode freezes what is drawn, and the frame's geometry
// ([app.roomWindow], [app.bodyRows], [app.headHeight]) never learns there are
// two kinds of page. What this file owns is what a run's page IS: the layers,
// the chips, the card behind a chip, and the gate.
//
// ── THE POLL IS THE LANE ──
//
// A task's page is fed by a channel of events. A run has no such channel for
// its shape — the orchestrator publishes a [orchestrate.Snapshot] and the room
// reads it ([session.Agent.OrchestrateSnapshot]) — so the page POLLS, four
// times a second, and redraws only when what it read differs from what it drew.
// Four times a second is the rate at which a graph appearing reads as a graph
// appearing rather than as a page flickering, and it is cheap: a snapshot is a
// struct copy, not a render.
//
// The three EVENT kinds are the rest of it, and they carry what a snapshot
// cannot: the planner's note as it lands, the fuel warning at the 80% mark, and
// the PAUSE, which is a question. They arrive on the session's STANDING run lane
// (app.go's [app.watchRuns]) rather than on a turn's stream, because a run
// outlives the turn that asked for it and its gate has no turn to arrive on;
// [app.orchestrateEvent] folds them in through [app.orchNoteEvent],
// [app.orchFuelEvent] and [app.orchPauseEvent].
//
// ── THE DOORS ARE ASSERTED, NEVER REQUIRED ──
//
// [orchAgent] is a fourth optional interface on this surface, asserted at the
// moment a run's page opens, for [taskRoomAgent]'s reason exactly: a session
// with no orchestrator under it (session.Config.OrchestrateRunner is nil, which
// is orchestration off) keeps everything else it had and says so in one note.

// orchAgent is the three doors onto one adaptive run (internal/session's
// orchestrate.go).
