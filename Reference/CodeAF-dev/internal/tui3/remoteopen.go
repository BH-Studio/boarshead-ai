// OPENING A FILE THAT IS ON ANOTHER MACHINE, WITH THIS MACHINE'S OWN VIEWER.
//
// remotefiles.go says which paths are real and hands out the door's URLs; this
// file is the other half of the same errand — the one where a person does not
// want a browser tab, they want Preview, or their editor, or whatever this
// laptop opens a `.csv` with. The three steps between those two wishes are
// content, a name, and a handoff.
//
// ── ONE: THE CACHE, KEYED BY CONTENT AND CHECKED AGAINST THE FAR DISK ───────
//
// [remote.FetchedFile] carries the sha256 of its own bytes, which is the digest
// internal/cas keys on — so "have I already got this" is one map lookup and one
// stat, and a file opened twice crosses the wire once. The digest is VERIFIED
// against the bytes rather than trusted: it arrived from another machine, and a
// content-addressed store whose keys are somebody else's arithmetic is not
// content-addressed. A hash the surface computed itself is what goes in.
//
// THE CACHE IS KEYED BY PATH AND THE FILE IS ON SOMEBODY ELSE'S DISK, so the
// cache cannot be believed without asking. A digest is a fact about bytes this
// surface already holds and says nothing whatever about the file those bytes
// came from; the far machine is a machine that is WORKING, and the model
// rewriting `out/report.md` four times in a turn is the ordinary case rather
// than the exotic one. A path→digest map with no freshness rule serves the
// first fetch's bytes for the rest of the session, and the person sees a stale
// document with no way to tell.
//
// SO EVERY FETCH ASKS FIRST, AND THE QUESTION IS ONE SMALL FRAME.
// [remote.PathFact] carries the size and the modification time now, so
// [farStat] is a single-path Stat.Paths — a few milliseconds — and the answer
// is compared against the numbers the cached bytes were fetched at. Same size,
// same mtime: the cache answers and NOTHING CROSSES. Different: the bytes are
// fetched again and the new copy replaces the old under the same path. An
// unchanged file therefore still costs one round trip and not a transfer, which
// is the difference the cache exists for.
//
// TWO EDGES ARE STATED RATHER THAN SOLVED. A file rewritten to the SAME LENGTH
// inside the SAME SECOND is indistinguishable to this rule — the only thing
// that would catch it is a digest, and the engine cannot offer one without
// reading the file it was trying to avoid sending. And when the question does
// not get through at all, the cached bytes ARE served: a link that cannot
// answer a stat cannot answer a fetch either, so refusing would trade a copy
// that is probably right for nothing at all.
//
// ── TWO: THE MIRROR, BECAUSE A VIEWER SHOWS ITS TITLE BAR ───────────────────
//
// A CAS blob is named by its digest, so handing one to `open` puts
// `3f9a…c17b` in somebody's window title and in their recent-files menu. The
// mirror is the same bytes under the name they actually have:
//
//	~/.codeaf/v3/remote/mirror/<host>/<the engine's own path>
//
// It is HARDLINKED from the blob where the filesystem allows it, so the second
// copy costs an inode and no bytes, and copied where it does not (a store and a
// mirror on different devices, which is what happens the moment somebody points
// CODEAF_HOME at another disk). Either way the file is read-only, which is not
// an accident: THE MIRROR IS BYTES TO LOOK AT. Editing it changes nothing on the
// machine that owns the file, this wave has no write-back, and a read-only copy
// is the surface saying so in the one language every editor understands.
//
// ── THREE: THE HANDOFF, AND THE SILENCE AROUND IT ───────────────────────────
//
// The platform opener is opener.go's, unchanged and for its reason: a second
// spelling of "open this" is a second thing to keep in step with the platforms.
//
// THE EMPTINESS LAW OWNS THE WAIT. A fetch that finishes inside
// [remoteOpenQuiet] says NOTHING — a cache hit and a fast link are the same
// experience and neither is news. Past that, one quiet note names the file and
// its weight if the weight is known, and nothing else is drawn: no spinner, no
// progress, no second line when it lands. A failure is the ENGINE'S OWN
// SENTENCE, once — including the refusal for a file over the wire's 16MB
// ceiling, which is passed through exactly as internal/remote spells it, because
// a surface that paraphrased a limit would be a second place that states it.

// remoteOpenedMsg is one open flow finishing, either way.

// openRemotePath is the whole gesture: a path on the engine's disk becomes a
// file this machine's viewer is holding.
