// standByNextDue is the order both bands that list standing things read them in:

// has one, and the rules that never wake at the very end.
//
// A HOLD IS NOT IN THE QUEUE AT ALL, and that is the third tier's whole reason.
// This band's question is "what happens next", and a rule has no next — it is
// simply true, and it will still be true after everything above it has gone off.
// Sorted among the appointments it would take the front of the band on the
// strength of having no appointment, which is soonest-first saying something
// that is not merely uninteresting but false. Behind them it reads as what it
// is: the standing conditions under the schedule. AMONG THEMSELVES THE NEWEST
// LEADS, because the one made this morning is the one somebody is still thinking
// about, and none of them has any other fact to sort on.
//
// It is one function because two bands say it — this one about a project, the
// machine's watchlist about everywhere (homeband_watchlist.go) — and two
// spellings of one order is two things to keep in step.
