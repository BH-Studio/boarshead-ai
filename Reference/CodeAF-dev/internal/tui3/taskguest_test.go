// ── A PAGE READ THROUGH SOMEBODY ELSE'S CONVERSATION ────────────────────────
//
// The tasks place can now open a task that belongs to a conversation the engine
// is running rather than this window ([app.openOwnerRoom]). Two things about
// that page are dangerous rather than merely wrong, and this file holds both.
//
//   - THE IDS COLLIDE. Task ids restart with every conversation, so the page is
//     nearly always standing beside a local task of the same number — a real,
//     healthy piece of work with a different name, a different model and a
//     different state. Every reader on the page goes through [app.roomNode], and
//     every ACTION on it (stop, model, effort, approval, steer) has to be absent
//     rather than aimed at that local row.
//   - THE ATTACH IS A ROUND TRIP. It is made off the program loop, so a person
//     who presses a row and then leaves has an answer arriving for a page they
//     are not on. It must close its own connection and open nothing.
