//	 ⟲ drops 1 turn — everything below the pick is let go
//	 esc close · ↑↓ move · enter picks the point
//
// THERE ARE TWO REWINDS AND THEY ANSWER TWO DIFFERENT QUESTIONS. esc esc opens
// the INLINE mode (rewind.go), which is the quick take-back: the transcript on
// screen is the picker, the answer is almost always "the thing I just said", and
// the whole gesture is over in two keystrokes. This page is the DELIBERATE one —
// "take me back to before we started down this road" — and the question it
// answers cannot be answered by the inline mode at all, because the inline mode
// walks the DRAWN blocks and a resumed conversation draws only its last
// [replayTail] entries. Everything older than that was unreachable.
//
// SO THIS PAGE IS BUILT FROM THE SESSION AND NOT FROM THE SCREEN. Its rows come
// out of [session.Agent.Transcript] and its points out of
// [session.Agent.RewindPoints], both of which cover the WHOLE history — the same
// reading /export already takes for the same reason. Nothing here is matched
// against the drawn block list, so there is no window to fall off the top of.
//
// IT IS THE FOURTH CITIZEN OF THE FRAME-TAKEOVER PATTERN, after the settings
// panel, the task page and home (view.go's [app.frame] draws them in that
// order), and it follows the task page's shape down to the smallest part:
// a state struct, one key handler that owns every key while it is up, one
// function that is both the frame and the pointer's hit map, and a filter that
// every printable key types into.
//
// THE TWO SURFACES SHARE ONE VOCABULARY. The ⟲ glyph, the "drops N turns"
// arithmetic ([rewindDropCount]), the cut itself and everything that happens
// after it ([app.rewindLand] — the rebuild, the note, the message coming back to
// the box) are one implementation with two doors on it. A person who learns the
// quick gesture has already learned this page.
//
// ENTER IS TWO-STAGE, and that is the one place this page deliberately parts
// company with the inline mode. The inline mode is a gesture aimed at a row a
// person is already looking at; this is a list somebody has just scrolled a
// hundred rows through, and a single blind keystroke that drops an hour of
// conversation from a row you have only just arrived at is not a thing this
// surface is going to offer. So the first enter PLACES the pick — the foot
// changes to say what the next one does — and the second one on the same point
// cuts. Moving the cursor takes the arming away again.
