// Image previews are an explicit, low-resolution look at a file. The transcript
// controls live in picturefold.go; this file only resolves and paints pixels.
//
// The renderer uses foreground/background half cells inside the ordinary text
// frame. It needs no graphics overlay lifecycle during scrolling, resizing or
// reconnecting. Full-quality inspection belongs to the original-file action:
// forty pixel rows cannot make a screenshot's text legible on any terminal.
//
// ANSI256 and truecolour terminals can paint the preview. ASCII, screen-reader
// and lower-colour displays retain the same file controls without painted cells.
