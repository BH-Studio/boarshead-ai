// A DOOR THAT PARKED A COMMAND MUST HAVE IT HANDED ON, AND A CLICK IS A DOOR.
//
// [app.press] returns the parked pump for the one press that opens a page
// (harnesscard.go's "change it", which walks into the design's room). The
// keyboard twin of that door — `e`, input.go — already did. The click did not:
// the branch assigned the command to the named result and the function ended in
// `return nil`, so the assignment was dead.
//
// It cost more than the room. [app.openRoom] parks
// `tea.Batch(waitRoom(...), a.wake())`, and [app.wake] sets `a.painting = true`
// as it BUILDS its tick — so dropping that batch left the surface claiming to be
// painting with no frame on the way, and `a.painting` is only ever cleared
// inside [app.paint], which now never runs. Every later `a.wake()` returned nil.
// The frame clock was dead for the rest of the process: no spinners, no
// count-ups, no [app.tickAsk], and streamed text that only appeared when a
// keystroke happened to force a redraw. From in front of it, a session that had
// stopped.
