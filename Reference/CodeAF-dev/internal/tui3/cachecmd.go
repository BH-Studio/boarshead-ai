// CLEANING THE CACHE, AND ASKING IN WORDS.
//
// /cache reads and /cache clean destroys, and the gap between them is guarded
// the way this surface guards everything irreversible — confirmed once, with
// the safe answer as the default (stop.go states the law over ending work).
// Here the confirmation is TYPED rather than a raised card, and the reason is
// what the card exists for: a card keeps a single keystroke from ending
// something, and there is no single keystroke here. The act is reached only by
// writing "/cache clean now" out in full, after the first form has said the
// size, the path, what goes cold, and what is out of reach — which is /quit's
// own argument ("it is typed out on purpose") with the blast radius stated
// first. A bare "/cache clean" always stops at the question; nothing on this
// road deletes anything the first time it is asked.
//
// WHAT "THE CACHE" IS is said out loud in both answers, because the word is
// one people reasonably stretch over their conversations and their dashboard —
// and the only good moment to correct that is before a deletion. This verb
// reaches ~/.codeaf/cache and nothing else; internal/cachedir owns the radius
// for this surface and the CLI both.
