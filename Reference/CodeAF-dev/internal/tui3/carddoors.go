// ── THE CARD'S DOORS, AND THE POINTER ON THEM ───────────────────────────────
//
// THE RIGHT COLUMN HAS DOORS AND NOTHING ON IT SAID SO. A fold line opens the
// band it is the foot of, and a work row opens that task's record — both of
// them presses a person can make and neither of them a thing the card drew any
// differently from the sentences around it. On a terminal that is worse than on
// a page: there is no underline, no cursor change, no affordance at all except
// the one the surface paints, so a card whose doors look exactly like its prose
// is a card that hides every door it has. The owner met it as a task row that
// opened a record when pressed and lit nothing when pointed at.
//
// So the line under the pointer takes THE GROUND LADDER'S CURSOR STEP
// ([palette.cursor], styles.go — the same background the left column's hovered
// row wears, and the same one every list, page and card on this surface lights
// with through [app.hoverRow]). One ink for "the pointer is here", everywhere.
//
// AND WHAT LIGHTS IS EXACTLY WHAT A PRESS ACTS ON, which is hover.go's law and
// the reason this file holds ONE registry rather than two. The fold lines and
// the work rows used to be recorded separately — a fold registry for
// [app.bandFoldAt] and a task registry for [app.cardTaskAt] — and a hover built
// on top of that would have been a third and a fourth ad-hoc map, drifting away
// from the press one wave at a time. There is one list of what the card painted
// that a press acts on; the press reads it by KIND, and the pointer reads it
// whole. A line the card draws that answers nothing — `▸ 3 more tasks`, which
// names the tasks place instead of opening (place_home.go's [app.homeCardWork])
// — records no door and therefore lights not at all, which is the useful half:
// a hover style everything wears says nothing about what can be pressed.
//
// AND THE DOORS ARE RECORDED BY THE DRAW. The card is assembled band by band,
// drops whole bands on a short frame and folds its own work rows at
// [homeCardTasks], so a row number computed a second time would name a different
// row exactly when a person could not tell why. The registry is written where
// the fold has already decided what is on the frame, and it dies with the frame
// that wrote it.

// cardDoorKind is what a door on the card DOES when it is pressed. It is the
// one thing the two kinds do not share, which is why the registry carries it
// rather than splitting in two.

// (hometree.go), so `└─ ✓ Port the Picker` holds `✓ Port the Picker` — and a
// first-match scan handed a click on the CHILD row the parent's record, which is
// the one failure a pointer must not have. The longest text that fits a line is
// the row that line actually is: a shorter door only ever matches by accident,
