// THE FILES ON THE OTHER MACHINE, AS THINGS THIS ONE CAN OPEN.
//
// A hosted session's workspace is on somebody else's disk, and until this file
// existed that was the end of the sentence: pathlink.go turned linking off
// entirely over a connection (its own header says why, and it was right to),
// /files listed what THIS laptop had made, and a picture the model produced was
// a path nobody sitting here could reach. The conversation crossed the wire and
// the things it made did not.
//
// ── THE HONESTY RULE IS UNCHANGED; ONLY WHO ANSWERS IT MOVED ────────────────
//
// pathlink.go's law is that NOTHING BECOMES A LINK UNTIL IT HAS BEEN FOUND ON
// DISK, and the stat is what decides. Over a connection the disk is the
// engine's, so the stat is the engine's too: [remote.Client.StatPaths] is the
// same question asked over the wire, answered under the same two-roots law
// [remote.handOver] applies to everything else that crosses (internal/remote's
// file.go). A word the engine did not confirm stays plain text, exactly as a
// word this machine could not stat stays plain text at home.
//
// ── ONE CALL PER BURST, NEVER ONE PER WORD ──────────────────────────────────
//
// A stat at home is a syscall and costs nothing worth counting. A stat over an
// ssh pipe is a round trip, and a paragraph of prose can hold thirty pathish
// words — so the render pass COLLECTS candidates ([remoteFiles.confirm]) and
// the frame clock sends them in one batch of at most [statBatchMax], which is
// internal/remote's own statPathsMax and the number over which the engine
// refuses the call rather than trimming it silently.
//
// THE BATCH IS ASKED OFF THE RENDER PATH, as a tea.Cmd, because a frame that
// waited on a wire would be a surface that froze every time the model named a
// file. Nothing links on the frame the word first appears; the answer arrives,
// the rows are marked stale, and the same words are doors on the next frame.
// That is the same one-frame lateness the local pass has when a turn's last
// tool call creates the file its first sentence named.
//
// A YES IS ASKED ONCE PER SESSION AND A NO IS NOT. The local memo is emptied at
// every turn boundary (app.settle's clear of pathSeen) because a name that was
// not a file may have become one, and this table cannot be emptied that way —
// doing it would put every word in the transcript back on the wire once a turn.
// So the two answers are kept on different terms: a CONFIRMED path never
// changes its mind about being a path and is remembered for the session, while
// an ABSENT one is stamped with the moment it was answered and asked again
// after [remoteAbsentFor]. "I'll write dist/app" is a sentence the model says
// BEFORE the file exists, and a table with no expiry is a table in which that
// word is plain text for the rest of the conversation no matter what gets
// built. [app.prefetchWritten] catches the common case sooner — the model
// writing a file is the event that makes a plain word a door — but it only sees
// the `write` tool, and a file that appeared under `bash` or under a task has
// nothing but the clock to find it.
//
// ── THE LINK IS A CAPABILITY, NOT A PATH ────────────────────────────────────
//
// A confirmed file's anchor points at the door's /o/<id> and never at file://,
// for the reason pathlink.go turned links off in the first place:
// `file:///app/main.go` handed to the terminal in front of you means THIS
// machine's /app/main.go, which is either nothing or a stranger's file. The
// door is a loopback listener this surface owns, its ids are minted per path
// and die with it, and every byte it serves came back through [Source.Fetch] —
// which is the engine's law speaking (internal/filedoor's header).
//
// A CONFIRMED DIRECTORY IS NOT LINKED in this wave. The door serves one file
// per id; a directory would need the browse page pointed at it, and pointing
// somebody at a listing when they clicked a folder name is a different gesture
// than the one this pass is about.
//
// ── THE DOOR OPENS ON FIRST NEED AND NOT BEFORE ─────────────────────────────
//
// A healthy hosted session that never names a file runs no listener at all: the
// door is opened by the first confirmed link, the first prefetch, or the first
// /files, and closed with the surface ([app.quit]). It is a capability that
// costs a port and a goroutine, and a conversation that has no use for one
// should not be paying.
//
// ── THE ONE WRITE, AND WHY IT IS SILENT ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// Everything above reads. The browse page's drag-drop lane is the single thing
// on this seam that puts a byte on the far machine, and what bounds it is not
// this surface's good behavior: [remote.MethodDepositFile] lands a file in that
// session's attachments/ folder and has no argument for a directory, so there
// is no path this side could name even if it wanted one. It opens NO TURN,
// which is the whole reason it is a door of its own rather than SubmitFiles —
// [hostSource.Deposit] says the rest.

	// one is what a person may ASK for and wait on; this one is what the surface
	// spends on a click that has not happened yet. Two megabytes covers the
	// things a model actually writes — a source file, a CSV, a chart, a page of

	// out on ONE ssh pipe, ahead of a click nobody has made, in front of the
	// frames and the fetches somebody is actually waiting on. Three at a time
	// keeps the pipe busy without owning it.
	//
	// LIVE SPECULATIVE WRITES THAT DO NOT FIT ARE DROPPED RATHER THAN QUEUED. A
