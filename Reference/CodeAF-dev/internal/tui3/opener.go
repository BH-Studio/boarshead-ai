// THE TWO WAYS A LINK LEAVES THIS SURFACE.
//
// A sign-in finishes in a browser, and a terminal has two honest ways to get a
// person there:
//
//   - HAND IT TO THE PLATFORM. `open` on a Mac, `xdg-open` on Linux: the same
//     port internal/tui already makes (its clipboard.go), because a second
//     spelling of "open this" is a second thing to keep in step with the
//     platforms.
//   - WRITE IT DOWN. The link is drawn as text, always, whether or not the
//     handoff worked — and the text is wrapped in OSC 8 where the sequence is
//     safe, so a terminal that understands hyperlinks makes it clickable and one
//     that does not shows exactly the characters a person can select and copy.
//     THIS IS THE SSH CASE and it is not an edge: a browser opened on the far
//     end of a connection is a browser nobody is sitting at.
//
// Neither of them is trusted with the other's job. The handoff can fail on a
// headless box and the link stays; the link can be unclickable and the browser
// still opened. What must never happen is a sign-in a person cannot reach.

// processOpener is where this file reaches out of the program. It is a variable
// so a test can watch what would have been opened without a browser appearing
// on the machine running it — the same seam, and the same reason, as
// internal/tui's.
var processOpener = opener.Start

// setupBrowserWord shares the terminal connection command's recovery line, so
// a browser start failure has one spelling wherever the visible link lives.
const setupBrowserWord = opener.BrowserFailureWord

// openerCommand is what this platform calls "open this". An empty name is a
// platform with no answer, which is a fact the caller reports rather than
// papers over.
func openerCommand() (string, []string) {
	return opener.Command()
}

// startOpener hands the target to the platform and does not wait for whatever
// opens it: a browser left open must not hold a goroutine here.
//
// THE NAME IS RESOLVED HERE AND THE PROCESS IS STARTED ELSEWHERE. Six doors call
// this from the update loop on a keystroke — ctrl+o, `o open folder`, /connect,
// the first-run sign-in, /files — and every one of them chooses its sentence from
// the error on the frame that needs it. exec.Command looks the opener up on PATH
// and records a miss in command.Err WITHOUT STARTING ANYTHING, and that miss is
// the answer those doors act on: no `xdg-open` on a headless box. Start forks
// synchronously so a browser that would not start is reported on that frame,
// then waits for the child off the loop. A child that later fails is a link that
// did not open, which is the case the link written under every handoff exists
// for.

// oscURIMax is the longest link this surface will put inside an OSC 8. It is
// internal/tui2's number, and it is a bound on the SEQUENCE rather than a
// judgement about links: an escape sequence a terminal decides is too long is a
// sequence it may print instead of consume.
const oscURIMax = 2048

// oscSafeURI reports whether a link may go inside an OSC 8.
//
// It is a yes or a no and never a repair. A link whose target we had to edit is
// a link that points somewhere other than where the caller said, which is the
// exact failure OSC 8 spoofing is about — so a no renders as plain text, which
// is what every caller here draws anyway.

// linkOpen is the sequence that starts an anchor, or the empty string when the
// link may not be written — which is the caller's signal to draw plain text and

// that a person actually sees: everything after it, to the end of the screen,
// becomes one link.

// linkify wraps a label as a hyperlink to uri, and returns the label untouched
// when the sequence would not be safe.

// A hyperlink occupies no cells, so a caller that has already fitted its label
// to a width does not have to measure again — which is the whole reason this is
// applied last, to text the layout has finished with.
