// on the arrow keys and on every hover that moved the card. It was already off
// the draw and already behind a five-second cache, which is why it read as
// correct; what neither of those bounds is the WALL. The command was given a
// whole second of ceiling, and a repository big enough to need it is a
// repository a person browsing home meets on their first `↓` — measured at 7.7ms
// on codeaf's own worktree, and seconds on a cold cache or a network mount, with
// every key and every motion queued behind it. It is exactly the fault
// reasoninglevel.go took off the pointer's way over a connection, made locally.
//
// So the reading is ASKED FOR here and ANSWERED in [app.tookHomeRepo], and the
// card draws the last one it was given (homeband_repo.go's [drawRepoBand] reads
// the cache and never the disk). A workspace nobody has read yet simply has no
// branch clause on its place line for one frame, which is the emptiness law and
// not a blank.

// down twenty rows of one project would fork twenty gits at the same repository,
