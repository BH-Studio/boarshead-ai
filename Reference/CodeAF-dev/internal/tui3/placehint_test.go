// ── A PLACE THAT DOES NOT SAY ITS OWN KEYS IS LYING WITH SOMEBODY ELSE'S ─────
//
// The search place had no `hint` of its own, so the router's default answered
// for it and its foot read `enter talk about it · alt+enter send it off as a
// task · alt+. for the map · tab next place` — six rows under the place's own
// body saying `enter opens the conversation at the matching turn.`, which is
// also what the manual says (places.md's search section). The spend place had
// the identical hole and hid `enter`, `→ b the limits` and its shift-arrow
// window behind the same wrong sentence.
//
// The seam was the default, not the two symptoms. [placeBase] no longer carries
// a `hint`, so a place without one does not compile — and this test says the
// same thing a second time, by name, so that a default quietly restored is
// caught by a failure message rather than by somebody eventually reading a
// frame.
