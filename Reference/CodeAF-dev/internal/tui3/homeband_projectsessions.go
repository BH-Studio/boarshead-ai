// THE PROJECT CARD'S FIRST BAND: THE CONVERSATIONS THIS PROJECT HOLDS.
//
// The cursor on a project is a person asking a different question from the one
// they ask on a conversation. On a conversation the question is "what is this
// doing"; on a project it is "what is going on in here" — and the only honest
// answer to that is the list of conversations, in the order home already puts
// them in.
//
// SO THE ROWS ARE THE LEFT COLUMN'S OWN ROWS, drawn again at the card's width.
// The glyph is [homeGlyph], the name is [homeName], the tail is [homeNote] —
// the same three functions the row across the gutter is made of, so a
// conversation cannot be called one thing on the left and another on the right.
// What this band does NOT do is invent an order: [session.Project.Sessions]
// arrives in triage order from the world's own reader (session's sortSessions:
// needs-you, running, incomplete, then recency), which is exactly the order
// [homeView.buildWorld] draws them in with nothing typed. A second ladder here
// would be the same judgement made twice, and the two would drift.
//
// AND IT FOLDS AT [homeShown], which is the count the left column folds at. A
// project with forty conversations is not a card with forty rows on it — the
// card is a glance, the fold is the door, and the number on the door is the
// same number the project's own tail line uses.

// line is about its real PATH, and the two are different strings for one
// directory (session's world.go: the bucket name is an encoding of the path and

// — a project nothing recorded a path for has only its name, and answering
// nothing for it would blank the card of the very projects that need it most.
