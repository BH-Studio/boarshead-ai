// promotion, which is the only part of the block that is still growing — is

// history without a single glyph changing.

// asserted once, in [TestTheLiveTierIsTheReadingLaddersStepAboveTheBody], where
// it can be read beside the body ink it is defined against; everything else
// asks the palette what it would paint, so a retune of either tier moves one
// line in styles.go and no line here.
