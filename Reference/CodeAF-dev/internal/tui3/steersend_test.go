// THE SEND LEAVES THE EVENT LOOP, AND EVERYTHING BELOW IS WHAT THAT COSTS IF IT
// IS DONE CARELESSLY.
//
// A crossing that takes ten seconds must not take the keyboard with it; an
// answer that arrives after the person has walked into another task must not
// paint there; a correction queued behind another must cross to the engine it
// was typed at and not to whatever is answering when it is released; and a send
// nobody answered must stay a SEND — with the name it already has — because a
// sentence handed back to the box takes a new name on the next enter and can
// then be delivered twice.
