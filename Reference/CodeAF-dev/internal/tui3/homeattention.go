// THE ATTENTION RULES — WHICH ARE THE SORT ORDER NOW.
//
// Home's left column used to carry TWO STRIPS over the list: `needs you` and
// `moving`, each gathering the same conversations, items and errands the list
// below it already held, each with its own label, teaching line, fold and mark.
// At the widest tier they left the list entirely and took a column of their own.
//
// THEY ARE GONE, AND WHAT THEY WERE FOR IS NOT. A summary standing over a list
// earns its cells when the list is in a different order — a project tree sorted
// by project genuinely cannot answer "what needs me". The list is one flat
// ranked list now (SCREEN 1a, place_home.go), and what it is ranked BY is
// exactly what the two strips gathered: needs-you first, then moving, then
// quiet. A strip over that list is the same reading twice, and every row it held
// was already one row further down the screen.
//
// So what survives here is the RULES, and every one of them is now read by
// [readSwitcher] instead of by a strip:
//
//   - NEEDS-YOU ORDER IS WAITED-LONGEST FIRST ([attentionOlder],
//     [attentionWaitedSince]). It is the only order that cannot be argued with:
//     the thing that has been stopped longest has cost the most already. THE
//     DESTRUCTIVE PIN IS STILL NOT BUILT — see [attentionWaitedSince].
//   - MOVING IS BUSIEST FIRST, OLDEST WITHIN A TIER ([attentionMovingSince]).
//   - AN UNKNOWN STAMP GOES LAST and never to the top of a list ordered by how
//     long something has been standing still.
//
// EVERY FACT IS ONE HOME ALREADY READ. The world, the standing bands and the
// errands are the same three readings the list is built from, on the same
// three-second beat ([homeEvery]). This file opens nothing, stats nothing and
// asks the engine for nothing.

// attentionWaitedSince is when a conversation's question was put.
//
// [session.PresenceQuestion.Asked] is the stamp the session that is waiting
// wrote, which is exactly the fact this rank sorts on. A window on an older
// build, or a lane whose question describes no card, records none — and the
// fallback is when the PERSON LAST SPOKE, which is not the wait but is a bound
// on it: the question came after they spoke, so the row can never claim to have
// waited longer than it has.
//
// ── AND THE DESTRUCTIVE PIN IS NOT BUILT ────────────────────────────────────
//
// The design asks for one exception to waited-longest-first: a consent card for
// something DESTRUCTIVE pins to the top for as long as it waits. Nothing on this
// machine can say which one that is. The classification exists — internal/
// approval's critical-command table, [approval.AlwaysAsks] — but it never
// reaches a question: [session.PresenceQuestion] carries a kind, an id, the
// options and the line `needs your ok to run bash`, which is the TOOL's name and
// not the command's text (session's consent.go). So this surface could only
// guess, and a pin that guessed would put a `rm -rf` row and a `git status` row
// in the same place at the top of the one list a person trusts.
//
// A CAPABILITY THAT CANNOT WORK IS ABSENT, NOT BROKEN. The pin lands the day the
// engine writes the fact down, and not before.

// A TURN A WAKE STARTED IS OLDER THAN ITS AGE SAYS. Nothing records when such a
