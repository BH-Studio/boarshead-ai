// WHERE THE FOLDERS COME FROM, AND WHAT IT COSTS TO ASK.
//
// foldersearch.go ranks what is already known; this file is the other half of
// the same question — HOW THE THINGS TO RANK ARE FOUND, and how a directory is
// read without a keystroke waiting for a disk.
//
// Three laws run through all of it, and they are the three the folder picker
// has been getting wrong:
//
//   - A DIRECTORY THAT CANNOT BE READ IS NOT AN EMPTY DIRECTORY. `os.ReadDir`
//     answers a permission with `nil, err`, and a caller that drops the error
//     tells somebody their work is gone. [folderReadDir] hands the error back
//     and [folderReadWord] is the sentence to draw instead of the rows.
//   - NOTHING ON A KEYSTROKE TOUCHES A DISK. Every read here is a [tea.Cmd],
//     stamped with the generation that asked for it, and an answer whose
//     generation is behind the surface's is an answer to a question nobody is
//     asking any more ([folderStale]).
//   - DISCOVERY IS BOUNDED BEFORE IT IS STARTED. A walk takes a depth, a cap
//     and a wall-clock budget, it says whether it stopped on one of them, and
//     it says how many directories it was refused. A background walk that
//     quietly gave up is indistinguishable from a machine with nothing on it.
//
// AND NOTHING HERE OPENS A FILE. This is a folder chooser: the names of the
// directories and one stat for a `.git` is the whole of what it may know. A
// content index would be a different feature with a different cost, and the
// design's ruling on it is that it is not this one.
