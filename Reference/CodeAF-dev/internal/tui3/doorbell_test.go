// ── THE DOORBELL'S LAWS (doorbell.go) ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// They are counts and outcomes, never stopwatches (PERF.md: gate on work, never
// on time). The defect they guard was binary — the answer came back, or the wire
// gave up on it ten seconds later — so the laws are binary too, and the one
// figure worth knowing is logged rather than gated on.

// answerWakesTheTurn is an engine on a real pipe that answers every call at
// once, except that its answer to a question is preceded by a "phase" frame —
// the turn that answer woke, saying it is connecting. That is the real engine's
// order: the turn's goroutine gets its news out before the dispatch goroutine
// gets its result out, and it is the order that deadlocked the window.
