// ── CONTINUING A CONVERSATION IN ANOTHER TERMINAL ───────────────────────────
//
// A conversation lives inside the process of the terminal that opened it, under
// a flock nothing else can take. A second terminal used to meet that lock and be
// told to go away — `open in another window — go there, or start a new
// conversation here` — which is a true sentence and the wrong answer to what a
// person actually wants: they are AT the second terminal, and the first one is
// upstairs, or on a laptop that is shut, or simply behind eleven other windows.
//
// So the conversation MOVES, and there are TWO ROADS to that because there are
// two kinds of holder.
//
// ── THE ENGINE ROAD, WHICH IS THE ORDINARY ONE ──────────────────────────────
//
// A plain `codeaf chat` runs its conversation in the workspace's ENGINE
// (internal/enginehost), and the engine is what holds the journal. So the second
// terminal does not have to ask anybody for anything: it opens the conversation
// through the same engine, which hands back the session it is already running —
// mid-turn, in well under a second, with the work still moving. The window it
// left is told by the engine ([session.EventMoved]) and STEPS BACK: it detaches,
// says where the conversation went, and lands on home with that row under the
// cursor, so one enter brings it back. Nothing is interrupted, nothing pauses,
// and no keystroke is spent on a confirmation — the whole of what a move costs
// is one enter to undo it. [app.movedAway] is that half.
//
// ── THE IN-PROCESS ROAD, WHICH IS WHAT IS LEFT ──────────────────────────────
//
// A window with no engine behind it (`--no-host`, `--debug`, a test) holds the
// journal in its own process, and nothing outside that process can join it. That
// is what the rest of this file is: a request on the disk, a holder that lets go,
// and a window waiting on the flock. It ASKS FIRST because it really does END the
// other window, and the work there pauses for a moment and resumes here.
//
// The in-process road has three sides:
//
//	the asking side   home. Enter on a held row raises a confirmation on home's
//	                  own card (homeconfirm.go) — `Move this conversation here?`,
//	                  cursor on `leave it there` — and answering `move it here`
//	                  writes the request ([session.AskTakeover]) and waits on the
//	                  flock. When the lock frees, the row opens by the ordinary
//	                  door.
//	the holder        the window that has it. It hears [session.EventTakeover]
//	                  on the standing lane — the one subscription that outlives
//	                  every turn — and lets go the way /new lets go: interrupt,
//	                  close, land on whatever else this window was holding.
//	the launch        `codeaf chat` in a folder whose conversation is open
//	                  somewhere else comes up on home with that row's question
//	                  already asked ([Options.TakeOver]).
//
// ── THE FOUR THINGS THIS DESIGN PROMISES ───────────────────────────────────
//
//   - IT IS ANSWERED AT THE NEXT HEARTBEAT, mid-reply or not. It used to wait
//     for the holder's running turn to end, and that wait was the defect this
//     road was reported for — `coming here · 4m50s` while a long reply finished
//     out of sight. The holder interrupts and closes the way /new does, which
//     leaves its work `paused — it resumes` and its partial reply in the
//     journal, and the window that asked picks both up.
//   - NOTHING IS DECIDED BY ONE KEYSTROKE. Enter raises the question; the answer
//     under the cursor is `leave it there`, so a person walking a list with enter
//     cannot end another window with it. Moving it is `1` or `→` — which move the
//     cursor and answer nothing — and then enter. Anything that moves the cursor
//     off the row takes the question down.
//   - THE WORK COMES WITH IT. Tasks land `paused — it resumes` when the holder
//     closes, and the window that takes the conversation resumes them from the
//     checkpoint. The unsent sentence comes too, through the draft file.
//   - AND IT IS A LOCAL FACT. Over --host the holder is a window on this laptop
//     and the journal is on the far machine; there is nobody to ask, so home
//     keeps [sessionBusyWord] there and says nothing about moving anything.

// takeoverAskWord is the question itself, and it is a QUESTION rather than an
// instruction: what the first enter raises is a confirmation on home's own card
// (homeconfirm.go), answered the way every confirmation on this surface is.
//
// It used to be a sentence on the foot line — `enter again to move it here (that
// window's reply stops there; its tasks resume here)` — thirty rows from the row
// it was about, and the second enter was the answer. A person leaning on enter
// down a list of conversations ended another window with a key they press to
// make things go away; the card puts the cursor on the answer that loses
// nothing instead, which is stop.go's law and now this door's.
const takeoverAskWord = "Move this conversation here?"

// takeoverMoveWord and takeoverStayWord are the two answers, and
// [takeoverStayWord] is the one marked [session.AnswerOption.Safe] — the cursor

//
// IT STATES THE COST BEFORE THE KEY IS PRESSED. Two things are surprising about
// this door and both are here: the other window's reply stops where it is, and
// the work running over there comes here rather than stopping.
//
// IT IS THE REASON ROW BECAUSE HOME'S CARD IS FIFTY COLUMNS. A consequence
// stands in a column beside its answer and is cut at the card's right edge —
// which on this card left `its reply stops there; i…` — and the reason has the
// row to itself. The other thing that row could have said is where the
// conversation is, and that is already on the line above it and in the row's own
// margin: the same sentence twice is what this block exists to end.
