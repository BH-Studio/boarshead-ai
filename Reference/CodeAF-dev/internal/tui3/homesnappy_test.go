// ── WHAT A KEY AND A POINTER ON HOME MAY COST ───────────────────────────────
//
// These are PERF.md's laws about this screen, and they are COUNTS rather than
// stopwatches for the reason that file's doctrine gives: a count is a fact about
// the code and the same fact on a loaded laptop as on idle CI.
//
// WHAT THEY WERE WRITTEN AFTER. The owner reported that "when I hover or go up
// and down in home it's very laggy, I think it has something to do with git".
// Three separate things were true, and the guess was one of them:
//
//   - the deliverables index was read and parsed inside a draw (fixed one commit
//     earlier, pinned by [TestTheDeliverablesIndexIsReadOnceForTheWholeScreen]);
//   - `git status` ran ON THE UPDATE LOOP, on every arrow key and every hover
//     that moved the card, with a one-second ceiling on it;
//   - and every answered pointer motion built TWO whole home frames — one for
//     [app.homeHover] to hit-test against, and one for the repaint it asked for.
//
// Measured on a lab of eight repositories that answer `git status` in ten
// milliseconds each, which is what a real worktree costs (codeaf's own is 7.7ms
// warm) and a tenth of what a cold or mounted one costs:
//
//	                    before          after
//	twenty arrivals     1.14ms each     0.048ms each   worst 10.4ms -> 0.10ms
//	sixty motions       0.57ms each     0.116ms each   worst 10.8ms -> 0.79ms
//	git on the loop     3 commands      0
//	frames per motion   2               1
//
// The commands still run — they are ASKED FOR and come back as messages
// (homecardread.go) — so nothing on the card is less true than it was; what
// changed is which goroutine waits for them.

// snappyLab is a home whose conversations live in eight different repositories,
// with a `git status` that counts itself and takes as long as a real one.
//
// EIGHT IS THE POINT. One repository would be answered once and cached
// ([homeRepoTTL]), and the fault being pinned here is a person walking rows that
// belong to different projects — which is what home's resting list IS.
