// ANSWER THE QUESTION WITHOUT OPENING THE WINDOW IT IS IN.
//
// Home already says which conversation is stopped on somebody: the row wears
// `▲`, sorts to the top of its project, and the state band spells out the one
// line it is stopped on (homebands.go's [drawStateBand]). Up to here that is a
// SIGN POST — it tells you where to walk. This band is the other half: the
// answers the card in that window is offering, under the line it is asking, as
// chips a digit or a click gives.
//
// ── WHY IT IS WORTH DOING AT ALL ──
//
// The whole cost of a question in another terminal is the walk: find the window,
// read the card back from the top because you have lost the thread of it, answer
// three keys' worth of it, walk back. The answer itself was never the work. A
// person glancing at home already has the one line in front of them — that line
// is what the card leads with too — and for `allow once`, `yes` and `deny` there
// is nothing more to know. So those go here, and everything that needs more of
// the card than one line stays in the window that has the card.
//
// ── THE FOUR LAWS ──
//
//   - IT DRAWS WHAT THE SESSION OFFERED, NEVER WHAT THIS BUILD KNOWS. The chips
//     come off [session.PresenceQuestion.Options], written by the session that
//     is waiting, so this surface can never advertise a key that session would
//     drop (answers.go states the same law from the writing end).
//
//   - IT NEVER REPEATS THE QUESTION. The line the session is stopped on is the
//     state band's, one row above, in ink. Printing it again here would be the
//     same sentence twice in the same colour on one small card — and home's
//     density is omission, never repetition. This band is the ANSWERS.
//
//   - A STALE WINDOW IS NOT ANSWERED. Every key and every click asks
//     [session.SessionPresence.Fresh] again, at the instant of the press and not
//     at the instant of the last reading: a window killed with a card on screen
//     leaves a file claiming a question nobody is waiting for, and an answer
//     sent into it would be a keystroke that quietly did nothing.
//
//   - THE ANSWER IS NOT THE ACT. Home leaves the answer on the other session's
//     doorstep and that session applies it on its own beat (answers.go), which
//     is a second or two later. So the band says `answered · waiting for it to
//     pick that up` until the question stops being in that session's presence,
//     which is the only proof this surface will ever have that it landed.
