// AN UNSENT LINE OUTLIVES THE WINDOW, AND IT COMES BACK TO THE READER IT WAS
// WRITTEN FOR.
//
// draft.go states the older half of this law — the half-written message belongs
// to the person — and it kept exactly one sentence: the conversation's, in a
// plain file. Everything else the composer holds died with the process: the
// correction half-typed at task 7, the document behind `[paste 1 · 42 lines]`,
// the screenshot on the tray.
//
// ── ONE RECORD, AND A PLAIN FILE BESIDE IT ──
//
//	draft-<hash>-<n>-<pid>.json   THE RECORD. Every recipient's composer: its
//	                              words, its caret, the documents behind its
//	                              compact tokens, its tray and its uncertain
//	                              messages. It is what a restore reads.
//	draft-<hash>-<n>-<pid>.txt    the conversation's words, and nothing else. It
//	                              is an EXPORT: a build that has never heard of
//	                              the record reads and writes it exactly as it
//	                              always did, and a person who finds one in a
//	                              directory can read their own sentence in it.
//
// The record is authoritative and is written FIRST, atomically, so it is always
// a whole snapshot of one moment. A crash between the two leaves the plain file
// one save behind, which costs nothing here — a restore that finds a record does
// not read it — and keeps an older build's reading honest.
//
// THE PLAIN FILE IS READ ONLY WHERE NO RECORD SPEAKS FOR THIS CONVERSATION: an
// older window's leftovers, or an orphan adopted from a dead window on this
// directory ([app.legacyDraftText]). Those words come over ALONE — no documents,
// no tray, no task pages — because a record beside a stranger's sentence belongs
// to a stranger's conversation.
//
// AND A RECORD THAT SPEAKS FOR THIS CONVERSATION AND SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THE BOX
// IS SAYING THE BOX IS EMPTY. That is why an empty record is kept rather than
// deleted ([draftKeep.forgettable]) and why the fallback above is not reached
// once one has been found: a crash between the record and the export leaves the
// export holding the sentence the record has just spent, and believing it hands
// back a message the person watched leave.
//
// ── WHOSE LINE IS IT ──
//
// The conversation's sentence follows the DIRECTORY, as it always has: an orphan
// left by a dead window is adopted by the next window opened there (draft.go's
// [adoptDraft]).
//
// EVERYTHING IN THE RECORD FOLLOWS THE CONVERSATION AND NOTHING ELSE. `task 7`
// names a node inside one graph; the same three characters in the next
// conversation are a different piece of work. So every slot carries its OWNER —
// the machine, the project and the transcript ([draftOwnerOf]) — and a slot is
// laid out only where that matches exactly. A slot belonging to somebody else,
// or to nobody this build can name, is left exactly as it was found: never
// shown, never deleted, and picked up by the window that opens that conversation
// again ([app.reuniteDrafts]).
//
// ── NOTHING IS LOST QUIETLY ──
//
// There is no ceiling and no truncation: what the person typed is what is
// written. A write that fails says so ([draftKeepFailWord]) rather than
// pretending. A record this build cannot read is moved aside before anything
