// ── WHERE THE TERMINAL'S OWN CURSOR SITS ────────────────────────────────────
//
// The frame hands view.go one row and one column, view.go hands them to the
// terminal as a tea.Cursor, and the renderer parks the hardware cursor there
// after the frame flushes (view.go's [app.View], bubbletea's cursed renderer).
// Every test in this file pins that park against a frame it can see: the caret
// lands on the line of the box the person is typing into, immediately after
// the words they have typed. A caret anywhere else — one row above the box, in
// the divider's legend, in a resting sentence at the foot — is a cursor
// blinking in a box that is not the one the words are landing in.

// caretRowOf finds the one row the box is drawn on: the typed words are on
// it and the box's own prompt leads it. The words alone do not name the row —
// a settings description can quote a word of the query ("no provider will
// take the request"), and the foot's key line can quote the box's whole
// hint — so the row is told by its prompt, which no other row on the frame
// leads with.
