package tui3

// THE CONTEXT CHOOSER, AS A SHEET THAT OWNS THE SCREEN.
//
// `/folder`, `/place`, `/dir` and a bare `/attach` all open ONE chooser, and
// from this wave it is a real modal: a bounded, framed sheet drawn over a faded
// conversation, holding the keyboard and every pointer event until it is
// answered or cancelled.
//
// ── WHAT THIS REPLACED, AND WHY ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The browser used to be BOTTOM CHROME. [app.overlayHeight] answered the
// picker's want and view.go appended its rows between the draft and the status
// line, the same slot the model picker and the command list live in. On a
// two-hundred-column terminal that meant a column of folder names with a
// hundred cells of dead space beside it, the previous turn's error line still on
// screen above it, no framing of any kind, and nothing to say a chooser had
// opened at all — the conversation simply grew a list. The owner's own word for
// it was that they expected to have opened something.
//
// So the chooser is now what every other deliberate surface in this package is:
// a frame taken WHOLE at the top of [app.frameBody], beside the places, the
// rewind timeline and the status sheet. It differs from those four in one way,
// and the difference is the point — they REPLACE the conversation and this one
// COVERS it. The chat frame is composed exactly as it would have been and then
// faded to the depth ladder's faintest stop, so a person choosing a folder can
// still see the message they were part way through writing, and cannot touch it.
//

// Everything between the breadcrumb and the action row is folderpick.go's own
// [folderPick.rows], unchanged: this file does not draw a second browser, it
// frames the one that already exists. What it adds is the title, the location,
// the box in a place of its own, the framing, and one explicit CANCEL target on
// the foot rule — because a modal whose only way out is a key nobody was told
// about is a modal people get stuck in.
//
// ── ONE HIT MAP ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// [contextWin] is what the last paint put on the SCREEN, and it is the only
// answer the pointer gets. Press, hover, wheel and the terminal's own caret all
// resolve through it, so what lights, what a press acts on and where the cursor
// blinks cannot be three different opinions about where the sheet is. Inside it
// the rows are folderpick.go's own row numbers and the columns are its own
// cells, so [folderGeom] keeps working exactly as it did — there is one layout
// and this file merely says where on the screen it landed.
//
// A press ANYWHERE while the sheet is up is the sheet's press. Outside the box
// it does nothing at all: it may not reach the conversation, the tab bar or an
// action underneath, and it does not dismiss either — a sheet holding four
// chosen things must not throw them away because somebody's aim was off. The
// two ways out are `esc` and the cancel target, and both are named on the sheet.
