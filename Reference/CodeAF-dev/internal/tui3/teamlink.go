// ── TEAM REFERENCES IN A CHAT ARE DOORS ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// A conversation in a team talks about its team all the time: the manager's
// replies name members (`@security has the branch`), a member's card says who
// wrote to it (`◆ manager → @gravity`), a tool call names who it is for
// (`team_send @milestones`). Every one of those names a conversation a person
// may want to look at, so every one of them is a link, exactly as a task
// reference is (markdown.go's [linkifyTasks]): the same pass over rendered rows,
// the same columns recorded on the row, the same click resolved by column
// before the row's own answer, and the same hover held as (block, ordinal).
//
// WHAT IS A LINK IS DECIDED FROM MEMORY AND NEVER GUESSED. An `@word` is a
// link only when it is the handle of a member of a team this conversation is
// in ([app.wall.teams], loaded at an opening; the frame reads no disk). Any
// other `@word` stays exactly as the model wrote it: a link that opens nothing
// is the surface claiming a door it does not have. A team's name is a link only
// where it is written AS a team, `team test`, `the test team` or `"test"`,
// because a team named `test` is also an ordinary word.
//
// A PRESS ON A MEMBER OPENS IT, and resumes it first when this window does not
// have it open, through the strip's own door ([app.tabGo]). A press on a team
// opens the teams page with that team selected: the rail's cursor on its row,
// the pane showing it, and the keyboard left on that row rather than moved
// into the pane. A closed team is selected inside `Closed`, and that fold is
// opened so the row is there. Over --host against an engine without the teams
// doors ([app.teamsOff]) the page cannot open, so the press still opens the
// conversations view on that team, and the hint says that rather than the
// page. A member's hint names the title: `Open @security · santosh dev2
// branch… · click`.
//
// THE HOVER IS A GROUND, as every other control on this surface answers the
// pointer, and not the task link's brightening: the owner's bar is that
// everything clickable has a hover ground.
//
// THE ORDINALS ARE THE TASK LINKS' OWN SPACE, offset by [teamLinkOrd]. A block
// numbers its task references from zero across its rows; its team references
// are numbered from teamLinkOrd, so one hover state holds either and neither
// pass can light the other's link.

// teamLinkOrd is the first ordinal a block's team references take.
