// CHOOSING, AND THE ONE PLACE IT HAPPENS.
//
// folderpick.go browses. This file is the other half of the owner's law that
// NAVIGATING AND CHOOSING ARE TWO DIFFERENT ACTS: moving the cursor, opening a
// row, turning the wheel and reading a preview change nothing about the
// conversation, and the only gesture that does is the action row — `enter`, or a
// click on the row that says in words what it is about to do.
//
// ── WHAT A CONFIRM CAN BE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Three things, and they are told apart by the row under the cursor and by
// whether anything has been MARKED (alt+m):
//
//   - A FOLDER goes to the conversation, through the one seam every road onto a
//     directory comes out of ([app.referPlace]'s door): it is registered as a
//     scoped reference, it appears on the tray above the box, and the next
//     model request carries it. Its contents are never pasted anywhere.
//   - A FILE goes onto the MESSAGE, through the tray attach.go already owns: a
//     picture travels as content and everything else travels as a path the
//     `read` tool can open. Nothing about the conversation changes.
//   - SEVERAL OF EITHER, MIXED, in the order they were marked — which is the
//     order the pictures are then numbered in, because `[image #2]` means the
//     second picture and a tray built in another order would renumber somebody's
//     sentence under them.
//
// ── AND ALL OF ITS WORK RUNS OFF THE LOOP ───────────────────────────────────
//
// Registering a folder is a write on a local engine and a ROUND TRIP over a
// connection; attaching a file is a stat. Neither may happen under Update: a
// keystroke may not wait for a disk any more than it may wait for git
// (homeband_repo.go states that law, folderpick.go's header repeats it, and the
// synchronous version of this function was the last place in this surface still
// breaking it).
//
// So a confirm fires ONE command carrying everything it was asked to do, and
// the answer comes back as [folderTakenMsg]. Two things guard it:
//
//   - THE CONVERSATION IT WAS FOR. The message carries the session file that was
//     current when the person pressed enter. A `/new` in the gap means the
//     folders reached the conversation they were chosen in — the door was
//     captured in the command — and the SENTENCE about them is dropped rather
//     than printed into a conversation that never gained them.
//   - THE OPENING THAT ASKED. The picker's generation is carried for the same
//     reason every read on this surface carries it: what comes back has to be
//     told apart from what a second opening asked for.
//
// What this file CANNOT do is abort a call already inside a syscall or already
// on the wire — Go has no interruptible `Stat`, and `ReferPlace` takes no
// context. The bound that exists is real and is stated rather than dressed up:
// the batch is capped at [folderMarkCap] things, every step re-reads the app's
// own context before starting, and internal/remote's own call deadline bounds
// the wire. The terminal keeps drawing and keeps taking keys throughout.
