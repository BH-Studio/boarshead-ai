// THE PERMISSIONS PANEL: /permissions.
//
// The consent card (consent.go) is where a person says "always" about one call.
// It is a good place to say yes and a terrible place to remember having said it:
// the card scrolls away, and what it wrote lives in two settings rows a person
// has to go looking for. This panel is the other half of that sentence — WHAT
// HAVE I ALREADY ANSWERED, and let me take one back — which is a LIST, the shape
// this surface already knows how to draw:
//
//	  what runs without asking
//	  $ git status*
//	  ◇ read                                                          every call
//
// Four decisions, and three of them are borrowed rather than invented:
//
//   - IT IS THE OVERLAY GRAMMAR (palette.go), exactly as /connect and /harness
//     are: a short list under the draft, ↑↓, enter, esc. A second list with its
//     own manners would be a second thing to learn for a question of the same
//     shape.
//   - THE HEADING IS THE PANEL'S ONE SENTENCE and there is never a second one.
//     With nothing banked it draws the heading and NOTHING under it — not "no
//     exceptions", not "0 rules", not a paragraph explaining what could be here.
//     An empty list is already the whole answer, and a surface that narrates its
//     own emptiness is a surface that made a person read a sentence to learn
//     nothing.
//   - TWO GLYPHS AND A NAME. A '$' where the answer is about one shell command
//     and a hollow mark where it is about a whole tool, because those two are not
//     the same size of promise and the difference is the first thing a person
//     scanning this list needs. The dim tail carries the one fact the heading did
//     not already say — the breadth of a tool row, or the answer of a row that is
//     not an allow — and nothing at all when the heading said it.
//   - ENTER ASKS ONCE AND DROPS ON THE SECOND PRESS, which is what /connect's
//     disconnect does and for the same reason: what is on this list is what a
//     person deliberately banked, and one keystroke is not enough of a decision
//     to throw it away.
//
// THE HEADING IS A TITLE AND NOT A CLAIM ABOUT EVERY ROW. Nearly everything that
// lands here is an allow — the card never writes a deny (consent.go) — so the
// panel is named after what it nearly always contains, and the rare hand-written
// deny or prompt says so in its own tail rather than being filed under a word
// that is wrong for it.
//
// THE ROWS ARE THE PERSON'S OWN AND NOT THE POLICY IN FORCE, and that is the one
// surprising consequence worth stating here: inside a repository that answers
// tools.approval its row replaces the person's wholesale at launch
// (config/projectconfig.go, law 2), so dropping a line here changes what this
// person carries everywhere and changes nothing inside that repository. The
// panel offers what a person can take back, which is exactly what they put there.

// — the same ceiling every bottom-anchored list on this surface has.
