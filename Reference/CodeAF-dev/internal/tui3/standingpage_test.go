// key is pressed — rather than the shape of the code under it
// (standingpage.go).

// standingPlaceFake is a session that can be asked what stands over it. It embeds
// the scripted agent every other test here runs against, because the standing
// seam is a widening of that session and not a different one, and it MOVES ITS
// OWN ROWS the way the engine's resolver would: an order excepted from here
// stops standing here and starts being a "not here" line, and one stood down
// stops existing at all. A fake that answered the same three rows after every
// write would let a page that never re-read the engine pass.
