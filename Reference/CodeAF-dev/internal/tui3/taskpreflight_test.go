// THE ONE LINE THE CARD GAINS, AND THE ROW IT DOES NOT DRAW.
//
// The preflight's whole surface here is a dim row between the brief and the
// answers. Both halves of it are worth pinning: that the fact reaches the person
// while the countdown is still running, and that a proposal with nothing to say
// about other windows draws no row at all — an extra line on every proposal is
// how a warning becomes furniture and then becomes something somebody turns off.
