// ── A PAGE WITH NO COMPOSER ENDS WHERE ITS CONTENT ENDS ─────────────────────
//
// The task's record card and a job's page are the two surfaces here that draw a
// head, a body and a foot and have NOTHING under them: no composer, no place
// strip, no tab bar. Both padded the body out to the bottom of the terminal and
// pinned the rule and the key row there — so a six-line card in a fifty-row
// frame drew seventeen blank rows and put `esc back` on row thirty, and the
// reader's eye travelled the whole frame to find the foot of a page that had
// ended at line eleven (docs/design/polish/audit-tasks.md row 5).
//
// A PLACE IS THE OTHER CASE AND IS NOT COVERED HERE. The tasks LIST has a
// composer under it at a fixed row, which may not move (composerlayer.go), so
// the space between a short list and its rule there is honest emptiness and not
// a defect.
