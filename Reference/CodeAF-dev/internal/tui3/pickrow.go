// THE WALKABLE ANSWER ROW — one row of answers a person can WALK, and one line
// under it saying what the answer they are on will do.
//
//	[ 1 yes, set it up ]  [ 2 change when or where ]  [ 3 just once ]  [ 0 no ]
//	I'll keep doing this every Monday at 9am, everywhere, until you stop it
//
// ── WHY IT IS A MECHANISM AND NOT A CARD'S PRIVATE LAYOUT ──
//
// Every question this surface asks is the same shape underneath: a short row of
// answers, one of which the keyboard is on, each with a key that takes it
// outright, and the arithmetic of what fits and where each answer landed in
// screen columns lives here once rather than in each caller's own layout loop.
//
// ── IT IS DOWN TO ONE CALLER, AND THAT IS THE POINT ──
//
// It was written for the standing card and was meant to be spread. What happened
// instead is that every question on this surface moved onto ONE RENDERER
// (question.go, docs/design/questions/DESIGN.md), which draws its answers in the
// block's own spelling — `[1] allow once · [2] always` on a line, and one answer
// per row with its consequence beside it on a card. The standing card, the
// approval gate, the task proposal and both of the harness lane's questions have
// all been through that door; none of them draws a chip any more.
//
// What is left here is the INTAKE CARD raised for a saved program
// (subharness.go's [subCard]), which is a fullscreen page with a form on it
// rather than a question above the box — so the block is not on the frame for it
// to be drawn by, and the answers stay a walkable chip row at the foot of the
// page until that lane moves. THIS FILE GOES WITH IT. Nothing new may be built on
// it: a third spelling of one row of answers is exactly what the one-renderer
// wave exists to end.
//
// ── TWO WAYS IN, AND THE SLOW ONE IS NOT SECOND CLASS ──
//
// docs/DESIGN-LANGUAGE.md refuses keyboard speed bought at discoverability's
// expense: every chord keeps a visible, clickable, self-teaching door beside it.
// So the keys stay ON the chips for the hand that already knows them, AND the
// row is walked with ←/→ and taken with enter for the hand that does not — and
// the line under it reads out what the answer under the cursor will actually do,
// so walking the row is a way of READING the question rather than a way of
// guessing at it.
//
// ── THE PICKED ANSWER IS EMPHASIZED, NEVER OUTLINED ──
//
// THE EMPHASIS LAW: a thing is emphasized by raising its ground and turning its
// leading text accent, and nothing else ever changes. So the picked chip takes
// the ground ladder's selected step behind exactly its own cells and its KEY —
// the leading text inside it — turns accent. No new colour arrives, no ring is
// drawn round it, and the row does not reflow when the cursor moves, because
// every chip is drawn at exactly the same width picked or not.
//
// ── AND THE WAY OUT IS THE ONE CHIP THAT IS NEVER DROPPED ──
//
// A chip that does not fit is DROPPED rather than truncated — half an answer is
// an answer somebody presses by mistake — and that rule, left alone, drops from
// the RIGHT, which is exactly where a decline sits. A narrow window would then
// be the one place with no visible way to say no. So a caller may name one
// answer as the way out ([app.pickRow]'s `keep`), its room is taken off the top,
// and the answers before it compete for what is left.

// pickChoice is one answer on the row: the key that takes it outright, the word
// a person reads, and the SHORT spelling of that word for a row with no room for
// the long one.
//
// THE SHORT SPELLING IS NOT A TRUNCATION AND IT IS NOT OPTIONAL POLISH. A narrow
// window is where a person is most likely to be missing an answer they need, and
// the choice a row makes there is between saying every answer briefly and saying
// some of them fully — the consent gate settled that question first
// ([app.questionKeyRow]) and settled it the same way. A choice with no short
// spelling simply keeps its word at both lengths.
type pickChoice struct{ key, word, short string }

// spelling is this answer's word at one of the two lengths.

// ladder said sideways: two cells, everywhere on this surface a chip stands
// beside another one.

// pickChipText is one chip's cells, brackets and key included. It is the one
// place the bracket idiom is spelled, so the width the layout reserves and the
// string the painter draws can never be two different chips.
