// homeengine.go is HOW HOME TELLS AN ENGINE FROM A WINDOW.
//
// A row home draws as held is a journal under somebody's flock, and the kernel's
// answer stops there: it says a process has it and says nothing about which kind
// of process. Two live behind that one fact and they are opposites.
//
//	a window    another terminal has the conversation open in its own process.
//	            Nothing can join it; it can only be asked for (takeover.go).
//	the engine  this workspace's session host has it (internal/enginehost). It
//	            has no terminal, it survives every window that ever attached to
//	            it, and it hands the running conversation to whoever asks — which
//	            is what makes enter on such a row an ordinary open.
//
// SAYING `open in another window` ABOUT THE SECOND ONE WAS THE DEFECT. A person
// closed a terminal on four running tasks, came back, and home sent them looking
// for a window that had not existed for an hour — and the door under the row
// spent ten minutes asking it to let go before giving up.
//
// ── ASKED ON THE BEAT, ABOUT THE HELD ROWS, AND NOWHERE ELSE ────────────────
//
// The question is a connect to a unix socket. That is a keystroke's cost and not
// a label's — home draws twenty rows on every pointer movement, and [app.homeHeld]
// states the law — so it is asked the way the world itself is asked: on home's
// own three-second beat ([homeEvery]), OFF THE LOOP in a command, and only about
// the projects that actually have a held row on the screen. A home with nothing
// held asks nothing at all, which is almost every home.
//
// AND IT BUILDS NOTHING. [Options.EngineAnswers] answers under internal/enginehost's
// own law — ASKING WHETHER SOMEBODY IS THERE MUST NOT BUILD THEM A HOUSE — so a
// project that has never had an engine is left exactly as it was found.
