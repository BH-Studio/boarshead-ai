// BARGE-IN: ONE GESTURE FOR "STOP — I MEANT THIS INSTEAD".
//
// The thing being pinned here is a pair of meanings on one keyboard, and the
// dangerous half of the pair is the one that ALREADY WORKED. Plain enter over a
// running answer now steers, while cmd+enter parks the sentence (park.go); every test in the
// first block below exists to make sure the chord beside it never quietly
// became a second way to do that, or — very much worse — that enter never
// quietly became a way to stop a turn.
//
// Everything asserted is what a person would see or what the session was
// actually told: the agent's stop count, the words it received, the order the
// transcript ended up in, the line under the box.

// The draft is put in the box with [typeInto] (palette_test.go) rather than
// with [typeLine], which sends: the state this whole gesture is about is a
// sentence that has NOT been committed yet.

// bargeable is a streaming turn on a terminal that CAN spell the chord. The
// enhancement message is delivered rather than the field set, so the wiring
// from the terminal's answer to the feature's existence is under test too.
