// WHAT A TURN'S END OWES THE REPLY IT WAS WRITING (#225).
//
// The report was a surface unsure what the final answer is: a reply that sat
// raw until the next question, and a reply drawn as though it were thinking.
// The half of it that lives here is the FIRST — the turn boundary, and what may
// happen to a block after it has gone by. The other half is in
// internal/provider's answer_test.go, because deciding which streamed words are
// the answer needs the wire and this surface never sees it.
//
// Two laws, and they are separate:
//
//  1. NOTHING STREAMED OUTLIVES THE SETTLE. After a turn ends nothing is live,
//     and a delta arriving after it lands SETTLED on the answer it belongs to —
//     never as a new live block for the next question to close ([feed.settledTurn],
//     [app.growSettledAnswer]).
//  2. A LINE THIS SURFACE WROTE DOES NOT CUT THE REPLY IN TWO. A note landing
//     mid-answer used to close the live block, so the rest of the reply opened a
//     second one and the first half was demoted into narration — which is drawn
//     plain, so half a markdown answer came back as its source characters
//     ([feed.noteWritten] through [feed.said], hierarchy.go).
//
// The wants are asked of the STRUCTURE and of the RENDERED ROWS both, for
// settleboundary_test.go's reason: a test that sniffed the text for markdown
// would be agreeing with the defect rather than catching it.

// lateAnswer is the reply the report is about — a heading, a bold lead and a
// table, so a block that missed the markdown pipe says so three ways at once.
