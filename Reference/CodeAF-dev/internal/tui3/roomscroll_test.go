// ── A ROOM WITH HEAVY TOOL USE READS LIKE A PLACE, NOT A STUB ───────────────
//
// The screenshot these tests hold shut: a task whose turn had made a hundred
// and twenty calls drew four rows pinned to the top of the frame, a forty-row
// void under them, and a wheel that did nothing. Three causes compounded — the
// conversation's three-call fold applied to a page that IS the cluster, the
// folded calls absent from the row list so there was nothing to scroll to, and
// the slack falling under a page that had been starved rather than under one
// that was short. The fixes are render.go's [deck.toolTail], room.go's
// [app.roomToolTail] and [app.roomScroll]; this file is what they promise.
