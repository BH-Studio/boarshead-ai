// THE DELIBERATE GESTURE: a send that means "keep this true".
//
// Everything else about standing orders leans on the model NOTICING that an
// ordinary sentence was a standing one (internal/session's tools_standing.go).
// When that works it is the best thing on this surface, and when it fails it
// fails silently: the sentence is carried out once as ordinary work, the person
// watches something happen and believes a rule was made, and nothing is
// holding. There is no error, no card and nothing on the screen that reads any
// differently from a rule that WAS made.
//
// So there is a second road, and it is deterministic. A sentence handed over
// with `/standing <words>` reaches the model with an instruction saying so — it
// is shaped into a proposal or it is refused in one line, and it is never done
// as one-off work (internal/session's standing_mark.go). The card that comes
// back is the ordinary ratification card; nothing about the yes changes.
//
// THIS ROAD USED TO HAVE A CHORD TOO. `ctrl+enter` marked the draft from
// 2026-09-15 until 2026-09-30, when the queue took the chord over
// (followup.go): queueing is a gesture a person makes many times in a session
// and the mark is one they make a few times in a life, and the chord's other
// claimant — a terminal that cannot tell ctrl+enter from a plain enter — could
// not send the mark at all. The typed form above works on every terminal and
// every reach, and the box still teaches it: while the draft looks
// standing-shaped, the hint slot says the command ([app.standSayOffered]).

// The sentences this gesture says. The hint is quoted in
// internal/manual/chat/standing-orders.md exactly as it is spelled here.
var (
	// standSayHint is the hint slot's line while the draft looks standing-
	// shaped. It names the typed door, which works on every terminal — the
	// chord this slot used to teach is queueing's now (followup.go), and a hint
	// may only name a key that works (render.go's [app.hintWord]).
	standSayHint = "/standing keeps this true"
	// standMarkNowhere is the refusal where this build has no ambient side at

// standMarkShapes is the LOCAL, CHEAP look at a draft that decides whether the
// hint is worth drawing. It is a courtesy and never the doctrine: the real
// recognition is the model's, over the whole sentence, in `stand`'s own
// description — this list only has to catch enough of what people type to teach
// them the chord exists.
//
// SO FALSE NEGATIVES ARE FREE AND THE LIST STAYS SHORT. Every entry here is a
// phrase that is almost never anything but a condition; a wider list would put a
// dim line under half the drafts on this surface, and a hint a person learns to
// ignore is worse than one they never saw. It is matched at a word boundary for
// that reason too — "however" is not "ever", and "delivery" is not "every".
