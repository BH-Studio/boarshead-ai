// ── THE NUMBER A TAB WEARS, AND THE CLOCK THAT KEEPS IT TRUE ────────────────
//
// A TAB WEARS A COUNT ONLY WHEN SOMETHING IN IT CHANGED SINCE YOU LOOKED AT
// THAT PLACE (pages.go's [placeCounts] holds the law). Two things had to exist
// before that sentence could be true of anything: a look stamp PER PLACE, which
// internal/session's look.go now writes ([session.LastLookAt],
// [session.NoteLookAt]), and somewhere for the answers to be cached — because
// the tab bar is drawn on every frame of every place, and a bar that asked
// SQLite how many memories are new would ask it sixty times a second.
//
// So: the counts are computed on a clock, held in a map, and the map is what
// the bar reads. The map IS the seam — [placeTally] answers [placeCounts] — so
// the interface pages.go states goes on being the only thing the drawing knows
// about, and a test still hands the app its own tally.
//
// THE STAMP IS WRITTEN ON THE WAY OUT. A stamp taken on arrival would declare
// everything seen the instant it appeared, before a person's eye had crossed a
// row; leaving is the first moment "they looked" is actually true, and it is
// the same argument [session.NoteLook] makes about home's own stamp. A window
// that dies with a place open writes nothing, and the same things are news
// again next time — which is the harmless direction to fail in.

// placeTally is the cached count per place, and it is the whole of what the tab
// bar reads. Zero and missing are one answer: nothing in there has moved.
type placeTally map[string]int

// ChangedIn is [placeCounts]. It cannot block, which is the property the cache
// exists for: every answer here was computed on the clock below.
func (t placeTally) ChangedIn(place string) int { return t[place] }

// refreshPlaceCounts recomputes every tab's number. It is the ONE function that
// reads the records behind the counts, and it runs on a clock — home's while
// home is up, this file's while any other place is ([app.placeBeat]).
//
// A PLACE WITH NO STAMP YET COUNTS NOTHING. [session.LastLookAt] answers the
// zero time for a place nobody has left, and every reader below treats that as
// "no origin, therefore no news" rather than as "everything is news" — the
// first look must not greet somebody with a number over every tab.

// ── the clock the places that are not home run on ───────────────────────────

// reason — a memory learned in the next terminal, a model call charged by a
// task running behind this window — so this is that beat, armed when one of
// those places opens and re-armed only while one is standing.
//
// IT IS THE SAME PERIOD AS HOME'S AND IT IS HOME'S CONSTANT. Two clocks that
// drifted apart would be two answers to "how often does this surface look at
// the disk", and the number is already written down once.

// placeTickMsg is that clock's beat, carrying the generation of the place that
// armed it. The generation is home's own device ([homeTickMsg] tells the story):
// walking from memory to spend and back before an old tick landed would
// otherwise leave two self-re-arming chains reading the disk, then four.

	// recomputed as well — standing on the tasks place froze the memory tab's
