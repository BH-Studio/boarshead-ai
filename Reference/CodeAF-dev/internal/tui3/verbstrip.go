// ── THE VERB STRIP ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// NO KEY DOES ANYTHING THAT IS NOT DRAWN ON SCREEN RIGHT NOW (SCREEN 3a). That
// one clause is the whole design of this file, and it cuts both ways:
//
//   - a bare letter may not be a verb, because every printable key belongs to
//     the composer and always will — that is the product, not a compromise;
//   - and a page may not ADVERTISE a letter it has not bound, which home was
//     doing for three waves: `homeItemActions` says "p pause · s stop" on a
//     standing item's card and on home's own hint line, while home binds those
//     two actions to ctrl+e and ctrl+x and lets bare `p` and `s` fall through
//     and type. The strip fixes both directions at once — the letters become
//     real, and they become real only while the line naming them is on screen.
//
// So: `→` on a row that has verbs draws them, and while that strip is drawn the
// letters on it are the verbs and THE COMPOSER IS ASLEEP. `esc` or `←` closes
// it, and `enter` still opens the row. A wide home draws the options beneath
// the selected description; elsewhere the strip displaces the list by its own
// height. Either way the active letters are visible beside the selected item.
//
// The strip is [app.answerStrip] generalised. That function already held this
// law in its own words — "IT IS AN ANSWER, NOT A MIRROR: it draws only when the
// cursor's row carries a question the person can answer from here" — and all
// that changes is what opens it: a question being on the row, or a person
// pressing `→`.

// verb is one thing that can be done to the row under the cursor, in the row's
// own vocabulary. The letter is a MNEMONIC and never an index — `p` is pause
// wherever a row can be paused, on every place — because a person learns a verb
// once and meets it again.
type verb struct {
	key  rune
	word string
	do   func() tea.Cmd
}

// verbStrip is the strip's whole state: whether it is drawn, whose row it is
// about, and what is on it.
//
// The verbs are captured when the strip OPENS rather than asked for on every
// frame, so a letter cannot act on a row that has moved out from under it — the
// same reason home's hit maps are written by the draw.
//
// AND row IS WHAT MAKES THAT TRUE. Capturing the verbs is only half of it: a
// captured verb still fires if the cursor walks away and the strip stays up. The
// strip used to guard that with a list of the keys that move a cursor, and a
// list is a fourth place the same fact is written down — it went stale the day
// the tasks place bound `ctrl+n`, `ctrl+p`, `home` and `end` to its own cursor,
// none of which were on it, so `x stop it` could be captured on a running task
// and pressed on a finished one two rows down. The name of the row is not a
// list: it cannot fall behind a key nobody has bound yet, a wheel tick or a
// rebuild, because it is about the cursor's destination rather than about how
// the cursor got there ([app.holdStrip]).

// re-reading it — because none of them can reach a person without one of the
// two happening first. What a key was called never enters into it.
