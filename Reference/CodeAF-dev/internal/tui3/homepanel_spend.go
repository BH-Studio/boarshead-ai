// spendPanel is `spend`: a small HUD, THREE LINES THAT EACH SAY ONE THING. The
// heading names the panel; today's cost and allowance are already on the top
// line. Once the day has spent enough of its allowance to see, one thin meter
// says how much is gone. Then the fortnight, one block cell a day with today at the right, its
// total and its loudest day. Then who it went to and what for: the two models
// most of it bought, and how many chats and tasks today has seen. NO ROW OF IT
// IS A DOOR: the lines under the heading are a reading and not things to do
// anything to, so the cursor steps over them and a press on one does nothing
// (owner, 2026-09-17: "nothing under the spend title should be selectable or
// clickable"). The heading itself still opens the spend place, as every
// heading that names a place does ([app.homeHeadPress]).
//
// IT WAS TWO CHARTS (owner, 2026-09-10). A gauge-cell bar under the heading
// read as a second sparkline, the braille fortnight beside it was noise at a
// column's width, and the allowance said `$500.00` under a pulse saying `$500`.
// The meter is a line now and not a chart, the fortnight is block cells, and the
// allowance is spelled the pulse's way ([railFigure]).
