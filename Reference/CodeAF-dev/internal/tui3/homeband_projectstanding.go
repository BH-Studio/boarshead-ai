// THE PROJECT CARD'S SECOND BAND: WHAT IS KEEPING AN EYE ON THIS PROJECT.
//
// A project is not only its conversations. It is also the things a
// conversation left behind that go on working after the window is closed
// (docs/AMBIENT.md) — a reminder, a watch, a rule, an overnight job — and on a
// card about the whole project those belong beside the chats rather than under
// a screen of their own.
//
// THE ROWS ARE THE LEFT COLUMN'S OWN ROWS AGAIN. [standGlyph] and
// [standRollup] are what home's item row is made of (homestanding.go), so an
// item wearing `▲ your call` on the left cannot wear a cadence on the
// right. The glyph and the rollup are one claim made twice and it is made in
// one place.
//
// AND IT READS THE CACHE, NEVER THE STORE. A band is drawn on every frame the
// cursor rests on a row (homebands.go's laws), and the store is a directory of
// documents; [app.readStandBands] already walks it once per reading of the
// world and leaves the answer on [homeView.items], keyed by the project's
// bucket. Asking [app.standItems] here would be a second walk of the same
// directory on every keystroke, for the same answer.
//
// It folds at [homeItemsShown] — the same three the left column's own band
// folds at, and behind the same words — and it ends with one dim line saying
// what all of them have done in the last week:
//
//	4 runs this week · $0.06
