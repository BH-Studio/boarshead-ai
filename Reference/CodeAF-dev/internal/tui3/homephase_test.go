// WHICH LIFE ANOTHER WINDOW'S TASK IS IN.
//
// A node's state is `running` from its worker's first call to its landing, and
// for whole minutes in the middle of that the worker is not the one working: a
// check is reading what it left, or a repair round is closing what the check
// found. The live window learned to say so (taskphase.go); every OTHER window
// went on drawing a bare `running`, because the phase was on the node and the
// node is in another process.
//
// It rides the presence file now (session's [session.PresenceTask.Phase]), and
// these are the two halves of what that has to mean: a fresh row says the phase
// in the same words the live window draws, and a row nothing is behind any more
// says exactly what it said before this existed.
