// ── THE MANAGER: ONE CONVERSATION THE TEAM IS RUN FROM ─────────────────────
//
// A team may have one manager, recorded in the store as a member key
// ([teamstore.Team.Manager]). The person's words go to the manager, and the
// manager's to the members, through the Traffic log (teamtraffic.go). What is
// here is how the interface shows it and how a person makes one.
//
// THE MANAGER'S PLACE IS THE FIRST TAB. While a team narrows the strip, its
// first position is the manager: the manager's own tab, `◆ harbor`, named after
// the team rather than after its title, because it speaks for the team. Until
// the team has one, the place is a quiet `+ Manager`, a word button that costs
// nothing: no conversation exists behind it until it is pressed, and pressing it
// starts one, in the team's folder, as the manager ([app.teamManagerStart]).
//
// A MANAGER IS ALSO MADE FROM A MEMBER, and unmade. The strip's team switcher
// (teammenu.go) and a tile's Teams popover (wallpop.go) offer `Make manager` on a
// member of the team shown, and `Remove manager` on the manager, which leaves it
// an ordinary member.
//
// ON THE WALL the manager's tile is pinned first while its team is shown, and
// wears the same `◆` before its name.
//
// Everything a frame calls here reads memory only (framedisk_law_test.go); the
// writes are [app.teamEdit]'s.

// teamManagerGlyph is the manager's mark, and its ASCII spelling.
const (
	teamManagerGlyph      = "◆"
	teamManagerGlyphASCII = "*"
)

// teamManagerSlotWord is the manager's place while the team has none, and
// teamManagerWord what it says once there is one: `+ Manager` becomes
// `◆ Manager`, and the place never changes shape. It is named for what it is
// rather than for the team, because the chip beside it already names the team
// and `● harbor ▾  ◆ harbor` read as two harbors.

// Traffic is written where the session runs, and this window's profile is not
