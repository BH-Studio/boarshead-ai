// /crew — WHAT IS ALLOWED, AND WHAT IS PINNED. NOTHING ELSE STICKS.
//
// A task's crew is three seats — the WORKER that does the work, the PLANNER
// that structures it, the CHECKER that reads the result — and by default all
// three are AUTO: codeaf reads what kind of task it is and picks each seat for
// that task, at the point on the quality-for-money curve past which paying more
// stops buying much (internal/crewroute). The panel is where a person says what
// PERSISTS: which seat is pinned to which model, which models may be picked at
// all, and how much the crews may spend in a day. How hard to try ONE task is
// said in the ask — `/task --best`, `/task --cheap`, or `/redo stronger` after
// the fact — and moves nothing here.
//
// /model IS UNTOUCHED BY ALL OF IT. The model a person talks to is the
// conversation's; the crew is the models codeaf spends on its own behalf.
//
// THE BARE FORM IS THE PANEL (crewpanel.go): the five rows a person changes
// — three seats, the allowed models, the daily cap — edited where they stand.
// The four shortcuts write the same rows through the same writers and then
// open the panel with the tick on the row they changed, so a command and the
// panel cannot disagree about which crew is on:
//
//	/crew pin <seat> <model[@provider]>   /crew unpin <seat|all>
//	/crew models <all|open|≤in/out|list|+model|-model>
//	/crew cap <dollars|off>   /crew cap task <dollars>

// crewUsage is the one line every refused /crew form answers with.
