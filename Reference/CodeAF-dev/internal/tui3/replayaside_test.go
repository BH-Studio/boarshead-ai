// The line that wakes a turn — "task 7 could not be verified…" — is written by
// the SESSION and rides the user role, because that is the only role a model can
// be told something in. Live, this surface never draws it as the person's words:
// a woken turn writes no user line at all (followup.go's [app.startFollow]).
// Replayed, it did, because the journal had nothing but the role. session marks
// it now and hands it back as "aside" (its agent.go), and it lands in the lane
// this surface says everything of its own in.
