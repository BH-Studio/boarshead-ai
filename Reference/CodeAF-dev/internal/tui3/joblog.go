// ── A JOB'S PAGE IS ITS LOG, WHILE THE JOB IS STILL WRITING IT ──────────────
//
// A background job — a server, a build, a watch, a render — has no lane to
// subscribe to, no journal to replay, and no transcript it could ever grow one
// from. What it has is a FILE. The notice carries the path ([session.JobNotice.LogPath]),
// and everything the work has done is in there.
//
// THE LAW THIS FILE EXISTS FOR: the page reads that file under one discipline,
// the same one the far room's journal tail is read under and deliberately not a
// second one. A bounded reading, off the program loop, on [farRoomTick]'s beat —
// four times a second, because a file on a disk is a reading and not an
// animation. The last lines are drawn dim, in the order the process wrote them,
// newest at the bottom.
//
// THE NOTICE SAYS WHEN TO STOP, and one reading follows the stop: a process's
// last lines reach the file after the notice that watches it has settled, so a
// reader that quit on the landing would cut off exactly the ending somebody
// opened the page for.
//
// A HOSTED SESSION HAS NO PATH HERE, and that is a law rather than a limitation.
// The path on the notice belongs to the ENGINE'S machine; opening it on this
// disk finds either nothing or a stranger's file, which is precisely the fault
// the far card's own reader was written to avoid (taskcardhost_test.go pins it
// with a real file at the far path). The page says so rather than drawing a
// false empty log.
