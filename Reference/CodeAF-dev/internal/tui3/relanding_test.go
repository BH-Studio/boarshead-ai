// A LANDING THAT IS RE-SETTLED ASKS THE NEW QUESTION, NOT THE OLD ONE.
//
// A divided task landed `your call · nobody could check it`, the model spent
// `accept` on it under `task.settle = auto`, and the merge was refused by the
// person's own uncommitted copies of the files the task wrote. The node came
// back in the SAME state asking a DIFFERENT question with different answers —
// and the card in the conversation stayed frozen in the shape of the first
// landing while the room's foot said the work had finished (#767).

// THE CARD FOLLOWS THE NEW NOTICE. Its head is never rewritten — the span, the
// files and the branch are all still exactly as true as they were — but the row
// that says what is being ASKED is replaced, because that is the row that
// stopped being true.
