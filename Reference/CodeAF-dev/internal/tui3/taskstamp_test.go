// A TIME A PERSON READS IS THE WORK'S OWN, OR THERE IS NO TIME.
//
// An older task replayed out of a checkpoint can carry how long it RAN and
// nothing about when it started — a record from before the stamps existed keeps
// `elapsed_ms` alone. The page used to date one of those by when this WINDOW met
// it plus that duration, which for a terminal opened at 23:52 is a landing time
// after midnight: a stamp in the future. The tasks place then read that as
// tomorrow and dropped the row off the page altogether, so the one piece of work
// waiting on a person went missing while its shorter siblings sat above it
// saying `now`.
//
// These cases pin the three parts of the answer: recorded stamps are preferred,
// a node this window watched keeps its live clock, and an older node without
// either gets silence.
