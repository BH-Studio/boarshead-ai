// ── WHAT A CARD READS, AND WHEN ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ARCHITECTURE.md's fourth law: `open` and `tick` may read the disk and `body`
// may not. This file is the seam that makes it true of home's right column, and
// it takes the law one step further than that sentence does:
//
//	A KEY OR A POINTER ON HOME READS NOTHING AND RUNS NOTHING.
//
// Three bands were reading the disk while DRAWING, each behind a cache that made
// the cost look like nothing because it was paid once per card rather than once
// per frame. What that hides is that a card ARRIVES on every arrow key and on
// every hover that moves, so "once per card" is once per keystroke — on the
// update loop, in front of the next key. Measured on this machine, one `↓` onto
// a row home had not drawn yet cost:
//
//	the deliverables index   7-11ms   900KB of JSON, decoded to keep one row's worth
//	the conversation's tail  1-33ms   session.Peek scans the whole transcript
//	the repository            7.7ms   git status on codeaf's own worktree, 1s ceiling
//
// The first is gone: that index is one file about the whole machine, so it is
// read with the world and filed by conversation (homeband_deliverables.go). The
// other two are about the row itself and cannot be read in advance for every row
// on the machine — so they are ASKED FOR here and come back as messages, and the
// band draws the last answer it was given. A card with no answer yet draws no
// band, which is the emptiness law rather than a blank.
//
// AND NOTHING IS ASKED FOR TWICE. Each reading has a set of what is in flight,
// so a pointer swept down twenty rows asks about twenty rows once, not twenty
// times each.

// homeNewsMsg and homeLeftOffMsg are those two readings coming back. Each
// carries what it was ABOUT, because several may be in flight at once and an
// answer filed against whatever the cursor had reached would be another row's.

// refreshHomeCard asks for every reading the card that is about to be drawn
// needs — the row under the pointer, or under the cursor when no pointer is on
// the column ([homeView.previewLine]).
//
// IT ASKS FOR WHAT THIS CARD DRAWS AND NOT FOR EVERYTHING A CARD COULD DRAW. The
// resting list's card is the switcher's five bands (place_home.go's
// [app.homeSwitchCard]) and carries neither the inbox nor the journal's tail, so
// a person moving down that list pays for one `git status` per project and for
// nothing else at all.

	// reading that column needs is asked for here, on the key that moved the
	// cursor, rather than waiting for the next beat. It is the same peek, behind
	// the same cache: a conversation is read once for the life of the window and
	// a second ask costs a map lookup ([app.askHomeLeftOff]).
	//
	// EVERYTHING ELSE THE GRID DRAWS IS ABOUT THE ROWS RATHER THAN THE CURSOR and
	// is still asked for on the beat and at the open (homegrid.go's
	// [app.refreshGridReadings]). Reading every conversation on the screen up
