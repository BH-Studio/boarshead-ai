// THE FOLDER INDICATOR: what this conversation is about, where a person can see
// it, and the one gesture that takes it back off.
//
// Choosing a folder used to be a sentence in the transcript and nothing more.
// That is fine for the minute after you chose it and useless an hour later: the
// line has scrolled away, and the only way to find out which folders a
// conversation had gained was to open the picker and read its first rows. So a
// conversation that is about somewhere keeps a COMPACT CELL PER FOLDER on the
// tray above the box — the row this surface already keeps for "what the next
// message carries besides its words" (attach.go) — and a click takes one off.
//
// IT IS ONE CELL AND IT IS DIM. The folders are a fact about the conversation
// rather than a thing being said, and a permanent panel listing them would be
// the dashboard docs/DESIGN-LANGUAGE.md refuses. A conversation about nowhere
// draws nothing at all, which is nearly every conversation there is and is why
// the field test below is the first thing every reader of this file runs.
//
// THE ✕ IS DRAWN ONLY WHERE SOMETHING IS BEHIND IT. Taking a folder off needs
// `RemovePlace` on the far side ([placeRemover]); a build without it still shows
// what the conversation is about — that much is true and worth knowing — and
// simply does not offer the gesture, because a capability that cannot work is
// absent, not broken.
