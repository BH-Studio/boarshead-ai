// ── ONE ANSWER'S CASE, AND THE EVIDENCE IT BROUGHT ──────────────────────────
//
// A QUESTION IS A DECISION HANDED TO THE PERSON WITH ITS EVIDENCE ATTACHED
// (owner ruling 2026-09-09), and the evidence is per answer: what it means, what
// taking it leaves true, why the asker would take it, what would change its
// mind, how sure it is, and whatever it drew — a diagram, a diff, a table, a
// layout, a picture. The owner's picks of 2026-09-11 draw that evidence in three
// places:
//
//   - beside the list, in a pane that follows the pointer (preview A, a panel at
//     a hundred columns and wider, and page A, the page `o` opens);
//   - under the answer the pointer is on (preview-narrow B, the same panel
//     narrower than that, and the page on a narrow frame);
//   - folded to one line under the pointer, on a panel whose answers brought
//     nothing to look at (rec A: `already a dependency · fairly sure`).
//
// ALL THREE READ ONE ACCOUNT OF THE CASE ([questionCase]) AND DRAW BLOCKS
// THROUGH ONE RENDERER ([app.questionBlockRows]). The page used to spell the
// labelled lines itself and the panel spelled its one-line case itself, so the
// two disagreed about whether `would switch if` joined a model's `If you…` twice
// — which the page had fixed and the panel had not.

// questionCaseLine is one labelled line of an answer's case: the word that says
// which line it is, and what the asker said.
type questionCaseLine struct {
	label string
	text  string
	// pick is true for the lines only the asker's own pick carries. The one-line
	// fold under a panel's pointer says only those, because the answer's row is
	// already carrying what it leaves true beside its word.

}

// questionConfidenceLabel labels how sure the asker is, on the rows that say
// each line's word in front of it.
const questionConfidenceLabel = "confidence · "

// questionCase is one answer's case, in the order a person weighs it: what
// taking it leaves true, why the asker would take it, what would change its
// mind, and how sure it is.
//
// THE EMPTINESS LAW. A line with nothing the asker said is no line at all —
// never an empty one, never the word "unknown" — and the last three exist only
// on the answer the asker picked, because a reason is a reason FOR something.
