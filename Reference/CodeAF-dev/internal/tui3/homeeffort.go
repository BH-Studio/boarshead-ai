// ── `alt+e` ON HOME: ONE SCOPE, ON THE CARD THAT HAS A RUNG ────────────────
//
// Home draws one card at a time and the card is always about a row under the
// cursor. So the chord needs no state of its own to know what it means: it asks
// the screen the same question the screen asked to draw the card,
// [app.homeSubject], and moves the rung of whatever came back.
//
//	a standing item       that item's `does.effort` (internal/standing)
//
// EVERY OTHER SUBJECT IS LEFT ALONE AND SAYS NOTHING. A conversation's rung is
// that conversation's own sticky setting, kept in its session folder and moved
// from inside it; a project is not a thing that thinks. The card's legend does
// not name this key there, and pressing it does nothing at all — which is what
// the design language asks of a key with no door under it, rather than a message
// explaining why the screen declined.
//
// IT USED TO MOVE A SECOND RUNG. Home had a resting state — the cursor on no row
// at all, the column a card about the machine — and this chord moved the
// install's own default from it. That state is retired (`↑` off the top row
// reaches the tab bar now, pages.go's [barCursor]), so the install's rung is
// moved where it has always also been moved: the `thinking` row of the settings
// panel, which is the writer both roads went through anyway.

// AN ITEM'S OWN RUNG IS THE ONLY ONE THAT REACHES ITS FIRINGS, and this key is
// how it gets one. Nothing else on the machine reaches them — a standing run
// does not inherit the conversation's dial or the install's row
// (internal/session's standing_run.go), so an item nobody has dialled asks for
// nothing at all, and a check that repeats forever and answers to nobody is not
// turned into a deep pass by a rung somebody set months ago in a conversation.
// So the first press on a card is a deliberate gesture raising ONE item, and the
// card is where it is made because the card is where a person can see what the
// item is before they decide it deserves thinking about.
