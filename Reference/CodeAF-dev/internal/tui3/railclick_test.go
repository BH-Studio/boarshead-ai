// THE COLUMN OF WORK IS A COLUMN OF DOORS, AND THREE THINGS WERE EATING THE
// PRESSES.
//
// Reported as "the tasks on the right side — I am unable to open it, and it
// looks a bit not organized". Three separate defects in one gesture, all of them
// cells that answered a click and changed nothing a person could see:
//
//  1. THE SEAM CLAIMED TWO CELLS AT A WIDTH WHERE IT IS NOT A HANDLE. The resize
//     handle is the column's two leftmost cells at every width the column
//     stands at — but the third tier only exists from [railFloor] up
//     (task.go's [app.railColumns]), so between [railSlimFloor] and [railFloor]
//     the press was swallowed and nothing moved. Two dead columns of a
//     twenty-four-column list, down the edge a hand crossing from the
//     conversation reaches first.
//
//  2. THE STATE CELL FOLDED INSTEAD OF OPENING. The press asked whether the row
//     COULD disclose — a family root, or a landed row with a block tucked under
//     it — and the cell only DRAWS the ▾/▸ while the pointer is on that row. So
//     on every frame this surface was not holding a hover, the leading cell of a
//     root and of a finished row folded the list while the screen showed a
//     spinner or a tick. Opening any room drops the hover ([app.dropHover]) and
//     a pointer that has not moved sends no motion to put it back, so the click
//     straight after opening anything landed in exactly that gap.
//
//  3. THE COLUMN ANSWERED FOR ROWS IT DOES NOT DRAW. [app.railAt] had no
//     vertical bound outside the full-frame roster, so every press in the
//     frame's last thirty columns — the composer, the legend, the status line —
//     was taken by [app.railPress] and dropped.
//
// These hold all three ends, at every width tier and in every shape the column
// takes, and they press through [app.Update] rather than calling the hit-test:
// the ordering of the presses ahead of the roster's is part of what was being
// tested (app.go's mouse switch), and one of them goes the whole way through
// Bubble Tea's own SGR decoder.

// railFamily is the shape this column is actually met in: a root with four
// children, one of them with a child of its own, mixed running, queued, waiting

// and one flat node beside the family, which is the other row grammar.
