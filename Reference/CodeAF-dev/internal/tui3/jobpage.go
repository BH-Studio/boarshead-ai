// ── A JOB'S PAGE IS NOT A ROOM ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE LAW THIS FILE EXISTS FOR: a background job has no agent inside it and no
// transcript, so a page that wears a chat header and a composer is the wrong
// shape — every word of the refusal that used to sit in that composer
// (`this log grows as the job works — say it to main`) was true, and the layout
// should have been doing that work, not a sentence.
//
// SO THIS IS A CARD, not a room. The task record card is the host: a full-frame
// page over a list, a head and a foot of its own, and nothing typed into
// (taskrecord.go, placeTasks.ownFrame). A room is a chat pointed at a node. A
// job has nobody to talk to. Matching the card rather than inventing a third
// frame means esc, scroll and the foot's grammar are already a language a
// person knows, and there is no composer underneath to apologise for.
//
// The column's section (jobsection.go) is where a person presses enter;
// [app.showJobPage] records the id; [app.jobPageArm] starts the log's reading;
// this file draws whatever that id names.

// The words the page says. Each is quoted in the manual exactly as it is
// spelled here.
