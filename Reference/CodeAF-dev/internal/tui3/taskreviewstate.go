// reads `your call · nobody could check it · codeaf is deciding` instead. The

// to set for itself: the engine records who is holding a question
// ([session.TaskAskOwner], written by `task.settle = auto`, by the person
// handing one card over and by the floor that hands it back at the end of a
// turn), and a second answer kept here would go stale the moment any of those
// three moved it. An unanswered decision stays visible even inside a family.
