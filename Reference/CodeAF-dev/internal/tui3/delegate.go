// THE PROGRAMS CODEAF CARRIES, ON THE SURFACE: one command row per program the
// engine's build carries — `/senior-dev <brief>` — generated at launch from the
// list the conversation holds (internal/delegate/builtin, handed in by the
// launch). A program's row runs like `/task`: the words after it are the
// brief, the same door opens, a run starts, the turn goes on.
//
// THE ROWS ARE APPENDED TO THE LIVE TABLE AND NEVER TO THE LITERAL. The static
// table keeps its static gate (manual_test.go walks it); these rows exist only
// in a build that carries their program, and over `--host` only when the FAR
// machine's build does — which is right, because the program runs there.
