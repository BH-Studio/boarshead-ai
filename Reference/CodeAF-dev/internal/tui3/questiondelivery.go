// ── PRESENCE-AWARE DELIVERY, DECIDED IN ONE PLACE ───────────────────────────
//
// A question is raised by a lane that has no idea where the person is standing.
// This file is the only thing on this surface that answers that, and it answers
// it once for the block above the box, for home, for the desktop notification
// and for the bell — because a rule spelled four times is four definitions of
// "away" the first week one of them moves.
//
// ── THE ROWS THIS FILE CAUSES, EXACTLY AS THEY ARE DRAWN ────────────────────
//
// ON THE PAGE nothing here is drawn at all. The question goes to the block over
// the message box (question.go), which is where every question this surface can
// see is answered; this file only said that it may.
//
// ON ANOTHER PAGE of this same window — home, the tasks place, a room — the
// question stays counted by the chip and one dim row says where it went, on
// whichever line that place already has for saying things ([app.pageMsg], or
// home's own [homeView.say]):
//
//	allow rm -rf build? · waiting in this conversation · alt+y
//
// AWAY — ten minutes with nobody at this keyboard — and the project's rule
// could not take it: the same row on home, the desktop notification this
// surface already sends for a question nobody can see (notify.go), and, for a
// question something is BLOCKED on, one bell. Once, ever, per question:
//
//	allow rm -rf build? · waiting in this conversation · alt+y
//
// AWAY, and the project's rule took it: NOTHING ON SCREEN, which is not the
// same as nothing said. The answer goes through the one door and comes back as
// the receipt every answer leaves, with the dial named as who decided:
//
//	decided allow rm -rf build? → allow once · the rule · 14:02
//
// AND NOTHING IS HELD BACK. Several questions raised by one step used to be
// gathered here until "the model spoke again" and released as a sheet; the
// engine now names the step on every question it raises inside one
// ([session.Question.Batch]), so they go onto the block the moment they arrive
// and are drawn there as ONE panel (questionset.go). Holding them bought
// nothing but a delay — and once a deadlock: two `ask` calls waiting on
// answers to questions held for a boundary that could not come until they
// were answered.
//

//   - PRESENCE-AWARE DELIVERY. docs/design/questions/DESIGN.md: "On the page:
//     pinned now. On home or another page: in the row, plus the chip. Away
//     ([awayAfter], 10m without a key): dial resolves what it may and records
//     DecidedBy: dial; the rest go to home and the phone; the terminal bell
//     rings once for a blocking question only."
