// THE TERMINAL'S OWN TAB SAYS WHERE A PERSON IS INSIDE codeaf.
//
// A terminal title is read exactly when nobody is looking at the window — in a
// tab bar, the cmd-tab switcher, a tmux status line — so it answers the one
// question a glance from outside can use: which place in codeaf is this tab
// standing in, and is anything in it waiting on me. It is the place and the
// thing's own name, then the product, so a tab bar truncating from the right
// gives up the product first and the name last:
//
//	codeaf                              home, nothing waiting
//	3 want you · codeaf                 home, three things stopped on a person
//	porting the parser · codeaf         a conversation
//	new conversation · codeaf           one that has not been named yet
//	? porting the parser · codeaf       one waiting on the person
//	Fix the nil-map crash · task · codeaf   a task room
//	memory · codeaf                     any other place, by its own word
//	porting the parser @ devbox · codeaf    any of them over --host
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT IS A STATUS LINE. No spinner, no model, no cost,
// no clock: each would move the one piece of chrome a person cannot scroll away
// from, to say something that is not worth a glance from another workspace. So
// the title changes when a FACT changes — a place entered, a name arriving, a
// question coming up — and never on a timer.
//
// AND IT IS SENT TWICE OVER, ON PURPOSE, BECAUSE TERMINALS DISAGREE ABOUT WHICH
// TITLE A TAB WEARS. Bubble Tea declares the title as OSC 2, the window title,
// and that is what tmux, kitty, Ghostty and the window bar of every terminal
// read. Terminal.app and iTerm2 label a TAB with the icon name, OSC 1, and until
// this file wrote one nothing did — so the owner's Terminal.app tab read
// `<home>/…`, the running binary's path, beside a shell tab whose own
// program had set a real name. [app.retitle] writes OSC 1 and [app.View]
// declares OSC 2, and both are the same sentence ([app.titleSent]).

// titleMax bounds the sentence in cells. A tab shows twenty-odd characters and
// a window bar under a hundred; past sixty the bytes are pure cost down a
// channel that exists to say one line. It is the NAME that is cut to fit, never
// the suffix: ` · codeaf` is how a person tells a codeaf tab from a shell's.
const titleMax = 60

// The words the sentence adds to the names it borrows, quoted in
// internal/manual/chat/screen.md exactly as they are spelled here.

	// titleTaskWord follows a task's label, so a task room's tab cannot be read
	// as a conversation that happens to share its name.

// inside of it cannot come to disagree.
