// A CARRY-ON ANSWERED [session.NoChangeReply] LEAVES THE ANSWER BEFORE IT
// STANDING (#1065). The measured turn folded down to its last words, and its
// last words were the model arguing with the completion check — so the table
// the person asked for sat inside the chip, and only the argument stood.
//
// The events are the session's own order on that road: the answer and its
// boundary, the carry-on's notice, the token and its boundary. It drives the
// reducer directly, as the caption tests do, because what is pinned is what a
// confirmed response leaves in the transcript and what the fold then finds.
