// ── ORGANIZE: TEAMS SUGGESTED FOR THE CONVERSATIONS, NEVER APPLIED ALONE ────
//
// On the wall's All view the Teams row ends in ` ✦ Organize `. A press (or o)
// puts up a card of suggested teams, each ticked, and nothing changes until
// Apply; Undo, on the Teams row for a few seconds after, puts the list back
// exactly as it was.
//
// THE SUGGESTIONS COME FROM TWO PASSES. The folder pass is free and exact:
// conversations that share a project folder, two or more, are a team named
// after it, or additions to a team that already has its name. The model pass
// is one call on the naming role ([session.Agent.ProposeTeams]) for what a
// folder cannot see. The two are merged with the folder pass winning, and when
// the model is absent or fails the folder pass is shown alone and says so.
//
// IT ONLY EVER ADDS. A suggestion is a new team or conversations added to one
// that exists; nothing here removes a member or renames a team, so pressing it
// again is safe and nothing runs until a person presses it.
//
// The painter half is pure, as the rest of the wall's is: the card and the
