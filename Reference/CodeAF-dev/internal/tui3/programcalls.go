// page the surface already holds, with the frame's own clock for the call in
// flight.
//
// WHAT IS DRAWN IS THE PERSON'S, NEVER THE MACHINERY'S. A program's system
// prompt and the model's own words handed back to it are part of every call and
// say nothing new, so neither is ever a row; a program that summarized its own
// history is said in one line, not replayed.
