// ── WALKING INTO WORK THAT IS ALREADY UNDER WAY ─────────────────────────────
//
// The report these tests hold shut: "when I click on a task it seems like it is
// always starting from the start — streaming from the start — and moving between
// tasks, or from the chat to a task, the work is not displayed properly".
//
// A room has two lanes and they meet at ONE INSTANT: the journal is every
// message the node has COMPLETED, and the live lane is what happens FROM NOW.
// Everything the node is in the middle of falls between them — the answer it is
// streaming, the reasoning it is spilling, the tool that is running — and a page
// that draws neither of those is a page showing the last thing that finished,
// which is exactly "it is not displaying the work".
//
// The tests below drive the reproduction from both ends: what the FIRST FRAME
// shows on a node caught mid-flight, and what it shows again after walking out
// to the conversation and back, and after walking to another node and back.
