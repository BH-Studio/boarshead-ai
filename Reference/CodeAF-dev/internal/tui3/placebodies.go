// ── THE SHARED FOOT, AND THE HEAD THE POINTER COUNTS FROM ───────────────────
//
// What the frame draws for EVERY place and no place draws for itself: how tall
// the head is, the one line a place may say about what it is holding, and the
// prose a place with nothing in it teaches instead of a body.
//
// The frame itself is pages.go's ([placeFrame]) and a place's own rows are that
// place's file's — this is the part that is the same on all seven, and a router
// file that knew how one place draws is the shape ARCHITECTURE.md exists to
// retire.
//
// ── WHAT PROMOTION COST THE TWO OVERLAYS ────────────────────────────────────
//
// The standing list and the memory list were ≤12-row overlays drawn UNDER the
// draft, inside the conversation's chrome. As places they take the frame whole,
// which buys them the pulse, the tab bar, the composer and one key grammar — and
// costs them the two things being modal had bought:
//
//   - THEIR BARE LETTERS. `p` `s` `n` on standing and `u` `e` on memory were
//     bare because "no draft is under this list for a letter to fall through
//     into"; a place has a composer, so every letter belongs to it and the verbs
//     moved onto the `→` strip (verbstrip.go). Memory gains a real fix from
//     that: `u` was matched ahead of the filter, so the letter could not be
//     TYPED, and a search for a word containing a `u` lost it.
//   - `tab`. It cycled memory's scope; it is the way to the next place now, and
//     the scope moved to `alt+s`, which is the class a view belongs to.
//
// Both keep their bodies exactly as they drew them. What changed is the frame
// around them and the keyboard, which is the whole of what that wave claimed.

// placeHeadRows is how many rows every place spends before its body: the nav,
// the air row under it, the rule, and the blank under that (pages.go's
// [placeFrame]).
//
// THE STRIP IS NOT ONE OF THEM. It is a chat's own row, drawn only while a
// conversation is in front (head.go), so a place's body starts one row higher
// than a chat's and a click on that row is the page's.//
// IT IS A CONSTANT AND THE POINTER DEPENDS ON IT. A press arrives as a row of
// the terminal and has to become a row of the body, and the only honest way to
// subtract the head is to have exactly one number for how tall the head is.
// A head row added or removed is a change to this constant and to nothing else.
const placeHeadRows = 4

// chatHeadRows is the head while a conversation is in front: the places' four
// rows with the strip between the air row and the rule. A room inside a chat
// wears it too. A place does not.
const chatHeadRows = placeHeadRows + 1

// placeNote is the one line a place says about what it is holding, drawn under
// the rule and above the composer (pages.go's [placeFrame] states the law).
//
// It is where the counts, the filter lines and an open editor's label go — the
// facts that are about the WHOLE body rather than about the row under the
// cursor, and that would be a lie if they scrolled with it.

	// whose Option key is composing accents instead of sending meta, caught by the
	// character that arrived where a chord was aimed (chords.go). It goes in the
	// note slot because it is a fact about the whole frame rather than about the

// its own under the rule, so the rule stood one row higher on a place that had
// something to say than on one that did not — and the foot is the one edge of
// the frame a person's eye uses to find the box. On the rule, every place's
// foot is the same three rows at the same height (PLACES-AUDIT.md finding 1).
//
// The lines arrive painted and led by the one cell every note row carried, so
// the lead is trimmed and the lines are joined with the surface's middle dot.
