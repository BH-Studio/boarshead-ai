// ── ONE LADDER, WHEREVER A PERSON CAN MOVE IT ───────────────────────────────
//
// The picker's ctrl+t used to walk a list of its own — off, low, medium, high —
// while the ladder had five rungs and the `thinking` settings row offered all
// five. Two vocabularies for one dial cost two things, and both are pinned here:
// a level this walk did not recognise was CLEARED rather than climbed, so
// `codeaf --reasoning xhigh` lost its pin to one keypress; and `xhigh` and `max`
// could not be reached from the picker at all.

// A PIN IS NEVER THROWN AWAY BY ONE KEYPRESS. This is the surface's half of the
// law #643 settled on the wire: a level somebody asked for reaches the request,
// or the person is told what displaced it. Silently dropping it is neither.
