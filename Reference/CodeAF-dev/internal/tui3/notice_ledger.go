// THE LEDGER: what this profile has already been told.
//
// One small JSON file beside config.json — `notices.json` — holding, per notice
// id, how many sessions it has been shown in and when it retired, and the build
// the news channel last saw. It is the whole of the notices' memory across
// restarts, and it is written the way the profile's other files are written
// (internal/config's budget.go): whole, to a temporary name in the same
// directory, then renamed over the old one, so a crash mid-write leaves the
// previous ledger and never half of a new one.
//
// A MISSING OR UNREADABLE LEDGER IS AN EMPTY ONE. The worst thing an empty
// ledger does is show a tip a person has seen before, and no version of that
// is worth a line in the transcript about a file they did not know existed.

// noticeLedgerName is the file, beside config.json in the profile directory.

// noticeLedgerPath is where the ledger lives, resolved the way config.json
// beside it is resolved ([config.ProfilePath]).
//
// AN EMPTY PROFILE DIRECTORY IS THE NORMAL CASE, NOT THE ABSENT CASE, AND
// ABSENCE IS A HOSTED WINDOW. This function used to answer "" for an empty
// directory and the board then held its memory in RAM for the session — which,
// because CODEAF_PROFILE_DIR is set on almost no launch, is what happened on
// almost every launch: a hint that is meant to age out after three sessions was
// on its first session every time, a hint retired by the gesture it teaches came
// back at the next start, and the news channel never had an older build to
// compare against, so a shipped feature could not announce itself. The ledger is
// four small keys beside the settings they are about, and it belongs wherever
// those settings are.
//
// A CONNECTION CHANGES NOTHING HERE, which is what makes this different from the
// crew (crew.go). What the ledger remembers is which KEYS the person at this
// keyboard has already been taught, and the keyboard is this machine's however
// far away the engine is — so a hosted window keeps its hints in this laptop's
// own state root, like every other thing this surface remembers about its own
// chrome.
