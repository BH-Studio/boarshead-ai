// THE DRAFT IS THE PERSON'S, NOT THE SESSION'S.
//
// That one sentence decides everything in this file. The half-written message
// in the box belongs to whoever typed it, so it survives a closed window, a
// crash, a /new, and a session file that has moved on without it — a draft
// older than the session's last message is STILL restored, because the person
// who typed it did not stop meaning it when a turn finished. It is keyed by
// directory rather than by session for the same reason: the sentence was about
// this project.
//
// It is cleared on submit, and only on submit.
//
// ── AND IT BELONGS TO ONE BOX ──
//
// A draft is the text in a window's input, and two windows open on one project
// are two inputs. Keyed by directory alone they were one file: each window's
// debounce overwrote the other's half-sentence, whichever quit last decided what
// survived, a submit in either deleted what the other was still typing, and both
// restored the leftover at startup — the person's own words appearing in a
// window they had never typed them into. So the name carries the WINDOW as well
// as the directory, and the window is this process.
//
// What that costs is the restore, and paying it is [adoptDraft] below: a
// window's own file is gone the next time codeaf starts, because the pid is. A
// draft whose window is dead is an ORPHAN, and an orphan is the person's
// sentence with nobody holding it — so the next window opened on that directory
// takes it over. A file whose pid is still running is never touched, which is
// the one guarantee that matters here: it is better to leave a sentence on disk
// for the next window than to lift it out of a live one.

// draftOwner is what this process's drafts are named after. A pid is unique
// among the processes alive at one moment, which is exactly the property the
// name needs — two windows open at once cannot share it — and its reuse after a
// window dies is harmless, because a name that comes back around is a name whose
// original holder is gone and whose file was an orphan anyway.
var draftOwner = os.Getpid()

// draftDebounce is how long the box has to be still before the draft is
// written. A file write per keystroke would be a syscall per character to save
// a sentence nobody has finished; three hundred milliseconds is the pause
// between words.
const draftDebounce = 300 * time.Millisecond

// draftSaveMsg is the debounce firing, carrying THE FILE IT WAS ARMED FOR.
//
// THE NAME IS ON THE MESSAGE BECAUSE THE SURFACE CAN HAVE MOVED. A person who
// types half a sentence and switches to another project inside the three
// hundred milliseconds of the debounce would otherwise have this tick land on a
// surface whose box holds the OTHER conversation's words and whose draftFile
// names the other conversation's file — one sentence written under a name that
// does not belong to it, and the real one lost. The conversation being left
// writes its own box on the way out (switcher.go), so a tick that no longer
// matches has nothing left to do.

// draftOrdinals is how many drafts this process has named on each workspace,
// keyed by the canonical directory.
//
// IT EXISTS BECAUSE ONE TERMINAL CAN HOLD TWO CONVERSATIONS IN ONE PROJECT.
// The name used to be the workspace and the pid, which is unique among the
// processes alive at one moment and was therefore enough while a process held
// one conversation per directory. /new twice in one repository now makes two,

//
// IT IS NOT A PURE FUNCTION AND MUST NOT BE CALLED TWICE FOR ONE CONVERSATION:
// each call takes the next ordinal for that workspace, which is what stops two
// conversations of this process colliding. The door calls it exactly once, in
// the same breath as it builds the agent (cmd/codeaf's chatv3_process.go).
