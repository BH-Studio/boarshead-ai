// Markdown on this surface is internal/tui2/prose, unchanged.
//
// A model answers in markdown whether or not anyone asked it to, and there is
// exactly one renderer in this tree that turns that into rows without handing a
// second colour authority a seat on the screen — goldmark's parser walked into
// internal/tui2/tokens. Adapting it here is four lines and one cached Styler;
// re-deriving it would be a second heading ladder, a second table fitter and a
// second answer to what a 16-colour terminal may draw, all drifting from the
// first the week after they were written.
//
// What this file owns is therefore only the two things prose leaves to a
// caller: which Styler paints, and which measure the prose wraps to.
//
// "Which Styler paints" is doing more work than it looks like. The Styler is the
// colour authority, so stating the BODY INK on it ([newMarkdownStyler]) is not a
// second authority arriving — it is this surface answering the one question the
// authority cannot answer for it, which white a reply's paragraphs are read in.
// Everything else about the row — the heading ladder, the code ramp, the raised
// plane under an inline span, what a 16-colour terminal may draw — stays prose's
// and tokens'.
//
// CODE FENCES STAY ON THE TOKENS RAMP, and this is the whole of D11's "else"
// branch. Decision 11 asks for a pastel chroma style (catppuccin-mocha) on
// fenced code IF it can be had without editing internal/tui2 — and it cannot:
// prose.Options carries a width, a measure, a Styler and one semantic callback,
// with no theme parameter and no seam for one. Behind it, prose/code.go BUILDS
// its chroma style out of the tokens ramp and maps every chroma token onto a
// tokens.CodeSlot, so there is no style to swap from this side even in principle
// — the theme is the token layer. Adopting mocha here would mean adding a whole
// second ramp to prose, and would hand the surface a second colour authority —
// exactly what prose's own package comment rejects glamour for.
//
// The cost is small and the floor is already right: the tokens ramp is muted by
// construction, so a fence renders quiet next to styles.go's pastels rather
// than clashing with them. If the theme is wanted later it is one option on
// prose.Options and one line here, and it belongs to whoever owns tui2.
//
// THE BODY INK IS NOT A COUNTER-EXAMPLE to any of that. Stating one token's
// value on the Styler is naming a colour to the authority that already owns the
// answer; shipping a rival ramp is standing a second authority beside it. The
// first is one value and one law to hold it (styles.go, THE GLARE LAW); the
// second is two hundred token relationships maintained twice.

//
// The profile comes from [tokens.DetectProfile], the same door cmd/codeaf opens

//
// ── AND THE BODY WEARS THIS SURFACE'S OWN INK ──
//
// THERE IS ONE BODY WHITE ON THIS SCREEN AND IT IS THE PALETTE'S. Left alone,

// [hueInk] — two whites on one screen, and the louder of them on the thing a
// person reads most, at a contrast the palette spent a whole wave coming down
// from (styles.go, THE GLARE LAW). So the Styler is handed the ink before it is
// handed to prose, and the reply's paragraphs, headings and inline code spans
// all come back in it.
//
// The ladder it comes from is asked the way [detectPalette] asks: [rampFor] with
// [themeAuto] and the same environment. It has to be the same question — a
// person on a white terminal reading a reply in a dark-terminal white would be
// the two-whites defect wearing its other face — and asking it here rather than
// caching a ramp keeps ONE answer to "which ladder is this terminal on".
//
// Nothing below the 256 rung takes the override at all, and that is
// [tokens.Styler.WithBodyInk]'s decision rather than one made here: the sixteen
// are the user's own theme, and an authored hex has no honest form there.

// ── THE PHONE TIER ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A fenced block TRUNCATES (prose/code.go says so, and says why: indentation is
// how source is read, and a caller that can scroll should do the cropping). At
// forty-four columns there is no caller that can scroll sideways, so the law is
// right everywhere except here, where its premise is false — the reader has no
// horizontal scroll and the cut takes the half of the line that carried the
// meaning. Same for a table: a four-column table fitted into forty-four cells
// is four ellipses.
//
// So the phone tier, and ONLY the phone tier ([layoutTier] — this file never
// compares a width itself), wraps instead of cutting. Everything above it
// reaches [proseRows] and renders byte-identically to before.
//
// THE WIDTH THIS SEES IS THE BODY'S, NOT THE FRAME'S, and the two agree where it
// matters: the rail is the only thing that takes columns off the frame, and it
// takes none under railSlimFloor (task.go, 100) — so a body under 60 cells can
// only have come from a frame under 60 cells. Reading the tier off the width the
// text is actually laid out in is also the honest question here: what wraps is
// this column, not the window around it.
//
// THE EDIT IS AT THIS CALL SITE AND NOWHERE ELSE. internal/tui2/prose is a
// second surface's renderer with its own suite; a wrap mode added there would be
// this slice legislating for tui2. What this file does instead is hand prose a
// document whose code lines already fit — the wrap is ours, the rendering,
// tinting and ground stay prose's — and mark the rows it split.

	// stands in that column: it is dim, it sits in a margin whose next cell is

// is read, and a caller that can scroll should do the cropping — and the second
// half of that sentence is the premise. THERE IS NO HORIZONTAL SCROLL ANYWHERE
// ON THIS SURFACE, at 160 columns any more than at 44: no key pans a block, no
// door opens one wider, and copy mode yanks the rows as drawn. So a cut line was
// a line that could not be read, could not be copied and could not be trusted —
// and the cut moved with the frame, so the same answer was whole in one window
// and truncated in the next, which is the difference that sends somebody hunting
// a bug in their own code that is not there.
//
// It was worse than the audit had it. At 80 columns the tail simply stopped —
// `…if room >= 0 { ` and then ground — with no ellipsis anywhere on the row, so
// nothing at all said that bytes were missing.
//
// WHY WRAP RATHER THAN A DOOR. A door (`▸ 3 long lines · ctrl+e`) is the shape
// this surface uses for something a person may not want to see; a line of code
// in an answer they are reading is not that — it is the thing they came for, and
// putting it one keystroke away spends a key to hide what was already on the
// screen. The wrap costs a row and nothing else, it needs no state, it survives
// a resize by re-wrapping, and the marker in the margin says which rows were
// split so the reader can tell a wrap from a newline. The machinery is the one
// the phone tier has been using and has tests for; all this does is stop asking
// the frame's width whether the reader deserves it.
//
// A TABLE IS NOT THE SAME QUESTION. Stacking a four-column table into records is

// ── INLINE TASK LINKS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A MODEL THAT SAYS "task 7" IS NAMING A DOOR, AND THE DOOR WAS NOT THERE.
// Everywhere else on this surface a running node can be pressed — the strip's
// chips, the roster's rows, a spawn card, a landed card — and the one place the
// work is named most often is the reply that talks about it, where the name was
// nine dead cells of prose. A person reading "I split this into task 7 and task
// 8" had to go and find those two rows in a column to look at either.
//
// So a reference becomes a link: accent, underlined, and pressing it opens that
// node's room through the same door the chips use (room.go's [app.openRoomFor]).
//
// ── THE GRAMMAR IS SMALL ON PURPOSE ──
//
// A number in prose is almost never a task, so the only shapes recognized are
// the ones that name one out loud — an anchoring "task"/"tasks", a space, an
// optional "id", an optional "#", and the digits:
//
//	task 7 · task #7 · tasks id 7 · task id #7
//
// A bare "7" is not one, a bare "#7" is not one, "taskbar 7" is not one, and
// "task 7.1" is not one (a version, a date and a range all read that way). What
// this refuses costs a reader nothing — the words are still there — and what a
// looser grammar would cost is a paragraph pockmarked with underlined numbers.
//
// AN UNKNOWN ID IS PLAIN TEXT. The reference is resolved against the nodes this
// surface has actually seen ([app.tasks]) and a miss is left exactly as the
// model wrote it. A link that opens nothing is worse than no link: it is the
// surface claiming a door it does not have.
//
// ── IT IS A PASS OVER RENDERED ROWS ──
//
// The pass runs on the ROWS prose already produced, not on the markdown behind
// them, and that is what keeps it correct at every width: the wrap has already
// happened, so a reference split across two rows is simply not one, and the
// phone tier's re-wrapped fences and stacked tables need no special case. It is
// a pure function of (row, task index) — no state, nothing cached — so a resize
// re-derives it and a re-render produces the same bytes.
//
// CODE IS NOT PROSE AND GETS NO LINKS. Two guards cover the code that can name
// a task: a fenced block carries [tokens.GlyphCodeGutter], while a non-path
// inline span carries prose's raised plane. Path spans deliberately drop that
// plane under ONE VISIBLE MARK PER TOKEN, but the linker's path grammar cannot
// recognize their whitespace-bearing task reference anyway. At profiles with
// no plane, prose restores backticks and [masked] reads those instead.
