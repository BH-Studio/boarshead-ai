// REWIND MODE: the conversation, with a line drawn across it.
//
//	  › and now write the tests                         (the anchor, brightened)
//	─ ⟲ rewind here ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//	  ⠿ everything under the line, washed out — this is what the cut drops
//
//	 ⟲ drops 2 turns          ↑↓ turns · ←→ steps · enter rewind · esc back
//
// THIS IS THE QUICK TIER OF TWO, and the transcript is its picker. The thing a
// person taking something back is deciding about is on the screen already, in
// the shapes they read it in the first time, and the whole of this mode is a line
// through it plus a bar where the box was. Nothing is drawn twice, and nothing
// covers the very rows the decision is about.
//
// THE DELIBERATE TIER IS THE TIMELINE (rewindsheet.go): the whole conversation as
// a full-frame list with a search, a preview and a two-stage enter, which /rewind
// opens and which `tab` in here lifts into with this cut carried over. It exists
// because this mode walks the DRAWN blocks and the drawn blocks are a windowed
// tail (replay.go's [replayTail]), so a resumed conversation's early turns cannot
// be reached from here at all. The two share the ⟲ glyph, the "drops N turns"
// arithmetic ([rewindDropCount]) and the cut itself ([app.rewindLand]).
//
// THE MODE BAR TAKES THE DRAFT'S OWN POSITION, and the draft is stashed for the
// duration. That is the recall walk's bargain (recall.go) applied to a bigger
// state: a mode that overwrote a half-written sentence would be a mode nobody
// could enter without first saving their own work somewhere else, and esc puts
// the sentence back exactly as it was.
//
// THE DOOR IS DOUBLE-ESC, and it is double for one reason: esc already means
// INTERRUPT while a turn runs, and that meaning is not for sale. So the first esc
// keeps whatever it always meant — it stops the model mid-turn, and at rest it
// does nothing at all — and it ARMS this mode for [rewindArmWindow]; a second esc
// inside that window opens it. Interrupt first, then rewind, in the order the
// engine's own refusal asks for ([session.ErrTurnInFlight]): the pair is one
// gesture, and it is the gesture a person's hand already makes when they want to
// take something back.
//
// KEYS: ↑/↓ walk the TURNS, which is the unit a person thinks in ("not that
// message"); ←/→ slide through the steps inside the turn the cut is in, for the
// rarer "not that part of it". enter commits, esc leaves with nothing changed.
// The pointer can do all of it too — a click chooses the nearest cut at or above
// the row, the cut line itself commits — but NOTHING here is pointer-only,
// because the mouse is opt-in on this surface (view.go's [app.View]).
//
// WHAT A COMMIT DOES: it calls the engine, and then it throws the drawn blocks
// away and builds them again from the transcript the engine now holds
// ([app.rebuildTranscript]). It does NOT prune the block list by hand. The blocks
// on screen and the messages in the session are two renderings of one
// conversation, and the only way to keep them from drifting after an edit is for
// one of them to be derived from the other — which is exactly what the resume
// path already does.

// rewindArmWindow is how long the first esc keeps rewind armed.
//
// HALF A SECOND, and the number is chosen against the HAND rather than against a
// reaction time. A deliberate double-tap — the double-click every pointer on this
// machine is calibrated for, and the "esc esc" that leaves an editor's mode —
// lands its second key inside 300ms; a person who pressed esc to interrupt a turn
// and then decided, having read something, to also take it back is a person
// making a second decision, and their second key arrives a second or more later.
// So the window has to be long enough that the first kind never misses and short
// enough that the second kind never fires by accident.
//
// It errs SHORT on purpose. A window that lapsed too early costs one extra
// keystroke; a window that lapsed too late puts a person who tapped esc twice to
// dismiss two things into a mode they did not ask for, over a conversation they
// are about to cut. The two mistakes are not the same size.
