// THE PULSE'S ONE READING, DRAWN AND WITHDRAWN (issue #837).
//
// A node's beat sidecar is the only witness that knows a model call went out
// and has not come back: the page's own rows cannot say it, because a request
// still streaming has written no entry yet. These tests feed the open page a
// beat row each way round and read the header the same draw reads it — the
// live segment is the chat foot's own sentence, and the call's clock stands in
// the task's own clock's place only while the call is open.

// beatRoom is a running node's page with the pulse held the way a reading
// leaves it: the row on the beat side, and the reading flag that says it was
// read rather than merely empty.
//
// THE CALL'S AGE IS GIVEN AND THE INSTANTS ARE DERIVED FROM THE APP'S OWN
// CLOCK, never from [time.Now]. This surface is driven by a fixture clock that
// does not sit near the wall clock, so a row built from the real one puts the
// request's start in the app's future, the elapsed comes out negative, and
// [countUpWord] answers "" — which reads on a failure exactly like the header
// refusing to draw. The first draft of this file did that and reported the
// feature broken while it worked.
