// THE DEFECT: "option left right and cmd and clicking does not seem to work".
//
// The terminal was never the problem. iTerm2's Natural Text Editing mappings —
// which the reporter's only profile carries — send `esc b` for Option+←, `esc f` for
// Option+→, the byte 0x01 for ⌘← and 0x05 for ⌘→, and the decoder hands those to this
// surface as `alt+b`, `alt+f`, `ctrl+a` and `ctrl+e`. The message box has bound
// all four for as long as it has existed. What had none of them was every OTHER
// box on the program — home's, the errand pane's, the settings and task and
// rewind filters, and the twelve overlays behind [listNavigate] — so the jumps
// worked in the conversation and were dead everywhere a person met the surface
// first. `ctrl+e` was worse than dead on home: it archived the row under the
// cursor, so a hand reaching for the end of a sentence put a conversation away.
//
// The tests below feed the chords in the SHAPE THE TERMINAL DELIVERS THEM —
// a Key with a code and a modifier and no text — rather than the byte strings,
// because that is what every one of these routers actually reads.

// macKey is one of the four chords a Mac keyboard sends for the word and line
// jumps, spelled the way the decoder spells it: `option+←` reaches this program
// as `alt+b` with the modifier set and NO text, and `cmd+←` as `ctrl+a`.
