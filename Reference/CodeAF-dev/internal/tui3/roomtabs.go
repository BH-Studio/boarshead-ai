// work said and did, and the work, which is what it changed.
//
// EVERY TASK'S PAGE HAS BOTH, on either engine, because there is one page type
// (planroom.go). They are named at the right end of the trail row, beside the
// way out, where they cost no row of the page: `tab` over an empty box moves
// between them, and a press on either name opens it.
