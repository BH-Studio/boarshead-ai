// THE AMBIENT BAND ON HOME: WHAT IS KEEPING AN EYE ON THINGS, UNDER THE PROJECT
// IT BELONGS TO.
//
// docs/AMBIENT.md Part 5 first proposed that home list a CONVERSATION by what
// it came to — a session that produced a reminder would be drawn as that
// reminder. That is superseded here, and the reason is a person's own reading
// of the screen: a conversation and the thing it left behind are two objects
// with two lives. The conversation goes quiet and folds away like every other;
// the item goes on firing for a year. Filing one under the other means home
// either hides a live item behind a fold about a dead chat, or keeps a chat
// alive on the list because something it made is still running.
//
// SO AN ITEM IS ITS OWN ROW, under its own project, in one band. It is the
// smallest thing that can be true of it: a glyph, the person's words, and one
// rollup saying where it stands. Opening it opens the conversation that asked
// for it, which is the provenance rule Part 5 got right — "why did I get this?"
// must always have an answer, and the answer is always a door.
//
// TRIAGE IS ONE ORDER ACROSS BOTH KINDS. Home's whole job is what wants you
// first, and a screen that sorted sessions by urgency and then stapled a band
// of items underneath would put an item that needs somebody below four
// conversations that do not. So an item that needs you, or is firing right now,
// sits WITH the conversations that do — above them, because a conversation is
// the bigger object and a person reads down into the small ones — and everything
// still waiting for its time sits under them, above the quiet fold. That is the
// same shape [session.sortSessions] already gives one project's conversations,
// applied to the two kinds together.
//
// AND THE BAND IS BOUNDED. Three rows, then one door saying how many more there
// are. Density on this screen is omission and never compression (home.go's
// header), and a project with eleven watches on it is a project whose watches
// are not the news.

// homeItemsShown is how many items a project draws before the rest collapse.
// Three and not [homeShown]'s four: the item band sits under a list of
// conversations that already spent four rows, and a section that takes as much
// room as the thing it is a footnote to has stopped being a footnote.
//
// IT IS A FLOOR AND NOT A CEILING, exactly as [homeShown] is. An item that needs
// somebody or is firing right now is drawn whatever the count says — those are
// the rows this screen exists for — and the collapse takes only the ones still
// waiting for their time.
