// THE STANDING SIDE, IN THE CONVERSATION: ONE CARD, AND ONE LINE AFTERWARDS.
//
// A STANDING ITEM IS A TASK WITH A WHEN (internal/session's standing_contract.go
// says so first). That sentence is the whole of this file's shape: the block
// below is [app.taskCardRows]'s block — the same corner, the same question hue,
// the same stem, the same walkable answer row, the same draining meter — with
// TWO MORE BANDS between the words and the answers:
//
//	when   the model's own phrasing of the cadence, and never the spec. A cron
//	       line read back to a person is a spec nobody can check.
//	costs  what one firing may spend and how often it may fire, plus — on the
//	       three kinds that are actually LOOKED at on a clock — how often the
//	       looking happens.
//
// AND IT DECLINES ON THE CLOCK, WHICH IS THE ONE PLACE IT PARTS FROM THE TASK
// CARD. A task proposal approves on silence because its work is bounded and
// watched; a standing item spends forever with nobody in the room, so an
// unanswered card ends as nothing (standing_contract.go states the law). The
// meter therefore says `ends in` rather than `auto-starts in`, and the settled
// row says nothing was set up. THE ENGINE OWNS THAT CLOCK: this surface stops
// asking when the deadline passes and never answers for it, exactly as
// [app.tickTasks] does for the other card.
//
// AFTERWARDS THERE IS ONE LINE AND NEVER TWO. Everything a standing item does
// once it stands — it was set up, it said something, it needs somebody, it
// stopped — arrives as EventStandingUpdate and draws exactly one dim row in the
// transcript ([standUpdateRow]). QUIET IS THE DESIGN: a routine that checked and
// found nothing writes nothing here at all, and the surface must never be the
// place that turns a quiet mechanism into a chatty one.

// standingAgent is the slice of the engine this file needs, and it is asserted
// rather than added to [Agent] — the standing contract is OPTIONAL, exactly as
// the task contract is ([taskAgent] says why at more length). A scripted agent
// that has never heard of a standing item is a session with the ambient side
// off, and it must stay representable.
type standingAgent interface {
