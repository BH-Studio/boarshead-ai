// ── THE BOX SEAM — ONE RULE ABOVE EVERY BOX A PERSON TYPES TO AN AGENT IN ────
//
// Every box on this surface that sends words to a model has the same line
// over it, in the same shape, with the same three cells and the same three
// doors on them:
//
//	─ glm-5.3-flash (deepinfra):high · ◇ asks ─── $0.27 · 58% cached   66.8k/1.3M · 5%   idle   project: ~/src/parser ─
//	 › what changed in the relay this week
//
//	─ glm-5.3-flash:auto · ◇ asks ───────────────── project: ~/src/parser ─
//	 › type to search or start something new
//
// The first is a conversation's seam (foot.go's THE SEAM IS WHAT ANSWERS).
// The second is the rule over the box on home — the draft for a conversation
// that does not exist yet, and the one box on a place, because only home
// starts things (pages.go's [place.box]). Both begin with WHAT answers,
// HOW HARD it thinks, WHAT IT MAY RUN WITHOUT ASKING, and WHERE it runs.
// Home cycles the draft's project; a conversation names its workspace. The model is a door
// onto the model list, the rung walks the thinking ladder (`alt+e`, or a
// press), and the gate walks the approvals wheel (`alt+a`, or a press). One
// shape, learned once.
//
// ── WHY THE DRAFT CARRIES THE RUNG AND THE GATE ────────────────────────────
//
// Until this file the rule on home said the folder and the model and nothing
// else; `alt+a` and `alt+e` did nothing outside a conversation; and the
// `YOLO` word was a chip on one screen and a badge on another. A person who
// learned the seam in a conversation arrived on home and found nothing they
// knew. (The six other places had a box of their own then, under a note or a
// bare rule with a `here ~/codeaf` chip; those boxes are gone — only home
// starts things.)
//
// The draft is the right place for the two dials because the question a
// person has at home — "start this one on the big model, thinking hard, and
// stop asking me" — is a question about the conversation `enter` is about to
// open, and the only honest moment to answer it is before it opens. So the
// draft has a rung pin and a gate pin beside its model pin, moved by the same
// chords the conversation's cells answer to, and [app.applyTargetPins] puts
// all of them onto the conversation the box opens.
//
// ── WHAT STICKS AND WHAT IS SPENT ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The project, model and rung survive the conversation that uses them: they
// are preferences about where and how a person works. The GATE alone is spent:
// it is a safety claim about one conversation, never a default for every one
// after it. The cell is drawn always, so opening it again is one chord.
//
// ── WHAT THE UNPINNED CELLS SAY ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Both cells say what a fresh conversation WOULD run at on this install, and
// never what the conversation behind the screen is running at: the rung is
// the install's row folded with the level dialled onto the target model
// ([app.targetEffort]), and the gate is the rows as they stand, or the
// launch's `--yolo` ([session.Agent.StandingApprovalPosture]). A draft that
// echoed the conversation behind home would promise a gate the next
// conversation is not going to have.
//
// ── ABSENCE IS STILL ABSENCE ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A window whose session has no dial — a `--host` connection to an engine
// without the doors, a surface booted on an agent that cannot say the
// install's rung — draws neither cell on the draft, on effortchip.go's own
// terms: a control with nothing behind it is left off rather than drawn and
// refused. The folder and the model are still there; they never needed a
// dial. Over `--host` the two facts are the FAR install's, carried once at the
// door (internal/remote's [Welcome.DefaultEffort] and
// [Welcome.StandingApproval]), because a conversation started from a hosted
// home opens on that machine.

// draftDialer is what the draft asks of the window's session to say and set
// what the next conversation opens at. Both halves are asserted on the agent
// rather than added to [Agent]: a session without them simply has no cell.
