// A QUESTION HANGS ABOVE THE BOX AS ONE OBJECT (owner ruling 2026-09-11, frame
// pick A). It is the one drawing every question with anything to weigh gets —
// the model's own `ask`, a permission, a task proposal, a standing card, a
// landing, a confirmation — and the chooser (questionchooser.go) is what decides
// that a question has anything to weigh.

// THE FIVE DECISIONS THE OWNER MADE, AND WHERE EACH ONE IS:
//
//   - COLOUR IS STROKE (pick C). The three marks — `?`, the pointer `▸`, the
//     recommended `◆` — are amber; every word is ink, every aside dim, the edge
//     dim, and the focused row sits on the `selected` ground.
//     [TestNoQuestionRowIsPaintedInTheQuestionHue] is the law.
//   - THE PICK IS MARKED IN EVERY VIEW (pick A). `◆ recommended` stands at the
//     right edge of the picked row, and the pointer opens on it — except where
//     nobody but a person may answer, where the pointer opens on the answer that
//     loses nothing and the pick keeps its mark ([questionPointerStart]).
//   - ONE BOUNDARY OF KEYS. The bottom edge carries esc, o other and ? clarify.
//     Navigation still works; no extra hint or composer stands below the frame.
//   - YOUR OWN ANSWER IS A ROW (pick A). The last row is `something else…`, and
//     the pointer on it turns it into a box you type in. There is no hidden
//     `press c first`; `c` is a shortcut to that row.
//   - THE CLOCK IS AN ASIDE (pick A). It sits in the top edge's right, beside
//     who is asking, and never inside the keys.
