// THE INPUT STORM, AND THE ONE ANSWER IT IS ALLOWED.
//
// A pointer swept across this window sends ONE MESSAGE PER CELL it crosses. A
// slow diagonal over a hundred-column terminal is two hundred messages in the
// time it takes to move a hand; a fast one is six hundred, and they arrive in
// ONE WRITE — the terminal fills the pipe and the surface reads a burst.
//
// The positions in between are not information. They are the same claim, made
// six hundred times, and every one but the last of them was already false when
// it was read. So this file folds them: the newest position is kept, the rest
// are dropped, and the surface answers ONCE PER FRAME.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS TO ANSWER THEM ALL, MEASURED. Answering a motion is cheap now —
// reasoninglevel.go took the far machine out of the pointer's way, and PERF.md's
// "connection laws" hold it there. What is NOT cheap is that Bubble Tea builds a
// frame after every message it delivers and writes one every sixtieth of a
// second, so a burst is six hundred frames built for the sixty a person could
// possibly have seen. On the loopback client through a 20ms round trip, a
// character typed straight after a six-hundred-motion write took 45ms to appear
// and after three thousand, 204ms; with the fold, 13ms and 16ms — the same as
// with no motion at all. The BEFORE column is linear in the burst and the AFTER
// column is flat, which is the whole claim: THE COST OF A STORM NO LONGER
// DEPENDS ON HOW BIG THE STORM IS, and a per-message cost added back tomorrow
// cannot resurrect the stall.
//
// WHAT MAY NEVER BE FOLDED IS A KEY. Keys are meaning, one apiece, and they are
// ordered with respect to each other and to everything else — a `q` behind a
// `:` is a different message from a `q` in front of one. So no key is ever
// coalesced, none is ever reordered, and — the part that made this file worth
// writing — A KEY NEVER WAITS BEHIND A SWEEP. Folding a motion costs a struct
// copy and an integer, so the six hundredth motion of a storm and the keystroke
// behind it are handled in the same frame the keystroke arrived in.
// [TestSixHundredMotionsThenAKeyCostOneSweepAndTheKey] is that law, counted.
//
// WHY A FOLD AND NOT A DRAIN. internal/session's stream is folded by taking
// events off a channel until it would block (app.go's [waitEvent]), which is
// the honest way to coalesce a backlog: the backlog is IN HAND. A Bubble Tea
// program has no such channel to reach — `Program.msgs` is unbuffered and
// private, the input reader hands over one message at a time and blocks until
// the model has taken it, and the rest of a storm is unparsed bytes in the
// terminal's own pipe. There is nothing queued to drain and no way to look
// ahead. So the fold is made the only way it can be made from inside a model:
// forward, by keeping the newest position and answering it on a clock of its
// own.
//
// AND THE FIRST MOTION IS NEVER FOLDED. A pointer ARRIVING somewhere — the
// first motion after a key, a press, a frame, a token — is answered where it
// stands, instantly, with the whole of what it always cost and nothing added;
// it is the SECOND motion in a row that says a sweep is happening and opens the
// window the rest of it collapses into. Somebody moving a pointer onto a row
// and stopping pays nothing for this file. Somebody sweeping across the screen
// pays one answer per frame.

// pointerEvery is how often a sweeping pointer is answered. Bubble Tea writes
// at sixty frames a second, twice the surface's animation cadence, so half a
// [frameInterval] is the fastest answer the renderer can ordinarily show. A
// faster clock would build answers between writes; the animation clock itself
// leaves every other terminal write unused and makes hover visibly trail.
