// drawn. [readSwitcher] is handed [homeView.world] and walks `world.Projects`,
// and a bare workspace is not one of them — it lives in [homeView.bare], which
// only [homeView.everyProject] reads and only homephone.go calls. So at every
// width above the phone breakpoint a watch on a conversation-less workspace has
// no row on home AT ALL, even one stopped on a question. That is a hole in the
// production reading rather than a law this wave repealed, and it is reported
