// ── ctrl+w SHUTS THE TAB IN FRONT ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This file holds the claim [app.closeTabKey] makes — that the keyboard closes a
// tab exactly the way the ✕ on it does — and the four ways it could quietly stop
// being true: that it ends no work, that it keeps every draft, that the modal
// surfaces which spell ctrl+w their own way still get it, and that the two other
// names of the word kill still reach the message box.

// closeKeyApp is [tabApp]'s fixture with a handle on the agent IN FRONT, which
// is what the claims below about ending nothing are asserted against.
