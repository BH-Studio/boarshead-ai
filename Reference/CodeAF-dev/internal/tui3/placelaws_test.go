//
// [placeFootRows] is that foot at rest, counted where it is drawn: the blank
// over the rule, the rule with the note on it, the composer's [homeDraftFloor]
// rows and the hint. This law reads the number back off the frame rather than
// keeping a second copy of it, because a law that owned its own arithmetic
// would go on passing after the foot moved.
//
// THE COMPOSER IS THE SAME HEIGHT AT REST AS IN USE, which is what makes this
// number a constant at all. It was one row at rest and grew to three with what
// was typed into it; a box that changed height moved this whole foot under the

// LAW 4 · A PLACE NEVER READS THE DISK ON A DRAW — OR ON A KEYSTROKE.

// Every fact a place shows was read on the way in or on the three-second beat

// every resize and on every frame of an animation — which is how a still page
// ends up walking a directory sixty times a second.

// that reached a seam would reach it on every keystroke" is a sentence about
// keystrokes, and for one wave the test only walked `body`, `note` and `hint` —
// so the spend place's window arrows walked the standing store N+1 times per
// press, at key-repeat rate, with a law written against exactly that defect
// passing green. Everything a hand can do without asking for anything to happen
// is fenced here: the window arrows, the alt letters, the verbs a row offers,
// and the three things a pointer does. What is NOT fenced is `enter`, which is
// a person asking for something and is allowed to pay for it.
