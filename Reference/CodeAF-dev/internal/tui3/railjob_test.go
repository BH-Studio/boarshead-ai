// A BACKGROUND JOB IS NOT ON THE ROSTER, AND SAYS NOTHING IN THE CONVERSATION.
//
// These cases used to pin the opposite. A job was published through the ROSTER
// door as a [session.TaskNotice] of a `job` kind, drawn as a row among the task
// families with its log path underneath, and this file pinned the three refusals
// that arrangement then needed: no card, no ✕, and a log line the row grew
// because a job had nowhere else to carry one.
//
// The arrangement is gone. A job publishes itself (session's jobnotice.go), is
// kept apart from the nodes (jobstate.go) and is drawn in a section of its own
// (jobsview.go), where it has a name, a clock and a page with a stop on it.
//
// SO WHAT IS LEFT HERE IS WHAT THE OTHER FILES CANNOT SEE. jobsview_test.go
// tests a pure function and never holds a window, so it cannot say whether a job
// reached the roster or wrote into the conversation. Those two are facts about
// this window's own wiring, and they are the two this file keeps.
