// taskconversation.go draws a PROGRAM'S task page as the actions it took.
//
// A task a run handed to a program codeaf carries (senior-dev first) is a
// process with steps of its own, and the page shows the program doing it: each
// thing it did, under the step of its process that action served, with how it
// came out at the right edge — not a dialogue between the program and a model,
// which made a pipeline of spec, exploration, a pinned check, a checklist, an
// implementation, a hand-in and its own check of the tree read like one chat.
//
//	BRIEF      rewrite the auth middleware to use the new session store
//	SETUP      set up its workspace                               git
//	SPEC       wrote your brief down as its spec
//	EXPLORE    read internal/auth/middleware.go
//	           ran go test ./internal/auth/...             fails · exit 1
//	IMPLEMENT  edited internal/auth/middleware.go
//	           compacted its memory
//	           ◐ thinking · 12s
//
// THE ACTIONS ARE THE PROGRAM'S, IN ITS OWN WORDS. The run keeps every stage,
// step and ending the program reported, stamped as codeaf received it, and the
// program's own vocabulary reads them (internal/delegate's Present; senior-dev's
// is internal/seniordev's actions.go) before the page ever holds them. What only
// the program's calls to a model know is merged in by time: a history rewritten
// as a summary is `compacted its memory` (once, when the program said so too), a
// change of the model answering is `switched to <model>` with the program's
// reason when it gave one, and a call refused or failed is one plain line. A
// model is named nowhere else on the page; the cost and the clock stay on the
// pinned line. The raw calls are one key away (programcalls.go,
// [programCallsKey]).
//
// THE PAGE READS NOTHING. Every line here is drawn from the page the surface
// already holds ([session.PlanTaskPage.Program], read off the loop on the page's
// own beat), with the frame's own clock for the two figures that tick — the
// run's age and the call in flight's. The texts arrive cut to their first line
// with the run's copy taken out of their paths (internal/session's
// plandb_program.go), so a row here is a choice of which line to show and never
// a reading of the record.
