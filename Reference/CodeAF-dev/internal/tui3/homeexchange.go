// ASK HERE: the errand you say from home, and the record it leaves.
//
// "remind me at 6" is a sentence a person says from wherever they happen to be
// standing, and the place they are usually standing is home. It is not a
// project conversation and it is not a single question either — getting to a
// card takes a tool call or two and a sentence back and forth — so the two
// answers that were already on the screen were both wrong. Typing it and
// pressing enter started a whole conversation, and home's list filled up with
// one-off errands that were finished; a chat that was simply not stored would
// have been worse, because "why did I get this reminder?" must open the thing
// that made it (docs/AMBIENT.md Part 5).
//
// So there is a THIRD door, and this file is all of it:
//
//   - A second action row, `ask here`, drawn directly above
//     `start a new conversation` while something is typed. It is one ↑ away and
//     it is also a chord — ctrl+enter, with alt+enter as the spelling terminals
//     that cannot send the first one do send (input.go's alt+enter/ctrl+j pair
//     is the same law about the same key).
//   - A REAL session.Agent behind it, built through the door's own seam
//     ([Options.Errand]) with its transcript in a folder under the standing
//     root rather than under v3/projects — so home never lists it, and the
//     record still exists.
//   - A ROW IN THE LEFT COLUMN for every exchange, in its project's block where
//     the hot things go, wearing what it is doing right now — `working`,
//     `waiting on you`, `stood`. It is a cursor stop like any other row.
//   - The exchange itself in home's RIGHT PANE **while the cursor is on that
//     row**: the person's line, the reply as it streams, one line per tool call,
//     a live strip of what is happening this second, and the ratification card
//     when one arrives. Answering it is 1 / 2 / 3, a follow-up is typing and
//     enter, and esc puts the keyboard back on the list with the exchange still
//     alive beside it.
//
// ── AN EXCHANGE IS A ROW, AND IT OUTLIVES THE SCREEN IT WAS ASKED ON ────────
//
// It used to live on [homeView], which [app.closeHome] assigns the zero value
// to — so opening another conversation to check something ended the errand
// mid-question, and the engine answered the card nobody could see any more with
// "the card was left unanswered — nothing was set up". The exchange DIED
// because somebody looked elsewhere. So the list of them is on the APP
// ([app.exchanges]), home merely draws it, and the four rules are:
//
//	several at once   a second `ask here` ADDS one; nothing is replaced
//	the pane is the ROW's   the exchange pane is drawn only while the cursor is
//	                        on an exchange row, so every other row keeps its
//	                        ordinary card
//	it never dies of neglect   closing home, walking away, opening another
//	                           conversation — none of them touch the agent
//	it goes when it is over AND SEEN   a settled exchange is filed once its pane
//	                                   has been drawn after it settled and the
//	                                   cursor has left it ([app.sweepExchanges])
//
// WHERE THE FOLDER LIVES, AT EVERY STAGE. There is one folder and it only ever
// MOVES; nothing here copies a transcript and nothing here deletes one.
//
//	made          <standing root>/exchanges/<16-hex id>/transcript.jsonl
//	came to a thing that stands   <standing root>/<item id>/exchange/
//	                              ([standing.Store.ExchangeDir], on "stood")
//	promoted to a conversation    <project bucket>/<16-hex id>/  with meta.json
//	came to nothing               it stays where it was made, and the sweep law
//	                              reaps it after standing.RunKeep
//
// THE AGENT IS CLOSED BEFORE THE FOLDER MOVES, always. The transcript's flock
// rides the open file and a rename carries the inode with it, so a folder moved
// under a live writer would leave a lock held on a path nobody can name.
//
// AND THE MOVE THEREFORE WAITS FOR THE END OF THE EXCHANGE. "stood" arrives
// MID-TURN — the tool call that raised it is still running — so closing the
// agent there cancelled the turn in flight and parked the update loop on
// [session.Agent.Close]'s grace period, which is what a person feels as the
// screen going dead just after they said yes. So a stood exchange only
// REMEMBERS the item it made ([homeExchange.itemID]); the agent stays open,
// follow-ups keep working, and the folder is filed under the item when the
// exchange is FILED ([app.fileExchange]) — swept off the list after it settled
// and was seen, or taken with the window on the way out — after the agent has
// been closed there.

// and backticks to a person who asked a question from home — the same output
// that reads as prose two keystrokes away in a conversation. So it goes through
// [app.renderMarkdown], which is the door render.go's [app.settledMarkdown]
// opens for the transcript: one parser, one styler, one measure, one answer to
// what a sixteen-colour terminal may draw. Adapting it costs a line; a second
// renderer here would be a second heading ladder drifting from the first
// (markdown.go's own header says why).
//
// THE NARROW COLUMN IS ALREADY ANSWERED BY THAT DOOR. The pane is thirty to
// fifty cells, which is [tierPhone], and [phoneMarkdown] is the tier that wraps
// a fence instead of cutting it and stacks a table instead of fitting it —
// written for exactly this case, a reader with no horizontal scroll.
//
// A REPLY STILL ARRIVING STAYS PLAIN, and that is the transcript's behaviour
// rather than a shortcut: render.go's [app.liveTail] wraps the growing edge
// without parsing it, because markdown of a half-written sentence re-flows
// under the reader's eye. This pane has no promotion throttle — the head that
// chat promotes every [markdownThrottle] is a few hundred bytes here, and the
// whole block formats the instant the boundary settles it.
//
// It memoizes nothing, for [renderMarkdown]'s own reason: the pane redraws on a
