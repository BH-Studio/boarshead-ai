// ── THE ATTENTION RULES, WHICH ARE THE SORT ORDER NOW ───────────────────────
//
// This file used to be about TWO STRIPS standing over the list — `needs you`
// and `moving` — and about the four things that made them worth their rows:
// everything blocked gathered in one place whatever kind of thing it was, the
// order being how long each had been standing still, a busy machine folding
// rather than filling the screen, and a row in a strip being the same live
// object as the row under its project.
//
// THE STRIPS ARE GONE AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE FOUR IS STILL TRUE — of the one
// flat ranked list itself (homeattention.go states the change). So each test
// here asks the same question of the new screen: the longest wait is the FIRST
// ROW rather than the first row of a strip, one thing has ONE row rather than
// two, the cap and its door belong to the whole list rather than to a zone, and
// a row of the list answers a digit and walks a door exactly as a strip row did.

// switchRowLine is the drawn frame row that carries a name, which is what turns
// "the word is somewhere on the screen" into "the row for that thing looks like
// this". It answers the empty string when nothing on the frame names it.
