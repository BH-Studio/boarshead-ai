// WORK NOTHING IS DOING IS NOT `running`, AND THE TWO SURFACES SAY ONE WORD.
//
// The tasks place carries one liveness answer per row ([tasksItem.runs]) and it
// is true of a node that is merely ADMITTED as much as of one a worker is inside.
// So the two nodes waiting behind the piece that needs a person were drawn under
// `running`, dated `now`, and counted `2 running` in the foot — on a machine
// where nothing at all was executing — while the column one keypress away called
// the same two nodes `2 parked`.
