// THE PARKED MESSAGE: what plain enter does while an answer is still coming.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS FILE EXISTS FOR. A person watched a long answer stream, typed
// "do much more of a deep research please" and pressed enter — and their
// sentence was drawn INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE ANSWER, sandwiched between two
// paragraphs of the same flowing reply. It read as though the model had quoted
// them mid-thought. Worse, the words often went nowhere: enter sent the line
// straight to the session as steering, and the session's steering only reaches
// the model AT A STEP BOUNDARY — so a message typed at a turn whose last request
// has already gone out lands in the transcript with nothing left to answer it.
//
// So plain enter no longer sends while a turn is open. IT PARKS: the message is
// held HERE, on the surface, in its own block between the answer and the box,
// and it goes when the answer is finished — as a turn of its own, which is a
// turn the model always answers. Held on the surface rather than handed to the
// session is what makes the other things possible: it can still be edited or
// taken back, and a conversation switch can keep it with the turn it follows.
//
//	enter    park it. The answer keeps streaming, the box is clear again.
//	ctrl+c   stop the answer and drop what is parked.
//	↑        with an empty box, pull the parked message back in to edit it.
//	click    the same, on the block itself.
//
// AND THE FIRST TWO OF THOSE AS ONE ACT: `ctrl+shift+enter` parks the draft and
// stops the answer in one gesture, which is the way somebody actually
// interrupts — by speaking (bargein.go). It is built ON this queue rather than
// beside it, so everything below is what happens to the message afterwards.
//
// ONE AT A TIME, in the order they were typed — the session's own law for its
// follow-up queue (internal/session's agent.go), said about this queue: each
// finished turn sends exactly one parked message, and the rest wait for the end
// of the turn that one starts. A drain that started three turns at once, or
// spliced three sentences into one message, would be a decision nobody made.
//
// ctrl+enter is still its own key and still means something else: a follow-up
// is handed to the SESSION the moment it is typed (followup.go) — and, since
// 2026-09-30, one that can be taken back out of the session's queue before its
// turn starts. A parked message is still yours until it goes.

// parked is one message typed while a turn was open: the words, and the
// pictures that were in the tray with them.
//
// The chips travel with it because the tray is emptied when enter is pressed —
// the person has moved on from attaching — and a parked message that lost its
// pictures on the way would make them go and find the files again.
