// ── WHAT THIS WINDOW KNOWS ABOUT ITS BACKGROUND JOBS ────────────────────────
//
// A background job — a server, a build, a sweep, a watch, a render — is not a
// task and never was. It has no agent inside it, no room, no worktree, no
// branch, no report anybody wrote and no price. What it has is a number, a
// command, a log file, a clock and, when it is over, an exit code.
//
// IT USED TO BE KEPT ON THE TASK SIDE, and that is the defect this file is half
// of. Jobs arrived as [session.TaskNotice] of a `job` kind, were filed among the
// nodes, drawn among the task families, and then excluded again — one clause at
// a time — from the project index, the landing card, the stop key, the roster's
// under-line and the room's record rows. Five exclusions is what it costs to
// keep a thing in a list it does not belong in.
//
// SO THIS WINDOW KEEPS ITS JOBS ITSELF, off [session.EventJobUpdate], and the
// two surfaces that draw them — the column's section (jobsection.go) and a
// job's own page (jobpage.go) — read the slice below and nothing else.
//
// THIS FILE HOLDS STATE AND NOTHING ELSE. It files what arrives and answers the
// counting questions the section's label asks. It draws nothing, reads no disk
// and formats no string a person sees; those belong to the two files above, and
// the pure half of the drawing (jobsview.go) is written to take this slice as an
// argument so it can be tested with no window at all.

// jobUpdate files one job's news, and reports whether anything actually moved.
//
// THE WINDOW REDRAWS ON NEWS AND NOT ON ARRIVAL. A job publishes when it starts,
// when its name lands and when it settles, and the engine may republish a state
// this window already holds — so the caller is told whether the frame is stale
// rather than being made to guess. That is the same rule the task side's own
// upsert is written under.
//
// A TASK'S OWN WORKER IS NOT A JOB HERE. Task nodes live in the job registry for
// the id space, the log and the kill, and the engine already declines to publish
// them ([session.JobKindTask] says why: the work has a roster row of its own and
// a second one would be the same piece of work counted twice). The guard is kept
// on this side as well, because a surface that trusted a sender to filter is a
// surface that breaks the day a second sender appears.

	// which end it reads from, what it folds — is the section's own business.

// dropJobs forgets this conversation's background jobs, which is what /new and a

// to the conversation that started it — its log lives under that session's own
// folder, its number is that session's registry's — so a section carried into
// the next conversation would be a list of work that conversation never ran,
// counted in its label and openable onto a page reading somebody else's log.
// That is the same reason the roster drops its nodes here (task.go's
// [app.dropTasks]), said about the other kind of work.
//
// THE PAGE GOES WITH THEM for the roster's own reason: a page is one job's
// record, and a job that left with its conversation is a page that can be
// neither read nor stopped.
//
// THE FOLD GOES TOO. Whether the section was open is a fact about a list that
// no longer exists, and the next conversation opens its own — collapsed, which

// is why the one fact they share lives here with the rest of the state.

// showJobPage opens one job's page, or does nothing at all for a job this window
// has never been told about.
//
// A PAGE IS NEVER OPENED ONTO NOTHING. An id with no job behind it is a row that
// was drawn from a reading this window no longer holds, and a page opened on it
// would draw a header with no name, a clock with no start and a log with no
// path — three absences the emptiness law would have to explain one at a time.
// Refusing here means the page can be written as though its job exists, because
// it does.

// are what the NEXT page would open showing (jobpage.go's [jobDraw]).

	a.jobPage = 0
	a.jobDraw = nil

// started, because that is the order a person set it going in and a row that
// jumped would be unreadable. History reads newest first, because the useful end
// of a list of finished things is the recent end — and because the section shows
