// THE EVIDENCE AN ASKER ATTACHES, DRAWN AT THE SIZE IT NEEDS.
//
// docs/design/questions/DESIGN.md, rung five of the ladder: "show outcomes —
// attach what each answer produces (a diff, a rendered row, a layout)". A
// question with a diff under each answer is a question a person answers in four
// seconds; the same question with the diffs described in prose is one they
// answer by asking to see the diffs.
//
// SIX KINDS AND NO SEVENTH ([session.BlockKind]). Each one is drawn by the rule
// its content already carries and never by a rule invented here:
//
//   - text — prose, wrapped to the block's own indent.
//   - diagram — PRE-FORMATTED and drawn as-is. Its lines mean what they are; a
//     wrap would destroy it, so a diagram wider than the page is cut at the edge
//     with the ellipsis every other cut line on this surface wears.
//   - table — [session.Block.Rows], first row the header, columns sized from the
//     content and cut evenly when the page is narrow.
//   - diff — the diff glyphs and tokens ([tokens.GDiffAdd]/[tokens.GDiffDel],
//     [palette.add]/[palette.del]), which is toolview.go's own painting said
//     again here because a diff must look the same wherever this program draws
//     one.
//   - image — the surface's existing picture path ([app.pictureRowsFor]), which
//     is the same renderer, cache and half-cell painting a picture in the
//     conversation gets. A terminal that cannot paint gets the path and `o open`.
//   - layout — two pre-formatted panes side by side wherever both fit whole,
//     stacked where they do not, because a pane cut to fit is a pane that has
//     stopped being pre-formatted.
//
// ── NO BOX DRAWING ──
//
// DESIGN.md's hue law: "no box drawing except the room's rule lines and blocks
// the asker drew". So a block is a dim title and its content indented under it,
// and the only lines on the page are the ones inside a diagram the asker drew
// themselves. A frame around every block would put four rows of furniture around
// three rows of evidence on a question with four answers.

const (
	// questionBlockRows is how tall one block may be before it is cut. It is the
	// same instinct the tool expansion's budget is: evidence is worth a screenful
	// and no more, because past that it is the page rather than the evidence.

	// reason: several answers may each carry one.

	// nobody can open, which is imagepreview.go's own stated rule.
