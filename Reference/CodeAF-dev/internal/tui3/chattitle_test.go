// WHAT A CONVERSATION IS CALLED BEFORE IT HAS EARNED A NAME, AND WHEN THE NAME
// ARRIVES.
//
// A session starts naming itself asynchronously on its first accepted message
// (internal/session's title.go states the retry and lifetime bounds). While the
// name is being written, the name column has to say SOMETHING — and what
// it said was `main`, which is this surface's word for a PLACE (`esc/← main`,
// [refusalMainDoor]'s "say it to main") and not a name at all. A person with one
// unnamed conversation open read a tab claiming their chat was called `main`.
//
// These tests pin the two halves of the fix that are the title lifecycle's own:
// the word an unnamed conversation is drawn under, and the arrival of the real
// name on the event the namer already sends. NOTHING HERE MAY MAKE A MODEL CALL
// AND NOTHING IN THE SURFACE DOES — the second half is a field being written by
// [session.EventTitleChanged] and read on the next frame.

// The unnamed conversation is drawn under the SAME word the switcher and entry
// line use, and never under the word this surface uses for the conversation as
// a place.
