// ── THE COMPOSER LAYER — the three facts a task needs before it leaves ──────

// on the spot: it opens a LAYER over whatever place a person is standing on.

//	 alt+enter send it off · enter talk about it first · esc back to spend
//
// THE PAGE BEHIND DIMS RATHER THAN BEING COVERED, which is the whole reason this
// is a layer and not an eighth place: you never lose your place, the box does not
// move by a single cell, and the three lines appear in the air that was already
// under it. The fade is the depth ladder this surface already has
// (depthfade.go's [palette.fade]) taken at its FAINTEST stop, so nothing new is
// authored to say "behind".
//
// ── THE THREE FACTS, AND WHY THESE THREE ────────────────────────────────────
//
// Where, on what, how much. They are the only three a task needs settled before
// it leaves, and each is edited ON THE LINE THAT SHOWS IT — the same law the
// money segment in the status line already follows, and the reason there is no
// settings page anywhere in this gesture.
//
// Each of them is also a REAL FIELD of the session the door builds, carried on
// [ErrandOrders] and honoured in cmd/codeaf's v3Errand: the workspace it works
// in, the model its work runs on (config's execution slot), and the spend rail
// it stops at. A figure a person set and nothing read would be worse than a
// figure they were never offered.
//
// ── AND A KEY IS DRAWN ONLY WHERE IT DOES SOMETHING ─────────────────────────
//
// SCREEN 3a's clause is in force here as everywhere: `alt+p to move it` is
// absent on a machine with one project, because there is nowhere to move it to,
// and the model line is absent when nothing anywhere can say what execution runs
// on. A layer that named three keys and bound two would be the exact defect this
// design exists to avoid.
//
// ── THE ERRAND STILL LANDS ON HOME ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Sending from the spend place still CARRIES YOU TO HOME, because home's column
// is the only surface that draws an errand's answer ([app.showExchanges]) and
// work started somewhere a person cannot watch it is the one failure worse than
// saying no ([app.askHere]). Making the exchange a band the frame draws over
// every place is the router's open question and is a wave of its own; until it
// lands, the manual says plainly where you end up (places.md).

// composerCapDefault is the figure the third line opens on, and it is the tank
// the engine actually applies when nobody names one.
//
// IT IS NOW ONE NUMBER AND NOT TWO. This file used to spell the figure itself,
// with a comment asking whoever changed the engine to remember to change the
// surface — and that is precisely the arrangement the one-source-of-truth law
// forbids, because the reminder is only ever read by somebody who already knew.
// [session.DefaultRunCapUSD] is the figure; this name is kept so the rest of
// the layer reads the way it always did.
const composerCapDefault = session.DefaultRunCapUSD

// composerLayer is the layer's whole state. The zero value is closed.
type composerLayer struct {
	open bool
	// at is the place the layer was opened on, so `esc` goes back to THAT place
	// rather than to whichever one a stray key walked to. Nothing can walk while
	// the layer is up — it holds the keyboard — and holding the id anyway is what
	// lets the foot name the place by its own word.
	at page
	// where is the destination `alt+p` last cycled to, and "" is "wherever the
	// plain door would have sent it" ([app.errandPlace]). It is a PATH and not an

	// project that appeared between two keystrokes would otherwise shift the
	// cursor's meaning under the person's hand.
	where string
	// model is the execution model `alt+o` chose, and "" is the launch's own
	// binding — which is the ordinary case and the one the line still reads
	// truthfully, because an unpinned execution slot follows the conversation
	// (internal/session's defaultTaskModel).
	model string
	// capText is the digits typed on the third line, and "" is the default. It is
	// the SPELLING and not the figure: a person half way through typing `2.` has
	// something on the screen that is not yet a number, and a float that rounded
	// their keystrokes back at them would be a box that fights the hand.
	capText string
	// places is everywhere this task can be sent, READ ONCE ON THE WAY IN and
	// held. The list is a walk of the projects root ([app.readWorld]) and a walk
	// is a thing a keystroke may do and a draw may not (ARCHITECTURE.md's fourth
	// law) — and holding it is also what makes `alt+p` a cycle rather than a
	// lottery, because a project that appeared between two presses cannot shift
	// what the next one means.

	// pick is the model list, opened by `alt+o` over the execution slot. It is
