// TASK MENTIONS: "@" ALSO MEANS WORK SOMEBODY DID.
//
// files.go says what "@" was — a way to put a path in a sentence without typing
// it — and the rule it holds to is that the surface inserts TEXT and resolves
// nothing. This file adds the second kind of thing a person points at with the
// same key, and it holds to the same rule for a harder reason.
//
// A TASK IS NOT A FILE, AND POINTING AT ONE CANNOT BE INSERTING ITS CONTENTS.
// The work is a worktree, a branch and a whole session journal — tens of
// thousands of tokens if anybody were foolish enough to inline it. So what a
// chosen task becomes in the sentence is a POINTER BLOCK: six facts and two
// URIs, written where the person can read them, with the model's own hands
// (read, bash) left to follow either URI if the answer needs more than the
// facts. That is the same trade files.go makes, one size up.
//
// ── THE THREE PARTS ──
//
//   - THE LIST. The project's task index (internal/session's task_index.go),
//     ranked against whatever follows the "@", drawn ABOVE the files because a
//     person who half-remembers a piece of work has fewer other ways to find it
//     than a person who half-remembers a filename. Sectioned by WHEN, because
//     "the one that is running" and "the one from last week" are two different
//     questions and a single recency-sorted list answers neither well.
//   - THE INSERTION. Choosing a row types "@<slug>" — the task's title,
//     kebab-cased. It is derived from the title rather than minted, so it is a
//     name a person can type from memory without having opened the list at all
//     (session.TaskSlug says why).
//   - THE EXPANSION. At submit, every "@<slug>" that names a task in the index
//     grows a pointer block, appended after the sentence. The token STAYS where
//     it was typed: the sentence is what the person wrote, and the block is the
//     footnote under it.
//
// ── WHAT THE MODEL SEES IS WHAT THE PERSON SEES ──
//
// The expansion happens before the message is submitted AND before it lands in
// the transcript, so the block is on screen exactly as it went on the wire.
// This surface has one law about the box (files.go: "what is submitted is the
// text as typed") and appending something invisible to a person's own message
// would be the first breach of it. Nothing here is silent.
