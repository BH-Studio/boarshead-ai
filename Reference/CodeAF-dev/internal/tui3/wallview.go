// ── THE WALL, PAINTED ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This is the painting half of the wall (wallcontract.go): pure functions from
// a [wallView] to rows. Nothing here reads a clock, a file or the app. The time
// is v.now, the motion is v.spin, and everything a tile says was put on it by
// the reading half.
//
// The frame reads top to bottom as one hierarchy. A title bar says what this
// is and what the conversations on it are doing; under it the Teams control
// says which set is shown; a rule and a blank row close the head. Then the
// grid, and last the foot, the head mirrored: a blank row, a rule, and the
// toolbar (wallbar.go), whose free middle says what the control under the
// pointer does. The head and the foot end where the grid ends. Three cards can
// float over the grid: the selection tray while conversations are picked, the
// new-team card while one is named, and the Organize card while suggestions
// are up (teamorganize.go); and the help sheet (wallhelp.go) floats over
// everything while it is up.
//
// The words on screen are the person's words: a Conversation is a tile, a
// Team is a named set of them. "wall" and "tab" are this code's names and are
// never drawn.
//
// A TILE READS TITLE, STATE, NOW, HISTORY. The title is the brightest thing
// in it; one dim line under it says what the agent is doing or when it last
// moved; the body under that is the conversation's own rows, faded with age
// by the reading half (wallmini.go), so the newest rows are where the eye
// lands.
//
// A TILE HAS ONE STATE LADDER AND EVERY STEP MAKES ONE CLAIM:
//
//	rest       a dim rounded border and no ground
//	hover      the whole tile on the cursor ground, the border lifted to muted,
//	           and its action row drawn on the bottom border
//	focus      the heavy border; weight, never colour; and the action row
//	selected   the selected ground, a step above hover, and a ☑ at top left
//	needs you  the amber border, and the only amber on the wall; its body
//	           ends in the question and an Answer button
//
// THE ACTIONS ARE WORDS, NOT GLYPHS. A tile's bottom border carries a
// sparkline at rest, and under the pointer or the keyboard's focus it becomes
// a row of labelled buttons, each a verb and its key (wallbar.go's
// [wallTileActs]). The buttons' cells depend on the tile's width alone, so
// nothing moves as the row appears. The ☐ is drawn only in the selection
// mode, on every tile, where the mode itself says what a box is for.

// wallChromeRows is what the frame spends outside the grid. The head is the
// title bar, the Teams row, a rule and a blank row; the foot mirrors it, a
// blank row, a rule and the toolbar, so the grid sits between two matching
// edges and no tile touches a control.
