// ── REOPENING A TAB YOU JUST SHUT ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// reopenTabChord is `ctrl+shift+t`, and it is the third key of the browser's own
// tab grammar: `ctrl+t` opens one (chatstart.go), `ctrl+w` shuts one
// (tabclosekey.go), and this one puts the last thing you shut back. A person who
// closed the wrong tab reaches for it without being told to, and until this wave
// the only way back was to remember which conversation it had been and find it
// again on `alt+k`.
//
// A held local conversation returns with its draft through the keeper. A
// remembered remote conversation resumes through the existing connection's open
// door, with its normal session-switch semantics. Refusal leaves the entry on
// the stack so the same key can retry it.
//
// ── WHAT IS ON THE STACK, AND WHAT DELIBERATELY IS NOT ──────────────────────
//
// The stack is [app.closedTabs]: the conversations whose tab this window shut, in
// the order it shut them, most recent last. Pressing the chord repeatedly walks
// back through them in reverse closure order.
//
// THE NEW-CHAT PAGE IS NOT ON IT. Its tab is synthetic — nothing has been created
// yet, so it has no key, no transcript and no conversation to come back to — and
// closing it parks its half-written first message through
// [app.cancelChatStart], which `ctrl+t` hands straight back the next time the
// page opens. So the page's own way back is the chord that made it, and putting
// an empty key on this stack would only make the chord skip a turn.
//
// ── AND THE KEY IS THE ONE THE TERMINAL ACTUALLY SENDS ──────────────────────
//
// This chord is matched on [tea.KeyPressMsg.String], which spells a shifted
// control key `ctrl+shift+t`. A terminal that cannot tell `ctrl+shift+t` from
// `ctrl+t` sends the latter and gets a NEW CHAT, which is what that key has
// always done here: this file never claims `ctrl+t`, because a key that opened a
// tab on one terminal and reopened a different one on the next is a key nobody
// can predict. Where the distinct event does arrive it is answered whatever the
// terminal negotiated — nothing here asks for a keyboard protocol flag. The
// manual says so on the key sheet rather than leaving it to be discovered.
const reopenTabChord = "ctrl+shift+t"

// reopenTabKey is that chord's whole claim on the keyboard, and it reports
// whether it took the key.
//
// IT IS READ AT [app.closeTabKey]'S RUNG (input.go) — under every modal, panel
// and page, and over the message box — because it is that gesture's inverse and
// the two must not be reachable in different places. It TAKES the key with an
// empty stack as well: there is nothing to reopen, and a chord that fell through
// to the box would be a chord whose effect depended on how many tabs you had shut.
//
// IT ANSWERS FROM A HELD ROSTER, on [app.newChatKey]'s reason: the screen about
// to be drawn is a different conversation, and a keyboard pointed at a list
// nobody can see is the bug chordfocus.go states.
