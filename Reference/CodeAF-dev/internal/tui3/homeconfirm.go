// ── A QUESTION HOME ASKS ABOUT A ROW ON ITS OWN LIST ─────────────────────────
//
// Home takes the frame WHOLE (view.go's [app.placeFrameNow]), so the question
// block pinned above the message box is not on the screen at all while somebody
// is standing here. Up to now that meant home could not ASK anything: the two
// doors on this screen that end something — moving a conversation out of another
// window, and answering a standing card — each grew their own way of asking, and
// each of them was a different set of keys for the same act.
//
// This is the seam that ends that. Home holds ONE question at a time, draws it
// with the block's own renderer, and routes its keys through the block's own
// router. Nothing about the grammar is re-decided here.
//
// ── THE ROWS, EXACTLY AS THEY ARE DRAWN ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// Inside the card beside the list, where the state band already says what the
// other window is doing:
//
//	?  Move this conversation here?
//	     its reply stops there; its tasks come here
//	     1  move it here
//	   ▸ 2  leave it there
//	   [esc] leave it there · [←→] pick
//
// The cursor starts on `leave it there`, which is stop.go's law and the reason
// this seam was worth building: `enter` is the key people press to make a
// question go away, so the answer under it has to be the one that loses nothing.
//
// And on a frame too narrow for a card at all (below [homeCardMin]) the same
// question is home's foot line, in one row, cut by the same fitter every other
// long sentence on this screen is cut by ([app.homeAskFoot]):
//
//	Move this conversation here? · 1 move it here · 2 leave it there · its reply stops there; its tasks come here · esc leave it there
//
// ── THE FOUR THINGS IT PROMISES ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   - ONE AT A TIME. Home is a list of rows and a card about the row under the
//     cursor; a second question would be a card about two things. Raising one
//     drops whatever was there.
//   - IT IS NOT ON THE BLOCK. [app.questions] is the conversation's queue, drawn
//     above the message box, and a card home raised about a row on home is not a
//     thing to meet after walking away from home. Answering it or walking off
//     the row takes it down.
//   - IT NEVER TAKES A KEY IT HAS NOT DRAWN. The band is only drawn for the row
//     the cursor is on, so the card is taken down the moment the cursor moves —
//     which is the same guard the block spends its `shown` stamp on.
//   - AND IT ANSWERS THROUGH THE CLOSURE, never through a door. Everything home
//     asks about is something THIS PROGRAM does ([questionShown.local]), so
//     there is no engine to tell and no receipt to write: the act is the receipt
//     (question.go's [app.recordQuestion] says the same about every card a
//     person raises themselves).

	// THE STAMP IS WRITTEN AT THE RAISE AND NOT AT THE DRAW, which is the one
