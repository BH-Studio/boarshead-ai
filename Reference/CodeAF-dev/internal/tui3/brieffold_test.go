// A person who walks into a node's page went there to watch work happen. The
// first block on that page is the brief the node was given, and on a long one it
// was the whole page: sixty lines of assignment above the first tool call. These
// tests hold the fold that answers it — what is on screen when it is shut, that
// the number on its door is true, that both hands reach it, that opening shows
// everything and shuts again — and the two refusals around it: a short
// instruction gets no door at all, and nothing about this is allowed to cost a
// person a keystroke while they are typing.
