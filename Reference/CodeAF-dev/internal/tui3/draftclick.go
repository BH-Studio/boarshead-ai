// A CLICK ON THE BOX PUTS THE CARET UNDER THE POINTER.
//
// Every text field a person has ever used answers a click this way, and this
// one did not: a press on the draft fell through to the body's drag parking and
// moved nothing, so the one place on the surface where somebody is actually
// writing was the one place their pointer was dead. The input's rows now carry
// their own chrome mark (view.go's chromeDraft), and this file is the other
// half — turning the marked row and the pointer's column back into a rune
// offset through the SAME layout arithmetic the frame drew the block with
// (input.go's draftWindow), so the caret lands on the letter the person aimed
// at and not on a neighbour computed by a second copy of the wrap.

// draftPress answers a click that landed on the input block, and reports
// whether it took it. Only the MAIN draft answers: while an overlay's filter or
// edit box is standing in the input's position (the picker, memory, resume, the
// subharness card, the files shelf, the connections panel, the rewind bar), the
// keyboard is pointed somewhere else and a caret moved under it would be a
// caret in a box the person is not in.
//
// THE THINKING LADDER IS IN THAT LIST FOR THE SAME REASON READ ONE STEP EARLIER
// (effortchip.go). Its rows hang ABOVE the box rather than in it, so the draft
// is still on the frame — but every key belongs to the ladder while it is up, so
// a caret placed under the pointer would be a caret nothing can move.
