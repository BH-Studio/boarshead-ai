// ── THE HEADER IS THE INSTRUMENT ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A person comes to a task to steer and to check, and the check is one glance
// at a fixed number of cells at the top of the frame. So the header carries the
// judgment and accountability acts whole — the verb, the elapsed, the spend, the
// call count and the live line — and it degrades by what a person is reading it
// for rather than by cutting from the right (room.go's [app.roomHeadWord]).
//
// These pin the three things that can quietly stop being true: that every
// figure is there while it is known, that no figure is there while it is not
// (the emptiness law, per segment), and that a narrow frame loses the tail
// rather than the name.
