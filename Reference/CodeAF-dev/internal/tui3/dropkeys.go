// A DROP IS A DROP IN WHATEVER SHAPE THE TERMINAL SENDS IT.
//
// imagepaste.go reads a dragged file the way most terminals deliver one: a
// BRACKETED PASTE holding the file's escaped path, which arrives as one
// tea.PasteMsg and goes through [app.paste]. That has been true and working for
// a while, and it is why the chip machinery already understands escaped spaces,
// quotes, `file://` URLs and several files in one gesture.
//
// IT IS NOT THE ONLY SHAPE. Some terminals — and some multiplexers in front of
// them — deliver the same gesture as KEYSTROKES: the path is TYPED into the
// program, one tea.KeyPressMsg per character, with no bracket around it at all.
// Nothing above notices, because nothing above is looking at keys. So the path
// went into the draft as text, its leading `/` put the composer into command
// mode, and enter walked the whole thing into the slash router, which answered
// what it answers about any word it does not know:
//
//	unknown command: /var/folders/…/Screenshot · try /help
//
// That is what the owner met on a real terminal over `--host`, twice, on the
// same screenshot. The parsing was never the problem — the same bytes delivered
// as a paste attach perfectly. THE DELIVERY SHAPE WAS.
//
// So this file gives the keystroke shape the same door. It watches for a run of
// characters that spells a path, and when the run goes quiet it hands what it
// found to [app.pasteFilesInto] — the same function, the same tray, the same
// chips, the same hosted upload. There is no second tagging system and no second
// idea of what a dropped file is.
//
// AND IT WATCHES WHICHEVER BOX HAS THE KEYBOARD. The fold was the conversation
// draft's alone, so the one screen a person is most likely to be looking at when
// they drag something in — home, fullscreen, with its own line at the foot —
// held the raw path until enter caught it, filtering its list by a path no
// conversation matches while it sat there. The fold carries the box it is
// watching now, and one box at a time: home's line, the errand pane's and the
// draft are three boxes and a person types into exactly one of them.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS, AND THE LAW THAT KEEPS IT THERE. PERF.md's doctrine is that a
// gate counts work rather than time, and the work this file is allowed is
// counted in dropkeys_test.go:
//
//   - A KEY THAT COULD NOT BE PART OF A PATH COSTS NOTHING. Prose whose first
//     token is not path-shaped arms no timer, asks the disk nothing and builds no
//     extra frame. Once a path-shaped first token arrives the fold stays open
//     through later words: until the disk is asked, a raw-space filename and a
//     sentence beginning with a path are the same characters.
//   - A SLASH COMMAND COSTS NOTHING EITHER. `/help`, `/model`, `/export ~/x` —
//     none of them ever reaches the disk, because a dropped path is told from a
//     command by a SEPARATOR INSIDE IT: `/var/folders` has one, `/help` does not.
//     That test is string work on runes already in memory.
//   - A BURST ARMS ONE TIMER, however many characters it holds. The wakeup is
//     the pointer fold's shape exactly (coalesce.go): one is in flight or none
//     is, and the one in flight re-arms itself while characters are still
//     arriving rather than a second one being asked for.
//   - A SETTLED BURST ASKS THE DISK ONCE PER CANDIDATE IN AT MOST FOUR READINGS,
//     and only after the string gate above has passed. A burst that names nothing
//     changes nothing and BUILDS NO FRAME, because it provably mutated nothing
//     [app.View] reads.
//
// AND IT IS SILENT UNLESS IT IS CERTAIN. A burst still arriving spells a great
// many paths that do not exist yet — `/var/f`, `/var/fo` — and the settle may
// land on any of them. So the fold converts only when one complete terminal
// reading names existing REGULAR FILES on this machine, and says nothing at all
// otherwise: a note about a half-typed path would be this surface interrupting
// somebody who is still typing. The refusals a person should see — a folder, a
// file over the ceiling — belong to the door at enter, where the gesture is
// finished.

// dropQuiet is how long a run of characters must go quiet before it is read as
// a finished drop.
//
// It is a QUIET WINDOW rather than a deadline, which is the difference between
// converting the path and converting a prefix of it. A terminal that types a
// drop delivers the whole path in one write, so its characters arrive with
// nothing between them; a multiplexer replaying one paces itself at a few
// milliseconds an event. Either way two frames of silence means the sender has
// stopped, and stopping is the only moment the run is the whole path — settling
// on a fixed deadline instead would convert `/a/b.png` while `/a/b.png.orig`
// was still arriving, and leave `.orig` typed after a chip.
//
// It is two frames rather than one because the surface animates at 30Hz and a
// window shorter than a frame would settle between two characters of the same
// burst on a loaded machine.

// the run began. So a burst that turns out to be an ordinary sentence needs
