// form and what the surface's own laws demand of anything drawn over the
// conversation: the four attribution facts are on it, the pick is marked with
// its reason and what would change its mind, `x` compares only what differs and
// stacks under eighty columns, `c` and `?` write under the part they were
// pressed on, the foot composes `pick · with · notes · scope`, `d` shows the
// pick before it hands over, the settle guard drops the first quarter second of
// keys, `esc` folds without answering, and nothing on the page takes a letter
// out of a box somebody is typing in.
