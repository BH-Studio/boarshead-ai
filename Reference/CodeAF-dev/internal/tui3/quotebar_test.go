// made of — and it sat at the LEFT margin of the feed while that divider ran
// down the RIGHT of the very same rows. On a screen with no other vertical
// rules, two `│` columns meaning unrelated things read as one broken frame. The
// fence beside it already owned the mark for "a block set apart": an eighth of a
// cell, which is a margin and cannot be mistaken for a border.
