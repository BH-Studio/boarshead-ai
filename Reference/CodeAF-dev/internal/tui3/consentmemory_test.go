// THE ALWAYS THAT OUTLIVES THE SESSION.
//
// Pressing [a] has always stopped the asking for the rest of the agent's life
// (internal/session's memo). These tests are about the half that is new: where
// the door wired a write seam, the same press also writes the answer into the
// person's own settings — a tool's allow, or one whole shell command — says so
// in a receipt, and never writes a no.

// remembering wires both save seams onto a surface and records what they were
// handed. It stands in for cmd/codeaf's closures over the profile directory.
