// THE FORMING BLOCK: what a task looks like in the seconds between a
// proposal's yes and the task existing.
//
// A person answers yes on a proposal card, and the task it names does not
// appear in the same instant — the engine admits it, and its first update is
// what puts a row on the roster. The block is what stands at the transcript tail
// meanwhile, so the yes is answered by something moving rather than by nothing:
//
//	▏ task
//	▏ adapter index
//	▏ ⠙ shaping the brief… · 3s
//
// The head is the card's own word for a task not yet named, the second row is
// the card's own name for the work — plain, because nobody typed it — and the
// third is the braille spinner and the count-up every genuinely in-flight row on
// this surface wears. The first update for the task's id takes the block away
// in the same frame the task's own row lands (taskcommand.go's
// [app.settleProposalWait]).
//
// ── SEVERAL AT ONCE ARE ONE BLOCK ──
//
// Two proposals can be forming at the same time, and three blocks of three rows
// stacked at the tail of a transcript is a wall. So more than one is ONE block
// with a head that counts them and one compact row each:
//
//	▏ tasks · 2 forming
//	▏ ⠙ adapter index · 3s
//	▏ ⠙ nil-map crash · 1s
//
// WITH EXACTLY ONE TASK FORMING, NONE OF THAT DRAWS. No head that counts and no
// roster row: that is the emptiness law read at the shape of a block rather than
// at a number — machinery for the plural case does not appear in the singular.
//
// THE PREVIEW AND THE WINDOW ARE GONE, and with them the arrow keys, the press
// and the pointer that chose which preview to draw. They showed the brief as a
// typed `/task`'s shaper wrote it, and that road no longer waits on the shaper
// at all: the task starts at once and the brief is written beside its worker
// (#936). The proposal road never had a stream behind it, so the block is only
// ever a name, a phase and a clock — nothing on it can be opened or walked.

// formingHeadWord is the plural block's head: `tasks · 3 forming`. The singular
// head is [taskFormingName]'s own word and is spelled where it always was.

// formingStateWord is the state the head counts in. It is the card's own word
// ([taskFormingWord] without its ellipsis), because a person reading `forming…`
// on a card and `3 forming` on a block is reading about the same thing. The
// spelling is longer than the word it holds because [formingWord] is already a
// tool row's whole sentence one file over (toolview.go), and one name for two
// things is the drift this codebase spends its comments preventing.
