// PER-TOOL DERIVATION (docs/CHAT-V3.md D11).
//
// Every tool line carries an inline stat and every open tool line carries a
// tool-shaped expansion, and BOTH are derived HERE — in the surface, from the
// Args and Output the event already carries. internal/session does not compute
// them, and must not: "+3 −1" is a sentence about a screen, not a fact about a
// tool call, and a session that shipped presentation would have to ship a
// second one the day this column changes.
//
// The schemas are pi's, from internal/exec/bare/tools.go, and stable:
//
//	read   {path, offset?, limit?}            → the file's text, with an
//	                                            optional "[Showing lines a-b of
//	                                            c…]" footer
//	edit   {path, edits:[{oldText,newText}]}  → "Successfully replaced N
//	                                            block(s) in P."
//	write  {path, content}                    → "Successfully wrote N bytes…"
//	bash   {command, timeout?}                → the output, and on a non-zero
//	                                            exit "\n\nCommand exited with
//	                                            code N"
//	grep   {pattern, path?, glob?, …}         → "path:line: text" rows, or "No
//	                                            matches found"
//	find   {pattern, path?, limit?}           → one path per row, or "No files
