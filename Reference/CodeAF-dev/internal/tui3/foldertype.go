// WHAT KIND OF THING A ROW IS, IN ONE CELL.
//
// The owner's reference (../reference-yazi.png) carries a small mark beside
// every name, and the 2026-09-08 review asks for the same thing here: a compact
// visual navigation aid, so a directory of forty files can be scanned for "the
// picture" or "the source" without reading a single name.
//
// ── THE THREE RULES THIS SET IS BUILT UNDER ─────────────────────────────────
//
//   - ONE CELL, FROM THE BLOCK THIS SURFACE ALREADY DRAWS. Every glyph below is
//     in the U+25A0 geometric-shapes block, which is single-width in every
//     terminal font codeaf has been run in, and three of them (`▸`, `◆`, `▪`)
//     are already on this surface elsewhere. There are NO Nerd Font private-use
//     characters and no emoji: a private-use codepoint is tofu on a font that
//     does not carry it, and an emoji is two cells wide on some terminals and
//     one on others — either way it is a row whose columns no longer line up.
//   - SHAPE FIRST, WITH COLOUR AS A SECOND CUE. A small type mark helps the eye
//     find a picture or source file in a dense directory. Its restrained colour
//     reinforces the shape, while the name and extension remain readable without
//     either. Names stay in reading ink and metadata stays quieter.
//   - AN ASCII FLOOR THAT IS ASCII. A terminal that cannot be trusted with a
//     box-drawing character is given a character it can draw rather than
//     something close (styles.go states this rule for the rail).
//
// The set is deliberately SMALL. Seven kinds is what a person can learn without
// being taught; a mark per language would be a second alphabet on the sheet.
