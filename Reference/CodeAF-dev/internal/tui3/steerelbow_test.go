// tool rows it interrupted, because a correction gathered back up under the
// question is a correction above the top of the screen on any turn worth
// steering. A steer that has not reached the model says so, one that never
// reached it at all leaves the page rather than lying about it, and a fold may
// never hide any of them. And a conversation nobody steered draws exactly as it
// always did.
