// ctrl+g — SEND THE RUNNING COMMAND TO THE BACKGROUND.
//
// Watching `go test ./...` grind through minute three used to leave a person
// two choices, and both of them threw the work away: keep watching until the
// harness's own timeout killed it, or press esc, which killed it sooner. There
// was no third answer, because there was nothing under the surface that could
// take a running process and keep it.
//
// Now there is (internal/session's promote.go), and this file is one keypress on
// top of it. The call becomes a job — same registry, same log file, same row in
// `jobs list`, same exit note into the conversation at the next step boundary —
// and the turn carries on with the tool result the engine handed back. NOTHING
// IS KILLED AND NOTHING IS RESTARTED, which is the whole distinction between
// this key and the one beside it.
//
// ── THE KEY, AND WHY THIS ONE ──
//
// ctrl+b is copy mode and esc is the interrupt, and neither is for sale. ctrl+g
// already closes and restores the task column; while a foreground command can
// be kept, this reading wins, and with none the column keeps the key. It is
// plain BEL so every terminal on every platform delivers it, and it needs no
// Option-as-Meta bargain the way alt+b would. Read it as "go on" — let the
// command keep running and get on with the turn.
//
// ── THE KEY IS ABSENT WHEN IT CANNOT WORK ──
//
// A capability that cannot work is absent, not broken. With no promotable call
// running the key does nothing at all and falls through to the ordinary "does
// this key carry text" — it is not a key that answers "there is nothing to
// background", because a key that only ever refuses is a key that taught
// somebody a gesture and then took it away.
//
// ── WHAT THE ROW SAYS AFTERWARDS ──
//
// One dim fragment in the row's stat slot, `job 3`, which is where consent's
// "allowed"/"denied" already lives: dim, trailing, about the call rather than
// in it. The row keeps being one row. The engine's own sentence — `still running
// as job 3; log at …` — is the tool RESULT, so it is in the expansion where
// every other result is, and the person who wants the path opens the call.
