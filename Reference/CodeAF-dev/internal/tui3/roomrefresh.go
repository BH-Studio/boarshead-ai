// were set by the room's event lane and nothing else ([app.roomEvent]); a room
// on another machine is rebuilt from a bounded journal read instead
// ([app.openFarRoom]) and never hears an event, so ↑ was never known and ↓ fell
// back to the prose on the page — which a journal holds only once a message is
// sealed, so a step that was all tool calls drew no column at all.
//
//   - ↑ is the NEWEST REQUEST as it was sent. It is always inside the tail,
//     because the newest line is the last one written, and it moves once per
//     request — the journal records requests, not the tool results joining
//     between them.
//   - ↓ is the output of every request this page has READ, as the books. The
//     first reading counts what its tail holds, which is a floor where the
//     node's run began above the cut (session.TaskJournalTail); every reading
//     after it adds only the requests that are NEW since the one before
//     ([freshRequests]). A sum over each tail instead would SHRINK whenever an
