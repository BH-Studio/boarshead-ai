// /subharness: THE PROGRAMS THIS CONVERSATION CAN RUN, AND THE ONE CARD THAT
// STARTS ONE.
//
// A subharness is a named program for a narrow kind of work that comes round
// again — "the weekly marketing for company X", "chase a flaky test"
// (docs/SUBHARNESS-PRD.md §1). It takes a typed input and answers a typed
// output, and the thing a person has to do before one runs is settle that
// input. So this file is two surfaces and they are ONE OVERLAY:
//
//	  flake-triage        chase a flaky test · up to 15m · built-in
//	  weekly-update       the Monday note · yours · 2d ago · done
//	  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//	  flake-triage · chase a flaky test · up to 15m · built-in
//	  ▲ test            the failing test's name
//	    branch          main
//	    run it
//
// Five decisions, and four of them are borrowed rather than invented:
//
//   - IT IS THE OVERLAY GRAMMAR (palette.go), exactly as /model and /files are:
//     a short list under the draft, a filter box in the box's own place, ↑↓, esc
//     to leave. Every row goes through [overlayFill], so the ground ladder, the
//     two-line row at [tierPhone] and the pointer's own step arrive by
//     construction rather than by this file remembering them.
//   - THE FILTER IS THE MODEL PICKER'S ([fuzzy.ScoreFields] by way of
//     palette.go's [fuzzyTerms]) over the NAME, THE PURPOSE AND THE CUES. Cues
//     are the words a designer wrote down meaning "this is that kind of work"
//     (exec.Manifest.Cues), so a person who remembers what a subharness is FOR
//     and not what it is called still finds it.
//   - THE CARD IS ONE CARD FOR ALL THREE DOORS. `/subharness` opening it on a
//     row, `/subharness <name>` opening it cold, and CHAT ITSELF offering one
//     (internal/session's EventSubharnessProposal, drawn by
//     [app.proposeSubharness]) are the same shape with the same keys. Two cards
//     for one question is two things to learn and two places for the required
//     fields to be marked differently. The third door adds exactly one row —
//     the answers, because it is the only one of the three that is a QUESTION —
//     and that row is the shared one every question on this surface draws
//     (pickrow.go), with the line under it saying what the answer will do.
//   - THE MISSING REQUIRED FIELDS WEAR `▲`, IN THE QUESTION HUE, and nothing
//     else on the card changes. That is the mark this surface already spends on
//     a person being waited on (homeattention.go, margin.go), and it is
//     deliberately NOT the accent: the accent is the one lit element on a screen
//     (docs/DESIGN-LANGUAGE.md) and a card with three blanks would spend it
//     three times.
//   - RUNNING IS A ROW AND NOT A SECOND KEY. `enter` acts on the row under the
//     cursor everywhere else on this surface; a chord that meant "and now
//     actually do it" would be the one verb on the card nobody could guess. The
//     harness picker's browse row is the same move (harnesspick.go).
//
// AND NOTHING HERE INVENTS A WORD. The PRD names the thing `subharness` and
// this file says `subharness`, `run it`, and the field names the schema itself
// carries. There is no "manifest", no "bundle", no "provenance" on the screen —
// the mark reads `built-in`, `yours` or `from this project`, which is what
// exec.Provenance spells and is why it is spelled in English there.

// subRowsMax is how many LINES the overlay takes at most. It is the model
// picker's twelve, because both lists are read the same way: a name on the left,
// a run of facts on the right, and a filter box under them.
const subRowsMax = 12
