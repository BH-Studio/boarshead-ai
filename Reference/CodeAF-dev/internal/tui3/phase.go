// ── THE PHASE CLOCK: WHAT IS HAPPENING, AND WHAT HAPPENS NEXT ───────────────
//
// The layer that holds the wire knows which of ten slownesses a request is in
// — a handshake, a queue before the first word, a run of thought, an answer
// arriving, a rate-limit wait, a relaxed re-ask, a rescue in flight, a tool
// running, a compaction, a turn being written down for whoever takes it over —
// and it says so (internal/provider's phase.go, forwarded by
// internal/session's phasenews.go). This file is the only place
// that DRAWS one. Before it the surface could see a single bit of any of that,
// whether a delta had arrived in the last ten seconds, so a stalled thinking
// pass read "still working" while the row beside it quoted the LAST answer's
// lane and throughput as though they were happening now.
//
// A DEADLINE IS NEVER INVENTED. The countdown a person reads — "→ parasail at
// 4.4s" — is the watch's own hedge deadline or the pacing wait the router asked
// for: a real moment at which this build really acts. Where no alternative lane
// exists, or the guard is off, or routing is off, the clock still says the phase
// and still counts up, and simply names no consequence. A countdown that expires
// and does nothing is the surface lying about the machinery, and the emptiness
// law already says what to draw in place of a figure nobody measured, which is
// nothing.
//
// ONLY A ROLE A PERSON IS READING OWNS THE CLOCK, and that is a law rather than
// a preference (internal/lane's roles.go). A talk turn makes several calls that
// are nobody's business but the machine's — a title, a memory reflex, a route
// question, a reply check — and each of them posts its own phases. A desk that
// kept whichever answered last would put a naming errand's "writing · 61 t/s"
// under an answer somebody was still waiting for, which is the other half of the
// defect this file exists for. So a phase from a hidden role is dropped HERE, at
// the door, and never reaches a drawing site to be filtered by whoever
// remembered to.
//
// AND A NEWS ITEM BELONGS TO A SUBJECT, AND A WINDOW DRAWS ITS OWN SUBJECT'S
// NEWS. That is the second law, and it is the one this desk was missing.
//
// THE DEFECT IT FIXES, measured: inside a task room the status line showed no
// machine and no tok/s where the conversation showed both, and a stale `running
// ask · 4m 55s` where the node was writing. The desk was keyed BY MODEL — an
// address, not an identity — so two nodes on one model id overwrote each
// other's stage, and [app.livePhase] then dropped every leaf role on the floor
// at draw time because the only row it could be drawing was the conversation's.
// A room could never be asked about itself.
//
// The fix is to take the wrong key away rather than to guess around it. A phase
// is filed under its SUBJECT (internal/provider's [PhaseNews.Subject]) — the
// conversation, or one node of it — and each window asks for the subject it is
// a window onto: the conversation for the transcript, that node for its room.
// A heuristic in its place ("if a room is open, accept a leaf role") would be a
// new lie in the shape of the old one, because two nodes on one model would
// then show each other's rate.

// PhaseNews is one moment of one turn's life. It is [session.PhaseNews] under
// this package's own name, and that type is in turn internal/provider's — ONE
// VOCABULARY the whole way down, because two packages with two spellings of
// "thinking" is two surfaces that disagree the first time one is corrected.
type PhaseNews = session.PhaseNews

// phaseWindow is how long a phase still describes the present.
//
// A POSTING LAYER THAT DIED MUST NOT LEAVE A CLOCK RUNNING, and a layer that is
// STILL ALIVE must not be dropped. Both halves are one bargain, so the number is
// the posting side's own ([provider.PhaseWindow]) rather than a second figure
// kept here: a window this file could tune on its own is a stage that goes dark
// while it is still running, which is exactly what a quarter-hour route judge
// did on the screen before the beats were derived from it.
//
// EVERY LIVE PHASE SAYS ITSELF AGAIN WHILE IT LASTS — a request off its own
// stream, once a second (internal/provider's phaseBeat), and a turn's own stage
// off a timer, every third of this window (internal/session's phaseHeldBeat) —
// so fifteen seconds is a wide margin on either, and past it the segment draws
// nothing and the older readings underneath take over again.
const phaseWindow = provider.PhaseWindow

// newsMsg wakes the loop so a frame is drawn for news that arrived from
// somewhere other than a keystroke — a phase that changed ([PostPhaseNews]) or a
// sighting a finished answer left ([PostLaneNews]). It carries nothing, because
// the news is already on the desk by the time it arrives and a message that
// carried it would be a second copy, arriving after the first. It is ONE
// message for both seams because both ask for the same thing, a frame, and one
// frame answers any number of them (doorbell.go's coalescing).
type newsMsg struct{}

// newsDeskKeys is every name one piece of news is filed under on either of this
// package's two desks — this file's phases and lanes.go's sightings.
//
// IT IS THE SUBJECT WHEN THERE IS ONE. The subject is an identity — one node of
// a conversation — and a node's news is filed under nothing else; the model is
// an address, which is why keying by it let two nodes on one model id overwrite
// each other (see the header).
//
// THE CONVERSATION'S OWN NEWS IS FILED UNDER THE CONVERSATION, AND UNDER ITS
// MODEL BESIDE IT. The conversation is the empty subject by the engine's own
// compatibility bargain ([provider.PhaseNews.Subject]), and it used to be filed
// under its model and nothing else. That was an address again, and the address
// moved while the identity did not: a model picked mid-turn changes this
// window's id at once while the engine finishes the turn on the old one, a
// stream-cut hop answers on another model, and a model changed from another
// window reaches the connection without reaching this window's field. Each
// filed the rate and the machine under a name nobody here was asking for, and
// the owner read it as `via` and tok/s vanishing at random. The conversation's
// id ([provider.PhaseNews.Session], the engine's own [session.Agent.NewsKey]) is
// what every one of those keeps, so it is the first name.
//
// THE MODEL COPY IS THE COMPATIBILITY BARGAIN AND NOT A SECOND OPINION. An older
// peer across a connection sends no conversation at all, and a window that
// cannot name its own conversation yet has nothing to ask the first name with —
// both are served exactly as before this change, off the model. The window asks
// the conversation first and the model second ([app.talkKeys]), so the copy is
// only ever read where the identity could not be.
//
// It is one function because two desks must not key differently: a room that
// found its node's phase and not its node's lane would draw half a truth.
