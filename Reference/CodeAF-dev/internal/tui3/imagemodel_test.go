// `generate_image` is the one hand where the model behind the call is a choice
// a person makes per call, so the row says which one ran and the expansion says
// what it was given. Both facts come off roads the row already draws from — the
// arguments session sends, and the tool's own result line — which is what these
// tests pin: the words, and the nothing that is drawn when nobody knows.

// The finished row names the file and then the image model, and the model is a
// qualifier behind it rather than the substance.
