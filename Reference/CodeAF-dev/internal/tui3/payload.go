// ── THE PAYLOAD RULE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A LINE MAY BE QUIET; THE FACT IT CARRIES MAY NOT BE.
//
// This surface says a great many things on its own account — a note, a hint, a
// legend, an announcement — and every one of them is written in the quiet
// reading tiers, because none of them is the conversation. That is right about
// the LINE and it was wrong about what the line is for. `crew → balanced ·
// brain kimi-k3:low · hands deepseek-v4-flash · checks qwen3.8-27b` was drawn
// at one dim value from end to end: the words a person already knew and the
// four model ids they typed the command to learn, at exactly the same weight.
// The sentence was legible and the ANSWER inside it was not.
//
// So: the prose of an informational line stays where it was, and each
// LOAD-BEARING DATUM inside it steps up one role.
//
//	the prose      dim, or whatever quiet role the surface already used
//	a datum        [palette.data] — a model id, a role's model, a figure, a
//	               count, a name, a key chord. A hue of its own rather than a
//	               rung of the reading ladder, because the first draft of this
//	               rule lifted data to ink and ink is the BODY's colour: a
//	               "lifted" id two rows under a paragraph read as ordinary
//	               text. Lightness is loudness; HUE is identity, and a datum
//	               is a different kind of thing ([hueData] tells the rest)
//	something
//	typeable       the chip a slash command already wears everywhere else on
//	               this surface (slashchip.go)
//	the accent     NEVER. THE ACCENT BUDGET STANDS: one lit element per
//	               screen, and a note that appears and scrolls away is not it
//
// ── THE CHIP IS THE SLASH COMMAND'S MARK AND IS NOT LENT OUT ────────────────
//
// A key chord is typeable too, and the obvious move was to give the chords in
// the legend and the key sheet the same lifted run of cells. They do not get
// it. A chip on this surface has meant exactly one thing since slashchip.go
// landed — "this word is a command this surface runs" — and a second kind of
// thing wearing it is a mark that has to be read twice to learn which one it
// is. A chord steps to the data hue instead, which is the same one-step move
// every other datum makes and costs the budget nothing. So `/help` is chipped
// wherever it is written, `ctrl+b` wears the data hue wherever it is written,
// and neither rule has an exception.
//
// ── STRATEGY OVER DECORATION ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ONE LINE CARRIES ONE OR TWO DATA. If everything in a line is bright then
// nothing in it is, and a surface that lifted every noun would have spent the
// whole mechanism buying back the flat line it started with. So the legend's
// hint lifts the KEY and never the verb beside it; /status lifts the figure and
// never its label; the crew line lifts the three model ids and leaves `crew →`,
// the preset word the person just typed, and the three role words dim, because
// those are the question and the ids are the answer.
//
// ── HOW A LINE SAYS WHERE ITS DATA ARE ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// A datum is named by its own text, in the order it appears: [app.noteFacts]
// takes the words, and [paintPayload] finds them left to right, each search
// beginning where the last match ended. Nothing here guesses at a shape — a
// figure is a datum because the call site said so, and a line whose builder
// says nothing is drawn exactly as it was drawn before this file existed.
//
// The one exception is the LEGEND'S HINT SLOT, which is written in a grammar
// tight enough to read: `chord verb · chord verb`, spelled the same way at
// twenty-five call sites across as many files. [chordSpans] reads that grammar
// rather than making twenty-five of them carry a list, and its rules are stated
// on it.

// factWalk is one pass of the payload rule over the wrapped rows of a single
// informational line: which datum is being looked for next.
//
// It is a cursor rather than a plain index because the rows are painted one at
// a time and the data are in TEXT order across all of them — a fact matched on
// row two must not be matched again on row three, and a fact that never turned
// up must not be found later in a word that merely looks like it.
type factWalk struct {
	words []string
	next  int
}

// take finds the next fact of the walk inside one row, and every fact after it
// that also fits in the same row, left to right.
//
// A FACT THAT IS NOT IN THIS ROW STOPS THE WALK FOR THIS ROW AND NOT FOR THE
// LINE. The rows are one wrapped sentence, so the fact is either further down
// or it was split across a wrap boundary — and the honest answer to the second
// case is the quiet one: the datum stays in the prose tier rather than half of
// it being lifted. Under-lifting reads as an ordinary line; a half-lifted word
// reads as a bug.

// ── THE HINT SLOT'S OWN GRAMMAR ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The legend's right end and the mode lines under it are written in one shape
// at every call site that fills them (render.go's [app.hintWord] lists them
// all): `chord verb`, joined by " · ". `esc interrupt`. `y allow · n deny · a
// always`. `ctrl+r reveal · ctrl+y copy · esc`. THE CHORD IS THE PAYLOAD and
// the verb is the prose, every time, which is a rule worth reading off the
// string rather than making twenty-five call sites carry a list of their own
// keys — a list that would be one refactor away from naming a key the handler
// no longer takes.
//
// A TOKEN IS A CHORD WHEN IT IS ONE OF FOUR THINGS.
//
//	a named key         esc, enter, tab, space, del, backspace
//	a modified key      anything with ctrl+, alt+ or shift+ in front of it
//	an arrow run        ↑ ↓ → ← and any run of them: ↑↓, →←
//	a slash             "/", the door the input line advertises
//
// Those four are lifted wherever they appear, because there is no other reason
// for this surface to write them.
//
// A BARE LETTER OR DIGIT IS THE FIFTH, AND IT IS THE ONE THAT NEEDS A FENCE.
// `a block`, `y yank`, `1 yes`, `1-3 shape` are all keys; `a task will stop` is
// an English article and lifting it would put ink on the wrong word in the one
// warning a person reads in a second and a half. So a bare token counts only at
// the HEAD of its segment, and then:
//
//	a digit    always. At the head of a hint segment a digit is a fact whether
//	           it is a key ("1 yes") or a count ("2 conversations") — both are
//	           the thing the eye is there for
//	a letter   only in a segment of at most three tokens. English's own
//	           one-letter words are articles, and an article never leads a
//	           three-word sentence about what a key does
//
// A trailing comma or full stop is not part of a key, so it is trimmed off the
// span before the lift rather than painted with it: "0 or esc, no" lifts `esc`
// and leaves the comma in the prose where it belongs.

// chordWords are the keys this surface writes out in full. It is a closed list
// on purpose — a hint that named a key by a word not on it would be a hint
// nobody can act on, and the fix for that is the hint, never this table.
