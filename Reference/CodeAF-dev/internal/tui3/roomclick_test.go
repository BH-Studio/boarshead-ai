// A CLICK ON NOTHING IS NOTHING, AND THE ROOM SAYS WHERE YOU ARE.
//
// Two defects off one session, both about a person standing inside a node's
// page. The first: a click anywhere in the body — a blank row, the gap beside a
// paragraph, the slack under a short transcript — threw them back to the
// conversation. Leaving was never meant to be a miss; it is esc, it is ←, and it
// is the pinned header that names both. The second: nothing in the roster beside
// the page said WHICH of those rows they had walked through, so the one list of
// the work was a list of what exists rather than a map of where you are.
//
// These tests hold both ends of that: what is inert now, what is still pressable
// (the header, the rail, the column's own door, the approval row, a parked
// message), and the mark the roster wears while a room is open.
