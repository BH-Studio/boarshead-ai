// A NEWS ITEM BELONGS TO A SUBJECT, AND A WINDOW DRAWS ITS OWN SUBJECT'S NEWS.
//
// THE DEFECT THESE TESTS HOLD SHUT, measured on 2026-09-10. Both news desks
// were keyed by MODEL, which is an address and not an identity, so:
//
//   - two tasks running on one model overwrote each other's clock, and each
//     room drew whichever of them had spoken last;
//   - a node's phase could never be drawn at all, because the conversation's
//     reading dropped every role that was not [lane.RoleTalk] and there was no
//     other reading;
//   - and every rate on the frame was gated on the CONVERSATION's liveness, so
//     a room showed none whenever the conversation that launched the work was
//     idle — which is nearly always, because handing a task out ends the turn.
//
// What a person saw inside a task room, with the node writing: no provider, no
// tok/s, and a stale `running ask · 4m 55s` left over from the conversation.
//
// The fix is a SUBJECT on the news and one key function ([newsDeskKeys]) — never
// a heuristic about rooms being open, which would put two tasks on one model
// back on each other's row under a new name.
