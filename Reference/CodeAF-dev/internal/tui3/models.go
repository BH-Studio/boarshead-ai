// The model list the picker shows, and the one law about where it comes from:
// NOTHING here touches the network.
//
// A person who types /model is asking a question about names they already half
// know, and the answer has to be on screen in the same frame. So the list is
// resolved from what is already known, in this order:
//
//  1. the catalog, when it can answer without a fetch — the door passes it in
//     as [Options.Models] (see cmd/codeaf/chatv3.go);
//  2. this package's own cache, ~/.codeaf/v3/models.json, written whenever a
//     catalog fetch elsewhere succeeded;
//  3. [BuiltinModels], five names this build remembers.
//
// The third rung is what makes the first launch on a cold machine still open a
// picker rather than an empty box, and the second is what makes the launch
// after it show the whole catalog instantly.
//
// [app.modelList] is where that order is actually applied; the pieces live here.

// Model is one row of the picker: a model id, and how much context it takes.
//
// ContextLength is zero when nobody said — an id from [BuiltinModels], a cache
// written before the field existed, a provider that publishes no figure. Zero
// is absence and never a tiny model: the row draws no figure at all, and the
// session keeps whatever window it was configured with (design-law-v2 §16
// EMPTINESS, and the same rule catalog.Model.ContextLength states).

	// cached tokens × (PromptPrice − CacheReadPrice) and cannot be computed from
	// anything the session knows. A session knows tokens; only a catalog knows

// pictures, speech, music, video — and every one of them in this list is a name
// a person has to read past to find the one they meant, or worse, picks and
// then watches the conversation break against.
//
// The rule is text out and nothing but text. The looser reading — "text is
// somewhere in the output list" — is what let the picker fill with image
// models: google/gemini-3.1-flash-image publishes ["image","text"], because it
// captions what it draws. It is a drawing model that also writes, not a model
// you hold a conversation with, and the reading that keeps it is the reading
// that keeps every drawing model on the market.
//
// AND THE RULE HAS A SECOND SIDE, because output alone cannot see the whole
// question: a transcription model answers in text and nothing but text, and
// takes SOUND. It is a chat row by the output law and a dead end in practice —
// the first thing anybody sends it is a sentence it cannot read. So a chat row
// must also take text in ([readsText]), and a slot that wants something else —
// the "looking" row, which wants a model that reads PICTURES — asks its own
// question through the same mechanism ([modelFilter]) rather than through a
// second list.

// ── THE PREDICATE: ONE MECHANISM, ONE QUESTION PER SLOT ─────────────────────

// row asks for one that can see. Those are two questions and there is one
// mechanism for them — a [modelFilter] handed to the picker at the moment it
// opens ([picker.startFor]) — because the alternative is what this surface had
// before: one hard-wired rule inside the list, and every other slot showing the
// whole catalog and hoping.
//
// The filter is chosen from the ROW, in one place ([filterFor] in settings.go),
// so a new slot is a new line there and never a new list here.

// be testable against each other. Since Decision 6 the door hands over the WHOLE

// use and drops exactly the rows they need. A person opening "drawing" was
// offered six hundred models, none of which draws.
//
// So each slot asks its own question, and the questions are the ones
// [config.ModelCandidates] already answers for the rest of the product: image
// out, speech out, music out, video out. The voice slot is the one reading that

// them and which three is not a detail (rowfit.go states how a ranked tail is
// spent).
//
// The order is WHAT A PERSON CHOOSES ON, from the front:
//
//	1  the name          who it is — the primary, and it is never given up
//	2  the lane          WHICH MACHINE will answer: the same model served by
//	                     two providers is two different experiences, and this
//	                     is the one fact on the row that the person's own pin
//	                     changed. It reads `via coreweave` while there is room
//	                     for the lead and `coreweave` after that.
//	3  the first token   will it answer NOW. The wait before the first word is
//	                     the whole felt difference between two models, and it
//	                     is the number this surface measured itself.
//	4  the price out     what it costs — completion first, since that is the
//	                     half a long answer spends. `$0.08/$0.15 per M` →
//	                     `$0.15/M` → `$0.15`.
//	5  the window        how much it can hold. It ranks under price because a
//	                     window is a ceiling somebody meets once a week and a
//	                     price is a figure they pay every turn.
//	6  the throughput    how fast it writes once it has started — a real fact,
//	                     and one that changes a choice far less often than the
//	                     wait before the first word does.
//	7  the arena score   a stranger's opinion, and the first of these a person
//	                     has ever acted on twice.
//	8  what it can do    `sees · draws`, which matters enormously to the few
//	                     rows it is true of and not at all to the rest — so it
//	                     is last, and it is the field a narrow frame drops

// ── WHAT A MODEL TAKES IN AND GIVES BACK ────────────────────────────────────
//
// Since the door stopped narrowing the list (docs/MULTIMODAL.md Decision 6),
// every picker is a filtered view of one catalog, and a filtered list is only
// explicable if the rows say what they were filtered ON. Six hundred names with
// no capability on them is a list where "why is this one here" has no answer on
// screen.
//
// THESE ARE THE CATALOG'S OWN NOUNS AND NOT A VOCABULARY OF OURS. The row used
// to say `sees · hears · watches · draws`, one invented verb per modality, and
// two things were wrong with it. The first is that a verb has to say the side
// as well as the thing — `sees` is "image, on the way in" — so six words had to
// be learned before a row could be read, and the words were the only place the
// side was written down. A table has a head over every column, and a head can
// say the side for the whole list: under `reads` and `makes`, `image` needs no
// verb at all and no learning.
//
// The second is that the verbs were LOSSY where the catalog is not. `speaks`
// was `speech`, `audio` and `music` folded into one word, so a row that answers
// in music and a row that answers in speech read identically — and the two are
// different products. The noun is what was published, so it cannot fold.
//
// THE EMPTINESS LAW DECIDES WHAT IS SAID: `text` is dropped from both sides,
// because a plain text chat model — text in, text out, the overwhelming
// majority of every list — says NOTHING NEW, and `text` on five hundred rows is
// furniture rather than information. A row that published nothing says nothing
// either: silence is text-in/text-out by the one silence law, which is exactly
// the case that earns no words.

// modalityOrderIn and modalityOrderOut are the order the words are said in, and
// they are OURS rather than the catalog's for one reason: the catalog does not
// have one. The live rows publish the same set three ways — `text, image, file`,
// `file, image, text` and `image, text, file` are all in today's catalog for
// models that read the same things — so a column that echoed the published
// order would put the same fact in a different place on three neighbouring rows,
// which is the exact defect the table was built to end.
//
// TEXT IS NOT IN EITHER LIST. Every model on every list here reads and writes
// it — that is what makes them models you can talk to — so the word would be the
// same five cells on five hundred rows, and a column is as wide as its widest
// row. It was tried the other way for one wave and taken back out: what the
// owner wanted from a cell is what the model can do BEYOND the ordinary, and
