// SENDING A CORRECTION IS A CROSSING, AND A CROSSING IS NOT A KEYSTROKE.
//
// Enter in a room used to CALL the engine from inside the update loop
// (room.go's [app.steer], as it was): the surface asked the far machine to take
// the words and sat in [app.Update] until it answered. On this process's own
// engine that is microseconds. Over an ssh pipe to a machine that is busy, or
// paused, or gone, it is up to the ordinary call deadline — TEN SECONDS — and
// for that whole time the terminal draws nothing, esc does not leave the room,
// ctrl+c does not reach the door and the arrows do not move: the one moment a
// person most wants to be able to walk away is the moment the surface stops
// answering the keyboard. That is the defect this file ends.
//
// So the send LEAVES THE EVENT LOOP. Enter draws the person's words at once,
// hands the crossing to a command, and comes straight back to the keyboard; the
// engine's answer arrives later as an ordinary message ([steerSentMsg]) and
// settles the row it belongs to. Nothing else about the act changes — the same
// door, the same receipt, the same sentences.
//
// ── THE FOUR THINGS THE ROW SAYS, AND THREE OF THEM ARE THE ENGINE'S ────────
//
//	sending      the words have left this surface and nothing has answered.
//	             One of the two things this surface says by itself.
//	the receipt  the engine took them, in the ENGINE'S sentence: `delivered`,
//	             `it was waiting on its pieces — your line wakes it`, or one of
//	             the two keepings — `held on the task's record …` — which is the
//	             engine saying nobody has READ them yet and the landing may not
//	             publish over them (internal/session's [session.SteerReceipt]).
//	             RECEIVED AND APPLIED ARE THAT VALUE'S OWN DISTINCTION and this
//	             surface neither adds to it nor collapses it: `delivered` means
//	             a reader has the words, `held on the task's record` means the
//	             record has them and nobody has read them yet.
//	nobody
//	answered     the crossing was asked for and got no answer, twice where the
//	             engine keeps message names. The row KEEPS THE WORDS and stays
//	             offering to ask again; it is not a fade and not a spinner,
//	             because nothing is happening.
//	nothing      once a receipt is old. The words stay; the clause goes
//	             (steerelbow.go's fade).
//
// WHAT THIS SURFACE MAY NEVER DRAW IS A STATE OF ITS OWN INVENTION. "sent" over
// a send nothing has answered would be exactly the lie the receipt exists to
// prevent, one layer further out.
//
// ── AND A SEND HAS A NAME, SO A LOST ANSWER IS NOT A LOST SENTENCE ─────────
//
// The failure that has no good answer without one: the words cross, the engine
// takes them, and the ANSWER is lost — the link died, the deadline ran out. The
// surface then holds a sentence it cannot say arrived and cannot say did not,
// and both moves are wrong. Send it again and the worker is corrected twice;
// drop it and the person's words are gone with a spinner still on the row.
//
// So every send carries an identity ([session.SteerSource]): a scope minted
// once per life of this surface, and a number counting this surface's sends.
// An engine that keeps them answers a repeat with the receipt already on its
// record and delivers nothing ([session.SteerReceipt.Again]), which is what
// makes asking again safe — including after a reconnect, after the engine
// restarted, and after the task the words were for has finished, because the
// identity is written on the node's record beside the direction and read back
// with it (internal/session's task_store.go).
//
// AND AN UNCERTAIN SEND IS KEPT AS A SEND, NEVER DEMOTED TO TEXT. It stays in
// [steerOutbox.unsure] with the identity it already had, so `r` on the question
// it raises is A RETRY OF THAT SEND and not a new one. Handing the words back
// to the box instead would throw the name away, and the next enter would mint a
// new one — which is the double-delivery this whole mechanism exists to stop.
//
// TWO INTENTIONAL SENDS OF ONE SENTENCE ARE TWO SENDS. The identity is the
// EVENT and never the words — "try it again" typed twice means something the
// first one did not — so each press of enter takes the next number and lands as
// its own direction, uncertain sends waiting beside it or not.
//
// AND AN ENGINE THAT DOES NOT KEEP NAMES IS NEVER ASKED TWICE BY THIS SURFACE.
// The capability is asserted before anything is sent
// ([session.Agent.SteerRepeatKnown], answered for the far machine by
// internal/remote's client): where it is absent the automatic second ask does
// not happen at all, and the question the row raises says in as many words that
// asking again may arrive twice. A person choosing that with the sentence in
// front of them is a decision; a surface doing it quietly is a defect.
//
// ── WHO THE SEND BELONGS TO, AND WHY IT IS NOT A NUMBER ────────────────────
//
// A task id is a number inside ONE conversation's graph. A window holds several
// conversations (the keeper), and switching between them replaces the engine
// under the surface while the numbers start again from 1 — so a send queued
// behind another, released after a switch, would once have gone to whatever
// task 7 means over there. Two things make that impossible here:
//
//   - THE ENGINE IS CAPTURED AT THE KEYPRESS ([steerSend.door]) and never
//     resolved again. A queued send crosses to the engine it was addressed to,
//     whatever is on screen when it goes.
//   - EVERY MAP IS KEYED BY OWNER AND TASK ([steerAddress]), never by the task
//     number alone, so a queue, an answer and a kept draft all belong to the
//     conversation they were made in and are found again when it comes back.
//   - AND THE CONVERSATION'S NAME CROSSES WITH THE SEND
//     ([session.SteerSource.Conversation]), because holding the door is not
//     enough over a wire: `/resume` and `/new` swap the conversation behind the
//     SAME remote handle (cmd/codeaf's chatv3_host.go returns the same agent),
//     so a captured pointer would still deliver to the replacement. The engine
//     compares the name against the conversation actually open, under the lock
//     the swap happens beneath, and refuses rather than re-aiming
//     ([session.ErrNotThatConversation]).
//
// ── ONE SEND AT A TIME PER NODE ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Sends to one node go one after another, in the order they were typed. It is
// not a throughput decision — it is the engine's own ordering law: a task
// refuses a message older than one it already holds from the same life
// (internal/session's [taskAssignment.hear]), so two sends racing on one link
// could arrive reversed and the second one typed could refuse the first. The
// queue is per address, so two rooms and two conversations never wait on each
// other.

// nothing has answered. It is a word rather than a bare spinner for
// [steerPendingWord]'s reason.

// ── SURVIVING THE PROCESS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A send nobody answered is exactly the thing a person loses a correction to
// when a window is closed and reopened, so it has to be able to be written down
// — and it has to come back WITH ITS NAME. A restored send that took a fresh
// name would be a new correction to an engine that may already hold the old
// one, which is the double-delivery this whole mechanism exists to prevent.
//
// THIS LANE OWNS THE VALUE AND NOT THE FILE. There is no second store here:
// [outboxSnapshot] is a plain value, and the recipient's own durable state
// (draftkeep.go, the drafts lane) writes it down beside that recipient's unsent
// line and hands it back on the way in. A send and a half-typed line are the
// same fact about the same reader — words that have not landed — and two stores
// would be two answers to it.
//
// THE CONVERSATION IS NOT IN THE SNAPSHOT because the slot it is written into
// already names one, and it is put back only under the conversation it was
// written for (draftkeep.go's own law). It is handed back to this lane with that
// name, and it becomes the send's expected conversation again
// ([session.SteerSource.Conversation]) — so a restored retry is refused by an
// engine that has moved on, exactly as a live one is.

// [outboxSnapshot] AND THE FOUR STATE WORDS LIVE IN recipient.go, which is the
// lane that writes them down. This one owns the value and its transitions and
// never the file.

// steerSnapshots is everything one recipient of one conversation has unsettled,
// oldest send first — the crossing ones as well as the ones nobody answered,
// because a window that goes away mid-crossing leaves an outcome nobody learned
// and that is the same uncertainty.
//
// IT IS ASKED BY CONVERSATION PATH, because that is all a record on disk knows
// (draftkeep.go's slots), and it answers for THIS surface's owner identity only
// — a path that is not the conversation open here names work this window cannot
// speak for, and it gets nothing rather than somebody else's sends.
//
// ── WHERE THE KEEPING HAPPENS ──
//
// Reading a snapshot is not keeping one, and these are the four places one is:
//
//	[app.keepSendFirst]   writes it BEFORE the crossing is handed to the command,
//	                      and the crossing waits for that write to land.
//	[app.settleSend]      drops it when the engine answers.
//	[app.holdSend]        writes the state that has changed, per branch of
//	                      [app.steerFailed].
//	[app.restoreSentDrafts] reads them back when the window opens, and
//	                      [app.adoptUnsentSteer] draws them when the page does.
