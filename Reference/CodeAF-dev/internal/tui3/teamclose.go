// ── CLOSING, REOPENING AND DELETING A TEAM (DESIGN.md section 8.5, c-9) ─────
//
// A team is open or closed. `Close…` asks what to do only when there is
// something to decide: with nothing running it closes at once and offers Undo,
// because a question with one useful answer is friction. With work running the
// card offers three ([app.teamSheetOpen]'s close mode):
//
//   - `Wrap up first` (the default while a manager has work running): the
//     manager is asked, in the team's Traffic, to have everyone finish and
//     commit, answer what it can, and bring the person a closing report. The
//     team closes only when the person picks `Close` on that report, which is
//     an ordinary card in the inbox.
//   - `Close now`: every member's current turn is stopped (the person's own
//     Stop, nothing deleted), the team's tabs close, and the team moves to
//     Closed, in one step, with Undo.
//   - `Cancel`.
//
// A CONVERSATION THAT IS ALSO IN ANOTHER OPEN TEAM IS NEVER CLOSED by this, and
// never stopped, with ONE EXCEPTION: the manager of a team being closed. A
// sub-team's manager is also a member of the team above, so it is still that
// team's and keeps its tab; but the turn it is running is this team's work, so
// it counts as working (the card, and `Wrap up first`, rather than a close at
// once while it runs on) and `Close now` stops that turn. Closing a team
// closes the teams under it
// (internal/teams' [teamstore.File.Close]); reopening reopens exactly what the
// close closed. Delete is only ever offered on a closed team, and forgets the
// grouping, the Traffic and the packets; the conversations stay in history.

// teamsUndoFor is how long a close offers Undo: the wall's own span for an
// Apply, so a person learns one length of time for taking a thing back.
