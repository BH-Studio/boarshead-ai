// ── THE SALIENCE CONTRACT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//	THE LENS MAY LOWER SALIENCE; IT MAY NOT DROP A FACT.
//
// That sentence is the whole of docs/design/lens/DESIGN.md's Decision 4, and
// this file is the whole of its enforcement. A page may fold a fact away, dim
// it, put it a keypress down or draw it somewhere else entirely — what it may
// not do is fail to have it.
//
// The defect it closes is not hypothetical: the task room WAS the copy that
// fell behind. It never learned that a call finished, so no node's row ever said
// "took 4s"; a retry inside a task drew nothing at all, so a person watched a
// dead attempt's half-answer sit above the live one; a notice about a reshaped
// request went on the floor. Every one of those was a fact the chat had and the
// room did not, and every one of them was added to the chat by somebody who did
// not know a second wiring existed.
//
// So the table below walks EVERY event kind the engine can send through both
// pumps and asserts the room's list contains every kind of block the chat's
// does. The enumeration is read back out of internal/session's own source, so a
// kind added there and forgotten here fails this test rather than shipping.
//
// Lane L3 extends the same shape with the journal-role half — a steer mark, a
// note, a divider replayed through both shapers — which is why the case carries
// a name and a reason rather than a bare pair of event kinds.
