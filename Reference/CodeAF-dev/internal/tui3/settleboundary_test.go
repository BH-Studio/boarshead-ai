// THE TURN BOUNDARY, PINNED (#178): what a turn's end owes every block it
// covers, and what a line the SURFACE wrote at that boundary may not do to the
// answer above it.
//
// Two laws are asserted here and they are separate:
//
//  1. SETTLING IS A PROPERTY OF THE BOUNDARY. Both of a turn's endings — the
//     session's own EventTurnDone and the stream closing behind it — settle
//     every assistant block of the turn, idempotently ([app.settleTurn]).
//  2. A NOTE IS NOT WORK. The two lines a turn ends with (what it changed, what
//     it cost) land under the reply they are about, and a classifier that read
//     them as more work demoted the answer itself into narration — which is
//     drawn plain, so a whole answer came back as the markdown characters it was
//     typed as (workfold.go's [workEntry], hierarchy.go).
//
// THE SECOND LAW ONLY EVER BIT WHERE THE WALK IS THE CLASSIFIER — a turn that
// derives a workfold is answered by the fold instead and was never at risk. The
// shape reproduced against a real model is [TestATurnWhoseFoldIsBlockedKeepsItsAnswerRendered]:
// a task proposal in the turn blocks the fold, and the turn's own cached-tokens
// note is then the entry the walk finds. [TestATurnThatDerivesAFoldWasNeverAtRisk]
// pins the other side, so nobody re-derives the wrong story from this file.
//
// Every want is asked of the STRUCTURE and of the RENDERED ROWS, never of a
// guess about what markdown looks like: the defect this file closes was a
// surface deciding formatting from position, and a test that sniffed the text
// would be agreeing with it.

// boundaryAnswer is one reply with the three shapes the report named — a
// heading, a bold lead and a table — so a block that missed the markdown pipe
// says so in three ways at once.
