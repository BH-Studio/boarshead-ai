// THE FRAME NEVER READS THE DISK, AND THIS IS THE LAW THAT SAYS SO.
//
// ARCHITECTURE.md's fourth law is one sentence — "`open` and `tick` may read the
// disk and `body` may not" — and it was true by habit rather than by anything a
// build could check. Habit lost three times, and every one of them cost a
// syscall per visible thing per frame at thirty frames a second: a stat of every
// visible picture taken from inside [app.View] because the stat WAS the cache
// key, the model cache read off disk on every frame of the first-run screen, and
// `/workspace` running two `git` processes on the update loop with a four-
// hundred-millisecond ceiling over them.
//
// So the law is a test. It reads this package with go/ast, walks what the frame
// can reach, and fails on a call that opens a file, runs a process, globs a
// directory or touches the network.
//
// WHAT IT WALKS. The roots are the frame's own doors — [app.View] and everything
// it composes. The edges are four:
//
//   - a call on the SURFACE ITSELF — `a.legend(width)` inside another [app]
//     method — resolved to that method on that receiver type;
//   - a call on the SURFACE HANDED IN AS A PARAMETER — the `a` of
//     `placeFrameWithBar(a *app, …)` — which is the same edge, resolved the same
//     way. It was the biggest hole this law had until #898: the walk made a
//     surface edge out of `x.method()` only where `x` was spelled the same as the
//     enclosing method's own receiver, so the body of `placeFrameWithBar(a, …)`
//     was walked — it is a package function — while every `a.…` call INSIDE it
//     was read as a call on some other value and dropped. The reviewer of #875
//     traced the live one: `app.View → app.placeDraw → placeFrameWithBar(a, …)`
//     ⊘ `a.composerRows → a.composerWhereLine → a.composerWhere →
//     a.composerOpensAt → a.errandPlace → errandHomeDir → os.Getwd`, a call in
//     this file's own forbidden set that this file could not see. [surfaceNames]
//     gives a body's receiver and its `*app` parameters as ONE list, THE TYPE
//     DECIDES which names are on it, and
//     [TestTheLawSeesEveryShapeOfIndirectionItClaims] plants the shape so that
//     deleting the branch turns it red;
//   - a call on no receiver at all — `renderPicture(…)`, `fit(…)` — resolved to
//     the package function of that name;
//   - a func-typed FIELD, through whatever function this package assigns to it.
//     `a.gitProbe = gitHead` is what made `a.gitProbe(dir)` two `git` processes,
//     and without this edge the one call that started this lane would not have
//     been on the graph at all.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT WALK, SAID OUT LOUD, because a law whose reach a reader
// cannot predict is a law that lies by omission:
//
//   - A CLOSURE THE PAINT FILES FOR A PRESS. The frame is walked INTO the
//     literals it builds, because a paint runs what it builds — but a literal
//     that ANSWERS A `tea.Cmd` is not one of them. Nothing in a paint can run a
//     command: [app.View] returns a string, and a row that files `verb{do:
//     func() tea.Cmd{…}}` ([verb], and homephone's `do func(a *app) tea.Cmd`) is
//     handing the LOOP something to run when a key is pressed. Walking those
//     made the frame's graph the whole surface's, and #898's wider reach is what
//     showed it: the former `a.homeCrossChord` asked a running row for its verbs
//     to NAME them on the hint line; the stop verb's closure calls `a.closeHome`,
//     and from there the walk reached navigation, `app.stowDrafts` and a draft
//     record read off the disk — a call no paint has ever made. A fictional call
//     chain is worse than a missing one (the local rule below says the same of
//     names), and the press is not missed by this file: it runs on the loop,
//     where [TestTheUpdateLoopStartsNoProcessOfItsOwn] walks it, and the planted
//     package asserts both halves.
//   - A VARIADIC SURFACE — `func f(as ...*app)`. [appPointer] reads `*app` and
//     not `...*app`, and reading it would buy nothing: a call inside such a body
//     is spelled `as[0].draw()` or on a range variable, and neither is a name
//     the walk could resolve back to the parameter. Nothing in this package is
//     written that way.
//   - A `*app` PARAMETER ON A FUNC LITERAL THE SEAM READER FILED. Such a literal
//     is filed with its body and no signature at all, because there is nothing
//     to know about it but what it does; [surfaceNames] returns early rather
//     than pretend otherwise. A literal walked INLINE is walked with the names
//     the body around it spells the surface by, which is the truth about a
//     closure.
//   - A METHOD ON SOME OTHER VALUE the frame happens to hold — `p.rows()`,
//     `e.word()`, `r.ref()`. Following those by name alone drags in every
//     same-named method in an eleven-thousand-line package and turns this law
//     into a forty-line allowlist that nobody reads, which is worse than no law.
//     The cover is that a value this package hands around — an entry, a picker, a
//     palette, a row — holds no disk of its own: the [app] method that hands it
//     the value is on the graph, and a value method that grew a syscall would
//     have to be handed a path by one of those.
//   - ANOTHER PACKAGE'S BODY. The walk parses THIS directory, so a call into
//     internal/config, internal/home or cmd/codeaf is a leaf. That is how a real
//     per-frame read hid for a while: the door installs [Options.ModelsForService]
//     from cmd/codeaf, whose own last line read the model cache off disk, and
//     nothing here could see it. The seam is followed to the FIELD (below); what
//     is on the other side of it is the other package's law to keep.
//   - A METHOD VALUE PASSED AS AN ARGUMENT — `watch(a.load)` — because only a
//     call's own Fun is read as an edge.
//   - A LOCAL HOLDING A NAMED FUNCTION — `run := startOpener` — for the reason
//     the seam reader gives below: filing locals by bare name lends one body's
//     local to every other body that spells one the same way, and a fictional
//     call chain is worse than a missing one. A local holding a LITERAL is
//     walked, because the literal's body is right there and needs no name.
//   - A COMMAND BUILT IN ONE BODY AND STARTED IN ANOTHER. [commandNames] tracks
//     the binding inside a single function and its closures, so
//     `cmd := exec.Command(…)` here and `cmd.Start()` past a return value is
//     invisible. Nothing in this package is written that way today; a typed walk
//     is what would see it, and this law is deliberately not one.
//   - `go a.method()` is walked as though it were on the loop, while
//     `go func(){ a.method() }()` is not. That is strict rather than loose, so it
//     costs a false positive and never a miss. A PARAMETER SHADOWED INSIDE ITS
//     OWN BODY — `for _, a := range …` written in a `func f(a *app)` — is the
//     same trade: the walk reads `a.x()` as the surface's, which is a false
//     positive and not a hole, and it is the trade the receiver name has always
//     made.
//
// THE ALLOWLIST IS THE INTERESTING PART OF THIS FILE. Every name on it is a
// MEMOISED DOOR: it reads the disk once per file per epoch and the frame reads
// its memo on every frame after, with `open`, the pulse beat or the write that
// changed the bytes refreshing it. Adding a name here is a claim that the read
// happens once and not per frame, and the claim is written down beside the name.
//
// AND A LAW THAT GROWS ITS ALLOWLIST IN THE SAME CHANGE THAT GROWS ITS REACH
// TEACHES NOBODY ANYTHING. #898 widened the walk; the wider walk found two
// things, and both were answered in the code rather than here — the home
// directory an errand opens at is read once at `open` and held
// ([app.errandHome]), and the press closure that made a draft record look like a
// paint's read is not the paint's at all. A name that goes on this map has to be
// keyed at the door whose own contract is the once-per-epoch one, never at the
// leaf it happens to call: [readDraftKeep] is a bare os.ReadFile with six
// callers and only one memo among them, so exempting it would have exempted the
// five and every caller written after.
