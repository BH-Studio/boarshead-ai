// ── THE FOOT'S TWO ROWS SWAP THEIR RIGHT-HAND JOBS ──────────────────────────
//
// Until 2026-09-17 the seam over the box carried the keys that work right now
// on its right, and the row under the box carried the numbers:
//
//	─ porting the parser · glm-5.3-flash:high · ◇ asks ──── space space home · / commands ─
//	 › your sentence
//	 $0.27 · ⟲ saved $0.0038 · 58% cached   66.8k/1.3M · 5%             38 tok/s · ⠹ working · 12s
//
// Home's foot was the other way round — its chords on the seam, its hint on the
// last row — and the two boxes a person moves between most looked like two
// different programs. The owner ruled that THE LOWEST LINE IS FOR KEYS on both,
// and that the telemetry goes up onto the seam where the chords were:
//
//	─ glm-5.3-flash (deepinfra):high · ◇ asks ── $0.27 · 58% cached   66.8k/1.3M · 5%   ⠹ working · 12s ─
//	 › your sentence
//	 alt+e effort · alt+a approvals · alt+k chats · / commands · space space home
//
//	─ glm-5.3-flash:auto · ◇ asks ───────────────── project: ~/codeaf ─
//	 › type to search or start something new
//	 alt+p project · alt+e effort · alt+a approvals · / commands
//
// THE SEAM IS WHAT ANSWERS AND HOW MUCH. Everything on it is a fact about the
// conversation — its model and the machine serving it, its rung, its gate,
// and now its bill, its meter and what it is doing (the name came off it the
// same day: foot.go) — and three of its cells are still doors: the
// model, the rung and the gate on the left (foot.go), the bill and the meter on
// the right (the same two doors they were on the row below, recorded on the
// seam's own row under [legendDoorRow]). The telemetry keeps every law it had:
// the age fade, the money door's warning hue, the narrow ladder ([dropOrder])
// — only the row it is drawn on has changed.
//
// THE LAST ROW IS THE KEYS AND NOTHING ELSE. What used to be the seam's right
// slot — the state's own keys, the chord diagnosis, the earned tip, the four
// idle doors ([app.footHint]) — is the whole of the row now, left-aligned one
// cell in, exactly as a place's foot draws its hint (pages.go's [placeFrame]).
// The home door is pressable there ([app.homeDoorPress]).
//
// TWO FRAMES KEEP THE OLD SHAPE, on purpose. At the PHONE tier the row is a
// two-row deck and the seam has no room for a number (statusdeck.go), so the
// keys stay on the seam and the deck stays at the foot. And on a frame WITH NO
// SEAM — the greeting, or a window too short for the rule ([app.seamShowing])
// — the last row carries the keys on the left and the right edge's aliveness
// on the right, because the state word is the one fact a frame may never lose.

// legendDoorRow is the row a door on the SEAM is recorded under ([statusDoor.row]),
// beside the status row's own indices, so [app.doorAt] can tell the two apart.
