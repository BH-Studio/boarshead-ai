// WHAT A SESSION IS CALLED, AND WHAT IT IS CALLED ON SCREEN.
//
// A session names itself once, from its first exchange, in five to eight lowercase words
// (internal/session's title.go). That is the name in the file and the name this
// surface draws — except when it is not: a session named by something other than
// that namer, or by a model that answered the instruction with a slug, arrives
// here as ONE TOKEN with its words welded together —
//
//	port_b_parser_fix        →  Port B Parser Fix
//	fix-the-nil-map          →  Fix The Nil Map
//	porting the parser       →  porting the parser   (already words; untouched)
//	20260816-150405_a1b2c3   →  20260816-150405_a1b2c3   (an id; untouched)
//
// — and a machine name in the identity cluster is the surface saying its own
// filing system out loud. So a one-token name is read back as words WHERE IT IS
// DRAWN, and nowhere else: the raw string stays in the file, in the resume path
// and in whatever slug some other tool minted it from, because those are
// identifiers and an identifier that is prettied is an identifier that no longer
// matches.
//
// THE GUARD IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. Only a token whose every segment reads as a
// WORD is expanded — a segment of digits, a hex tail, an extension — any of them
// and the name is left exactly as it is. The failure this prevents is the one
// that matters: a session file's own name, which is a timestamp and a random
// tail, turned into "20260816 150405 A1b2c3" and offered to a person as a title.

// sessionName is the conversation's name as the frame draws it: the session's
// own, read back as words when it arrived as one token.

// ── the naming lane ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A CONVERSATION NAMES ITSELF WHILE THE ANSWER IS STILL BEING WRITTEN, and since
// #653 it starts doing so the moment the person's first message is accepted
// rather than when the turn ends (session's title.go). The turn's own stream
// still carries [session.EventTitleChanged] when a turn is running, which is
// where this surface has always read it; the standing lane below carries it for
// the case that change created — a question answered in four seconds, named in
// six, with no turn left to carry the news.
//
// It is [app.watchDesigns]' shape exactly, down to the generation: the channel
// belongs to the agent that handed it over, so a replaced conversation gets a
// new one and events from the old one are dropped by their generation.

// namedAgent is the standing subscription to the name a conversation gives
// itself. It is asserted rather than added to [Agent] for [designAgent]'s
// reason: a scripted agent in this package's tests has never heard of it, and a
// surface driven by one must stay representable.

// listName is what a conversation is called ON A LIST, and it is [humanName]'s
// ladder with its last rung taken out.
//
// THE DEFECT IT FIXES. That ladder ends at the transcript's own file name, and
// under Decision 26 a session folder is named with an id, so the row a person is
// most likely to be standing in — the one they just opened, which nothing has
// named yet — drew `○ 927D303242f9d00e     codeaf here`. At sixty columns
// that hex is a third of the row, and it is a machine's word in the one column
// whose whole job is matching names. It is worse than nothing, too, because
// title-casing it makes it read as a name SOMEBODY CHOSE: a person scanning for
// their own conversation has to learn that the capitalised thing is not one.
//
// WHAT THE ROW ACTUALLY HAS. A [session.SessionRow] carries the title and the
// paths and no transcript text at all — no opening line, nothing the person
// typed — and home may not go and read one, because this list is rebuilt on
// every frame and reading a transcript here is reading a hundred of them sixty
// times a second (tui3.go's seam law). So the person's own words are not
// available to borrow at this layer, and the honest answer is a WORD: the
// emptiness law says an unknown draws nothing, and where a column cannot be
// blank it says so in a sentence rather than in hex.
//
// THE FILE NAME'S RUNG SURVIVES FOR THE ONE CASE IT WAS RIGHT ABOUT: a stem that
// genuinely reads as words — a folder somebody or some other tool named
// `port-the-parser` — is still a better name than a generic one, and
