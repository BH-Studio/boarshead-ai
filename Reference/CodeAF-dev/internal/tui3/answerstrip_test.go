// drawnAnswerStrip is the strip as the FRAME drew it: the row between the box
// and the hint, and the empty string when that row is not a strip at all.
//
// IT HAS TO TELL THE STRIP FROM THE BOX ROW NOW, AND IT DID NOT HAVE TO BEFORE.
// Home's box used to say the former home prompt — `type to search or start something
// new …` — so `› ` at the head of that row could only ever be the strip's own
// lead. The design's box row is the same sentence on every place, home included
// (SCREEN 2b, FIDELITY.md item 3), so home's box now says `› say what you want
// done` and a bare prefix test answers true on a home with nothing to answer.
// The row is therefore told apart by the box's own resting sentence, which is
// the one thing that can stand in that slot and is not a strip
// (pages.go's [app.placeRestWord] draws it, [app.placeStrip] draws this).
