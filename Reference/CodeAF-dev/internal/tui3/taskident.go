// A TASK HAS A NAME, AND THE NAME IS NOT ITS TYPE.
//
// Until this wave a node was drawn as whatever sentence the engine happened to
// put in its Title, at whatever length the model wrote it, with a state glyph
// in front. That is enough for one node and it falls apart at three: the rail
// becomes a column of half-sentences that all begin with the same verb, the
// notes in the transcript say "task" four times, and a person tracking which of
// them is the one they care about has to read every row every time.
//
// So a node gets an IDENTITY, and it is three things, all of them stable for
// the node's whole life:
//
//   - a TITLE of two or three words. Not a summary, not the first line of the
//     brief: a NAME, short enough that the eye takes it as one token rather
//     than reading it. It is cut from the engine's own title because that is
//     the model's own name for the work; the assignment is the fallback, and an
//     id is the floor, because a row that cannot say what it is must still say
//     which it is.
//   - a SUBTITLE of one line — the first sentence of the assignment, capped.
//     It answers "and what is that" once, where there is width for it (the
//     cards), and it is deliberately not on the rail, which is 24 columns wide
//     and is a presence list rather than a page.
//   - a MARKER, one cell, the same for every piece of work. It says "this row is
//     a task" and nothing else, and it is the same mark in the note and on the
//     card that lands eleven minutes later. IT IS NOT ON THE RAIL, and that is
//     the marker's own argument applied to one column: the rail holds nothing
//     but tasks, so there is nothing there for "this row is a task" to tell
//     apart, and the two cells are worth more to the name on a surface
//     twenty-four columns wide (task.go's [app.railLead]).
//
// THE MARKER USED TO BE EIGHT SHAPES IN SIX HUES, hashed off the id — a private
// alphabet in which ◆ teal was task 3 and ▲ amber was task 5. The argument was
// that a person navigates by it. What they actually navigate by is the NAME and
// the state, and the alphabet cost more than it paid: it had to be learned, it
// was learned per session because ids restart, it put arbitrary colour on a
// surface whose whole colour law is that colour means something, and it changed
// nothing about the row that a person could act on. Every row that carries it
// already carries the id in a form a person can say out loud (`#3`) and the
// state in its own mark and its own word — which is what tells two rows apart on
// a terminal with no colour at all.
//
// So: ONE MARKER, DRAWN AS FURNITURE. What varies between rows is what differs
// between the work.

// taskIdent is one node's marker: the cell it is drawn with and that cell's
// stand-in where there is no unicode. It is a type rather than a constant
// because every row that draws one holds one, and because the zero value is a
// real case ([app.taskMark] draws it as the space that keeps the column).

// title reads as part of the title — and `#` is its stand-in, which is also how

// `firstWords(label, taskTitleWords)` — three words, decided here, BEFORE ANY
// WIDTH WAS KNOWN — so a hundred-and-sixty-column room header named the work no
// better than a twenty-four-column rail row did: a family of six pieces that all
// begin with a verb and a plural noun came out as `Cut every list`, `Fold the
// settled`, `Move the tab`, and the room a person opened to find out more told
// them exactly what the column already had. That is [rowfit.go]'s first law
// broken at the earliest possible moment — a fitter cannot give back cells that
// were spent before it was asked — and the answer is the one that file states:
// the identity comes to the row whole and the ROW decides what it can afford
// ([app.roomHeadWord] is the worked example, and every other site that draws a
// name already fits it to its own space).
//
// What is left here is grooming and not cutting: the words are normalised onto
// single spaces so a title with a newline in it cannot break a row, and the
// punctuation that ended the sentence it came out of is dropped.
//
// The id floor matters more than it looks. A node whose title never arrived is

// went wrong early — and "task 7" is a name they can say out loud, ask about,
// and match against the rail. An empty string is not.
