// THE BILL'S OWN WIDTH, AND THE ROW THAT STANDS AROUND IT.
//
// The live status row keeps `$0.00` rather than drawing nothing, and that is the
// emptiness law's one sanctioned exception. It was granted for exactly one
// reason: so the segments on this row do not jump sideways while a person is
// reading them. It held the segment's PRESENCE still and let its WIDTH move —
// one ordinary turn walks the bill through `$0.00` (five cells), `<$0.0001`
// (eight), `$0.0052` (seven) and `$0.01` (five), and every step shoved what
// stood beside it two and three columns.
//
// So the fix is that law carried further and not a second exception: the figure
// is right-aligned in the room its own spellings need. Nothing new is drawn,
// nothing stands in for anything unknown, and `$0.00` is still the only zero.

// cluster was flushed against the frame's right edge and a segment that grew
// pushed everything to its left. Since 2026-09-09 the ledger is laid from the

// ([costCell]), so its own end is what holds still as it grows from `<$0.0001`
// to `$12.34`; and the neighbour's start is what proves the CELL held its width
// rather than the figure merely being padded. A test that watched only one of
// them would pass against the very defect it is named for. It was written that
