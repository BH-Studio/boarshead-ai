// WHAT THE SURFACE DOES WITH A CUT REQUEST.
//
// The engine cuts a model request that has gone quiet or come apart and asks it
// again (internal/provider's streamguard.go). Two things are owed to the person
// on this side of that: the words change from "waiting for" to "trying again",
// and whatever the dead attempt drew comes off the page, because the transcript
// no longer contains a word of it.

// TestARetryChangesTheWordsAndKeepsTheClock is the whole indicator: the model
// name goes (the line that named it was just cut), "trying again" arrives, and
// the seconds keep counting because a person watching a stall wants to know how
// long the second attempt has been out too.
