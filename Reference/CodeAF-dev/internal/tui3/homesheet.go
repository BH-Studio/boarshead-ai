// THE SHEET: A ROW'S CARD, OVER THE WHOLE FRAME.
//
// The card is home's right column and the right column goes at eighty
// ([homeCardMin]). Under sixty there is no second column and there is not
// going to be one — thirty cells beside thirty cells is two truncated columns —
// so the card takes the FRAME instead, opened by the same gesture that would
// have previewed it on a wide one: enter on the row, or a tap.
//

//
// IT IS THE SAME CONTENT AND NOT A SECOND CARD. Every row under the place line
// is a band from the registry (homebands.go), drawn by the same function that
// draws it on a wide frame, at the full width — [bandClauses] already lays a
// band out for whatever width it is given, so a band written once draws on both.
// What this tier changes is three things and only three:
//
//   - THE ORDER. The wide card reads top-down as a description; the sheet is
//     read by somebody standing up, so what they can ACT on comes first —
//     answer, then state, then news, then the work, then what is next, then
//     where it left off, then what it produced. Everything that is
//     bookkeeping — the repository, the keys, the spend — is behind one
//     `▸ more` at the foot ([homeSheetMore]).
//
//   - THE ANSWERS ARE BANDS. The chips a wide card packs onto one row become
//     one full-width row each, in the consent sheet's own shape (consent.go):
//     a digit, a label, and the WHOLE ROW as the target. Three answers across
//     forty-four columns is fourteen cells each before the gaps, and a phone
//     tier reaches down to twenty columns where that is four cells — a target
//     that misses.
//
//   - IT SCROLLS AND IT DROPS. ↑↓ and PgUp/PgDn move the body, and a frame too
//     short for the bands drops them FROM THE BOTTOM, never the title and never
//     the answer band — which is why the answer is drawn second and not seventh
//     ([homeBands] does the dropping, and it keeps what is nearest the title).
//
// AND AN ERRAND IS ONE KIND OF SHEET rather than a shape of its own. `ask here`
// already had a narrow form — the pane takes the frame while it holds the
// keyboard ([app.homeStacked]) — and that IS this sheet with an exchange in it:
// one mechanism, one way out, one bar at the foot.
