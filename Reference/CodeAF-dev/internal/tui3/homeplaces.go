// ── TYPING OFFERS PLACES TOO (SCREEN 1g) ────────────────────────────────────
//
// The tab bar teaches and the keyboard is faster. Somebody who has learned that
// `standing` is a place should be able to type `sta` and go there, out of the
// same box they use to find a conversation — and nobody should have to be told
// the places exist twice.
//
// A PLACE RANKS FIRST WHEN THE WORDS MATCH, which in this column's drop-up means
// nearest the box: the matches are read UPWARD from the box the words were typed
// into ([homeView.buildWorld] states the law), so "first" is the row directly
// above `ask here`. It wears `▸` — the collapsed mark, because a place opens
// into more — and says `a place` in the right margin, so a row that is not a
// conversation never has to be guessed at.
//
// IT IS [homeRank]'s OWN MACHINERY AND NOT A SECOND RANKER. The scoring is the
// same prefix-and-word walk the conversations are scored with; what a place has
// instead of a title is one lowercase word, which is exactly the shape that walk
// is best at.

// homePlace is one of the seven places, offered because what was typed matches
// its name. It is appended outside the [homeRowKind] iota block for the reason
// the three lanes before it were: a constant in the middle of that block is a
// merge conflict with every lane that also added one.
const homePlace homeRowKind = 240

// placeRowWord is the FIRST thing the right margin of an offered place says:
// what kind of thing this row is, so a row that is not a conversation never has
// to be guessed at.
//
// AND THE CLAUSE AFTER IT IS WHAT IS BEHIND THE PLACE — `a place · 6 orders, 1
// fired today`, which is 1g's own row. It is deliberately NOT the tab bar's
// number: that one counts what CHANGED since somebody last looked, and this one
// says what is in there at all, which is the question a person typing the name
// of a room is asking. A place that cannot answer it off a reading home already
// holds says nothing, and the margin is then the kind word alone
// (pages.go's [place.summary]).
const placeRowWord = "a place"

// placeMatches is which places what was typed offers, best first.
//
// THE QUERY IS THE WHOLE WORD OR THE HEAD OF IT, and nothing looser. A place is
// one lowercase word with no title to search inside, so "scattered letters"
// matching — which earns a conversation its place in the list — would offer
// `settings` for the letters of "set the timer" and put a room nobody asked for
// at the top of the results. A prefix is the honest reading of a name.

// best match LAST, so it lands nearest the box.
//
// THE CLAUSE EACH ROW CARRIES IS TAKEN HERE, WHERE THE LINE IS BUILT, and never
// where it is painted. [homeView.buildWorld] runs on home's three-second beat and
// on the keystroke that changed the box; a draw that asked a place what it was
// holding would be a seam read on a frame, which is the one thing no place may
// do (ARCHITECTURE.md's fourth law).
