// ── THE WALL'S READING: WHAT EACH OPEN CONVERSATION IS SAYING ───────────────
//
// This file turns what this process holds into tiles (wallcontract.go names
// the shapes). It has two halves and the line between them is the frame law.
//
// THE READ IS OFF THE LOOP. [session.Agent.Transcript] takes the agent's mutex
// and shapes every message it holds, and over an engine handle it crosses a
// wire. So it is only ever called inside a command ([app.wallReadCmd]), and the
// entries come back as a message the loop folds into the cache
// ([app.wallTakeRead]). A turn holding the lock stalls a goroutine, never a
// keystroke.
//
// THE TILES ARE READ OFF THE CACHE. [app.wallTiles] is called by the frame, so
// it reads the strip's own list, the cache and [app.tabSignalFor], and nothing
// else: no file, no wire, no mutex (framedisk_law_test.go).
//
// WHAT WAKES A READING is what already wakes the surface. A held conversation's
// stir ([behindStirMsg]) asks for its tile, throttled so a streaming answer is
// read four times a second rather than once per token, and a half-second tick
// reads the front and every tile that says it is working, because the
// conversation in front has no watcher to stir for it.
//
// OVER A SHARED ENGINE HANDLE ONLY THE FRONT IS LIVE ([Options.SharedAgent]).
// That handle holds one conversation at a time and the keeper holds nothing,
// so every other tile is the last reading this window took of it: a snapshot,
// drawn as one, never refreshed by pretending to read a conversation the engine
// has already let go of.

// wallStirEvery is the fastest one conversation's tile is read on a stir.
const wallStirEvery = 250 * time.Millisecond

// wallTickEvery is the wall's own clock while it is up.

// wallSparkBytes is how many bytes of growth make one step of the sparkline.
// Forty is about a line of prose, so a steady stream reads mid-height and a
// tool dumping output reads full.

// the read began, so a slow read that lands after a newer one is dropped.
