// ── ONE SPELLING OF THE CHORDS, AND WHAT THIS TERMINAL CAN ACTUALLY SEND ─────
//
// The owner's ask was "ensure you properly have alt or ctrl etc according to
// windows or mac", and the honest half of the answer has to be said first: A
// TUI CANNOT SEE WHETHER OPTION IS META. It sees what the emulator sent. On a
// Mac, `opt+1` reaches this program as escape-then-`1` when the profile says
// "option as meta" and as the single character `¡` when it does not, and there
// is no query that asks which. So this file does three separate things and
// never pretends one of them is another:
//
//  1. SPELLING. What the chord is CALLED on screen. On macOS the modifier's
//     name is `opt+` and everywhere else it is `alt+`, which is a fact about the
//     platform's keycaps and needs no capability at all. [chordSpelling.say] is
//     the one door, and every sentence a person reads about a chord goes
//     through it.
//  2. A SECOND ENCODING, WHERE THE TERMINAL SAYS IT HAS ONE. `ctrl+1` has no
//     legacy encoding — which is why SCREEN 3a chose `alt` in the first place —
//     but a terminal that took the kitty keyboard protocol's disambiguation
//     flag sends exactly the keys that have no legacy encoding as CSI-u, and
//     THAT terminal answers a query and says so ([app.keysDisambiguated]). So
//     the alias is bound off the terminal's own reply and never off a guess.
//  3. THE ONE NOTE, ON macOS, WHEN THE CHARACTER ARRIVES INSTEAD OF THE CHORD.
//     `¡ ™ £ ¢ ∞ § ¶ ≥ © œ ß ∑ ø ∫ ƒ` are what the US layout produces from the
//     chords this surface binds, and a person typing one of them on a place is
//     a person whose Option key is composing accents. One dim line names the
//     setting, and a single real `alt+` chord retires it for the session.
//
// WHY THE CAPABILITY QUESTION IS NOT AN ENVIRONMENT TABLE. tui2's
// [tokens.DetectGlyphSet] may only VETO, because no terminal reports its font;
// here a terminal DOES report whether it disambiguates, Bubble Tea asks on
// every frame, and bargein.go already spends that answer on `ctrl+shift+enter` for
// this exact reason. A veto table over TERM_PROGRAM would be this file guessing
// at a fact it can simply be told, and it would guess wrong in both directions:
// kitty behind an unlisted TERM would lose an alias it can send, and a terminal
// behind a multiplexer that strips CSI-u would be promised one it cannot.
//
// The environment is read for the two things nothing answers back about: which
// emulator is running, and what its option-as-meta setting is called.

// chordSpelling is how ONE terminal spells the chord classes and what it can send.
// The zero value is the `alt+` spelling with no alias and no terminal named,
// which is every surface built without a door — and is exactly right, because
// `alt+` is what the constants already say.
type chordSpelling struct {
	// meta is what `alt+` is called on this platform's keycaps: "" or "alt+"
	// everywhere but macOS, where it is "opt+".
	meta string
	// terminal is the emulator's own name, for the option-as-meta note, and ""
	// where the environment named nothing we can give a setting for.
	terminal string

	// that terminal spells it — a menu path for the two that have menus and a
	// config line for the four that have config files.

// The two spellings, and the one substring every chord constant on this surface

// turns it into the other one at the moment it is drawn.

	// `control` and `⌃`, Option is `option` and `⌥`, Command is `command` and `⌘`

	// this surface was picking differently for different keys: `ctrl+`, the
	// keycap's word abbreviated, beside `⌥`, the keycap's glyph. Nothing
	// predicted which one a reader would get. `opt+` is `ctrl+`'s own move made
	// twice: the keycap word, cut short, joined with `+`.
	//
	// AND IT COSTS NOTHING TO MEASURE, which is what makes it safe to draw in
	// every ladder on the surface: `opt+` is four cells, exactly as `alt+` is, so
	// every line that fits the chord on a Linux box fits it on a Mac. The glyph
	// was one cell by [ansi.StringWidth] and NOT reliably one cell on screen —
	// U+2325 is East-Asian Ambiguous, which a terminal set to draw ambiguous
	// characters wide renders in two, and a font without the codepoint
	// substitutes at a width nobody measured. Every other mark a person sees is
	// reached through `tokens.GlyphSet.Glyph` for that exact reason; this one was

	// dangling operator in it.

	// keyboard it was chosen for — and until this wave that literal was drawn on
	// every platform, so the key sheet on a Linux box named a modifier that

	// half a person READS.
