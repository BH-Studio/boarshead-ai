//
// THE DEFECT, FROM A REAL CARD. A ten-chapter story was written, its branch
// would not merge, somebody took it as done anyway, and the expansion drew ONE
// DIM WALL: the merge refusal, git's own error under it, the sentence recording
// the decision, the words "finished, but needs your look" from before that
// decision, and then the answer itself — still in its markdown source, `**` and
// all — in the same grey as the file count and the price. Five different kinds
// of thing, one hue, in composition order, with the work the person delegated at
// the bottom.
//
// It is one wall because the card read ONE FIELD. The report is the landing's
// own story and it is REWRITTEN by everything that happens to a node afterwards
// — a late verdict, an accept, a merge that would not go all prepend their
// sentence to it — while what the work produced never moves. internal/session
// has kept the two apart since task_result.go, on exactly that reasoning, and
// this card had never read the second one.
//
// So: the account leads, in the hue that says whether the work got home; the
// answer follows in the ink a reply is read in, through the surface's one
// markdown door; the facts sit under it on one row.

//     account to draw. This is every ordinary two-line landing, and it is
//     byte-for-byte what this card drew before the split existed.
//   - It did not: the report LEADS with the sentence saying so (the engine
//     composes it that way, and [taskDone.outcome] is already that first line
//     that says something), so that sentence is the account and the rest of the
//     report is the answer.
//
// Nothing here reads the wording of a report. The question asked is the card's
// own settled state, which is the same rule internal/session's
// carriedResultLocked holds itself to and for the same reason: a report can be
// rewritten hours after the fact, and a state cannot be rewritten quietly.
