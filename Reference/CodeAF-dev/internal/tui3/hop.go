// ── THE SWITCHER — alt+tab for the conversations this process already holds ──
//
// THE ASSUMPTION BEING REMOVED IS THAT THE WAY BETWEEN CONVERSATIONS IS A PAGE.
// The keeper has held up to eight of them alive since the conversations wave
// (keeper.go), and the only gesture between them was `tab`, which goes to ONE —
// the last — and says nothing about the other six. Reaching a third meant
// leaving the chat for home, reading a list and coming back, which is a screen
// transition for a gesture a person fires fifty times a day.
//
// So: a card of the open conversations, over whatever you are looking at, with
// the surface behind it DIMMED rather than covered.
//
// IT IS CALLED `hop` HERE AND `the switcher` TO A PERSON. This package already
// spends the word `switcher` on home's own reading (switcher.go), which is a
// different thing — a whole page, ranked, grouped, with standing orders and a
// ledger in it — and two `switcher`s in one package would be two things nobody
// can tell apart in a stack trace.
//
// ── WHY IT IS BUILT ONLY FROM MEMORY ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// EVERY FIELD ON EVERY ROW COMES FROM THIS PROCESS'S OWN STATE: the keeper's
// map, the sidecar each detach left, and three predicates asked of the agent
// pointers this process is already holding. Nothing here opens a file, scans a
// world, reads a presence heartbeat or crosses a wire.
//
// That is not thrift, it is the feature. Home's reading is correct and costs a
// world scan on a three-second beat; a gesture fired between two sentences must
// cost nothing at all, and over `--host` a reading that touched the disk would
// be a round trip to another machine before the card could be drawn. A switcher
// that took a quarter of a second to appear is a switcher people stop using.
//
// ── AND THE ROWS ARE FROZEN THE MOMENT IT OPENS ─────────────────────────────
//
// A conversation that finishes a turn while the card is up stirs the surface
// (keeper.go's [behindWatch.stir]), and a list that re-ranked on that stir would
// move the row under the cursor between the keystroke that aimed at it and the
// `enter` that took it. So [hopCard.rows] is a snapshot: what is drawn is what
// was true when the card opened, and the only thing that moves is the cursor.
//
// ── THE CARD WEARS THE ONE FRAME, AND THE DEPTH IS WHAT SAYS `LAYER` ────────
//
// This header used to say the card had no border, while the card drew one — a
// dim rounded box of its own, one of three copies of the same six pieces on this
// surface. It is drawn by the one frame now (frame.go, owner ruling 2026-09-11),
// dim, on the card's own raised ground. What says `layer` is still the depth:
// the body behind it is repainted at the FAINTEST stop of the depth ladder
// ([composerFade], depthfade.go) and the card's own rows are left at full ink.
// That is the same move SCREEN 2e's composer layer makes over a place, one
// mechanism rather than two, and the frame only says where the card ends.
//
// The rows themselves are home's rows — the same glyph door, the same bold
// subject, the same dim tail dropped in the same order (switcher.go's
// [switcherLine]) — because a person who has read home once should not have to
// learn a second list.
//
// The switcher is a browsing gesture: highlight first, Enter or a click to open.
// A pause must never dismiss the list while somebody is reading its titles.
// The optional quick-switch setting applies only to the terminal's distinct
// ctrl+tab chord. Modifier releases are not delivered by ordinary terminals,
// so neither gesture guesses that silence means a key was released.

// hopOpenKey is the key that opens the switcher, and it is `alt+k` for four
// reasons stated in the order they were weighed:
//
//  1. IT LEAVES THE LETTER IN THE DRAFT. This key was `ctrl+k` and that is
//     readline's kill-to-the-end-of-the-line, which the composer now does with
//     it (input.go's [editor.killToEnd]) beside the `ctrl+u` it has always had.
//     EVERY `ctrl+<letter>` ON THIS SURFACE IS SPENT — a through z, with only
//     `h`, `i` and `m` left, and each of those three is a byte the terminal
//     already spends on backspace, tab and enter. So a door that wanted a
//     letter back had to leave the modifier the box edits under, and `alt+` is
//     the class the places are already built on (chords.go).
//  2. IT ARRIVES WITH NO PROTOCOL NEGOTIATION. `alt+k` is escape-then-`k`, which
//     every terminal that sends Alt as Meta emits unasked — no kitty keyboard
//     flag, no cooperation from a multiplexer in between. That is the first
//     question asked of any chord on this surface, because a capability that
//     cannot work is absent rather than broken (bargein.go states the law).
//  3. THE REVERSE COMES FREE, AND EVERYWHERE. See [hopBackKey]: `alt+shift+k` is
//     escape-then-`K`, a different byte from escape-then-`k`, so the backwards
//     gesture stops being a thing only a kitty terminal could spell. Under
//     `ctrl+` it was the same byte as the forward one and half the world lost it.
//  4. NOTHING TAKES IT FIRST, OUTSIDE OR IN. No window manager claims it and no
//     common emulator binds it — unlike `ctrl+tab`, which WezTerm and Windows
//     Terminal both spend on their own tabs by default, and unlike `alt+tab`,
//     which the window manager takes on Windows and on most Linux desktops.
//     Inside this surface the `alt+` letters already spent are `b`, `f`, `g`,
//     `i`, `o`, `q`, `s`, `t` and `w`; `k` is free.
//
// AND THE ONE COST, SAID PLAINLY RATHER THAN LEFT TO BE DISCOVERED. On a Mac,
// Option composes accents unless the terminal profile says otherwise, and `opt+k`
// is then the character `˚` rather than a chord — which is the tax every `alt+`
// chord on this surface already pays. chords.go is the whole of the answer: it
// spells the chord `opt+k` on a Mac ([chordSpelling.say]), it watches for `˚`
// arriving where the chord was aimed ([chordDeadKeys]), and it draws one dim
// line naming that terminal's own setting until a real `alt+` chord retires it.
// `ctrl+k` needed none of that, and this is what was traded for the letter.
const hopOpenKey = chordAltWord + "k"

// hopBackKey is the same gesture the other way, and it is `alt+shift+k` on EVERY
// terminal rather than on the few that negotiated for it.
//
// THIS IS THE ONE THING THE MOVE OFF `ctrl+` BOUGHT OUTRIGHT. `ctrl+shift+k` and
// `ctrl+k` are the same byte in an ordinary terminal, so nothing could tell them
// apart until the kitty keyboard protocol's disambiguation flag had been taken
// and the reverse was simply absent everywhere else ([app.ctrlDigits]). The
// escape-prefixed spelling has no such collision: escape-then-`K` is a different
// byte from escape-then-`k`, and ultraviolet's decoder reads the uppercase rune
// back as shift+alt over the lowered letter. So the chord is bound flat, with no
// capability question in front of it.
//
// `shift+tab` REMAINS THE REVERSE THE CARD ITSELF TAKES, on every terminal, as
// CSI Z. It is the one people's hands reach for once the card is up; this chord
// is the one that opens the ring at its far end without the card being up first.
const hopBackKey = chordAltWord + "shift+k"

//
// IT USED TO END THE CONVERSATION, agent and all, with a two-press arm in front
// of it when something was running. That was the wrong act under this spelling.
// A person pressing the tab-close key is putting a row away, not ending an hour
// of work, and a key that quietly did the second while looking like the first is
// exactly the shape the arm existed to apologise for. Ending work is `Stop` on a
// task's own page, and ending the program is `/quit`.

// keyboard protocol's disambiguation flag it arrives as a bare `tab` and means

// ── WHY THE CARD FOLLOWS THE STRIP AND NOT THE RING ─────────────────────────
//
// These are two readings of one set of conversations shown one line apart, and a
// person uses them together: they see `Chats` on the row, press `ctrl+k`, and
// look for the conversation they were just looking at. Ordered by recency the
// card put it somewhere else — the third tab could be the first row — so the two
// lines disagreed about the same five conversations and neither position meant
// anything. Asked for by the owner.
//
// THE STRIP'S ORDER IS FIRST-ENTERED AND IT NEVER MOVES (chattabs.go says why: a
// person reaches for the position, not for the word). Taking that order here
// buys the card the same stability, and it is what makes the digits worth
// drawing — `3` on the card is the third tab on the row.
//
// A CONVERSATION WITH NO TAB KEEPS ITS PLACE AFTER THE ONES THAT HAVE ONE. A tab
// dismissed with `ctrl+w` leaves the conversation held, running and on this card
// (hop.go's [app.hopAway]), and a row the strip never drew has no position to
// borrow — so those sort after the tabbed rows, most recently in front first,
// which is the order this function was handed. The sort is STABLE for exactly
// that reason.
//
// AND IT READS THE STRIP THAT WAS DRAWN, never [app.tabList], which rebuilds the
// row in place and would have the card writing to the thing it is reading. On a
// frame too short to draw the strip at all there is no visible order to follow
// and the rows keep the one they came in with.
