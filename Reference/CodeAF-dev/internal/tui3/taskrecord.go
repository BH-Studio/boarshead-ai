// GOING INSIDE A TASK THAT IS OVER.
//
// A LIVE node has a room: a page that is the node's own transcript, its present
// arriving live, and a box that talks to it (room.go). A row of the project's
// RECORD has no live node behind it — the conversation that ran it closed — so
// the room machinery cannot host it, and for a long time this surface answered
// the gesture with the only other door it had: enter on an `earlier` row wrote
// "@its-name" into the message box and left it there.
//
// THAT WAS THE WRONG ANSWER TO THE GESTURE PEOPLE WERE MAKING. Pressing a row of
// finished work means "show me what this did". The mention is a way of pointing
// the MODEL at the work, which is a different errand and a slower one — a person
// who wanted to read the outcome had to write a sentence around the token and
// send it, and pay a turn to be told something the record already knew.
//
// So a record row opens a CARD: everything the project wrote down about that
// piece of work, and under it the last thing the node itself said, read off the
// journal the row points at. It is a MODE OF THE HISTORY PAGE rather than a
// fourth fullscreen surface, and that is the whole design decision:
//
//   - THE PAGE IS ALREADY THE RECORD'S HOME. It is where every row of the file
//     is drawn, it is already fullscreen, and it already owns the frame, the
//     keyboard and the pointer (taskview.go). A separate surface would be a
//     fourth thing for [app.standDownFullscreen] to keep exclusive and a fourth
//     place for esc to mean something new.
//   - esc IS ONE LAYER AT A TIME, as it is everywhere else here: the card backs
//     out to the list, and the list's own esc closes the page. A person who
//     opened three tasks in a row never loses the list they were reading down.
//   - THE CHORD IS NOT A LAYER. ctrl+. closes the whole page from inside the
//     card, exactly as it closes it from inside a filter.
//
// AND THE MENTION SURVIVES, on `m`, in the card's foot. It could not stay on
// enter and it could not move to a letter on the LIST — every printable key
// there is the filter — so it lives in the one place on this page that is not
// typed into, named on the line under it.

// The words the card says. Each is quoted in the manual exactly as it is
// spelled here.

	// taskCardBackWord is the way out, in the head's right corner. It is `back`
	// and not `close` because that is what the key does from here: the list is

	//
	// THE WAY OUT IS LAST BECAUSE IT IS SPENT LAST. This line is fitted by
	// [hintFit], which keeps its final clause to the last cell there is and
	// drops the clauses in front of it working backwards — so a foot with `esc
	// back` at the head was a foot that gave the way out away FIRST, and a
	// sixty-cell card ended up offering `m puts it in your message` and no way
	// off the page. Every other key sheet on this surface already ends on its
	// esc (`↑↓ pick · enter use it · esc back`, `filter · ↑↓ · enter open · esc
	// cancel`); this one now does too.
	taskCardKeys = "↑↓ scroll · m puts it in your message · " + taskCardBackWord
	// taskCardKeysHeld is the same keys WITHOUT the way out, and it is the sheet
	// the foot draws on almost every frame. The head's right corner already says
	// `esc back` at every width it has a corner to say it in, and a page that
	// named the same instruction twice on a six-line card spent two of its
	// sixteen words repeating itself (docs/design/polish/audit-tasks.md row 15).
	// So THE FOOT CARRIES THE WAY OUT ONLY WHERE THE HEAD DOES NOT, which is
	// [app.taskCardTitleLine]'s own answer and not a second guess at it.
	//
	// AND IT ENDS ON THE SCROLL RATHER THAN ON THE MENTION, which is the one way
	// its clauses are ordered differently from the sheet above. [hintFit] keeps a
	// key row's FINAL clause to the last cell there is and spends the ones in
	// front of it first — that is why the way out is last up there — so the final
	// clause of a sheet that has no way out on it has to be the one both worth
	// keeping and cheap enough to keep. `m puts it in your message` is
	// twenty-five cells; left at the end it would be the clause a narrow foot

	// LANDED ([app.mentionTask]) and nothing has landed here — the row was minted
	// out of the other window's presence file — so `m` would write a name that
	// points at nothing, or, because ids restart with every conversation, at THIS

	// absent, not broken: the key does nothing and the foot does not name it.
