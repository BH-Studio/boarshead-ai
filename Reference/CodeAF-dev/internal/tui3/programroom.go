// programroom.go opens a PROGRAM'S TASK the way every other task opens: as a
// room inside the conversation's own tab.
//
// A task handed to a program codeaf carries (senior-dev) has no worker
// transcript. What the program did is its conversation with codeaf, on the
// task's stored page ([session.PlanTaskPage.Program]), and taskconversation.go
// draws it. That page used to be drawn by the tasks place's machinery OVER the
// conversation — a full frame with no tab strip, reached from the side list,
// the card, a task link, the task strip, the home panel and the sessions place
// — and the strip's hit map under it kept answering presses nobody could see;
// the strip also offered the run a tab of its own that drew itself selected
// beside the conversation's, which a press on the conversation's tab never
// left, and Home opened underneath it and vanished from the strip. The owner
// met all of it on the first senior-dev run of 2026-09-24.
//
// SO IT IS A [taskRoom] NOW, the way an adaptive run's graph is (roomorch.go):
// the conversation's own strip stays over it with the conversation's tab the
// one selected tab, the trail and the rail stay beside it, and `esc`, a press
// on the conversation's tab and a press on Home leave it exactly as they leave
// any room. What fills the body is the program's conversation, the facts row
// is the line the stored page pins under its title, and `x` stops the run
// through the store's own door, as the stored page's `x` does.
//
// THE BOX SENDS ONLY WHILE THE PROGRAM LISTENS. Otherwise the placeholder
// says why, and enter repeats that fact while keeping the sentence in the box,
// where the refusal's door (the conversation) can still take it.

// ── THE HEAD: ONE TITLE, AND THE BRIEF BEHIND A DROPDOWN ─────────────────────
//
// A program's room used to open under two titles: the trail's crumb — the
// conversation's name, which a conversation named after its work spells the
// same as the task — and the task's own bold title under it, and a third in the
// box's `Reading:` label. The owner asked on 2026-09-25 for one: the head is
// the title row alone (the task's name, its badge, the dropdown, the pinned
// facts), and the brief the program was handed is behind the dropdown. The
// way back is `esc`, named on the key line, and the side list's `‹ Back to
// main`.
//
// THE OPEN BRIEF IS THE BODY, NOT THE HEAD. It was drawn between the head's
// rules, pinned and cut to half the frame, and a brief of a few thousand words
// — which is what codeaf hands a program — was mostly a count of lines not
// shown. The owner asked on 2026-09-28 for all of it, scrollable: so it takes
// the body the steps were in, the room's wheel and page keys read it, and the
// steps come back where they were (programbrief.go).

// programBriefChevron is the dropdown on the title row: shut, or open.
