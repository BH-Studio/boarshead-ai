// THE PULSE'S OWN BEAT: THE COUNTS, KEPT WHILE NO HOME IS OPEN.
//
// Home reads the world on its three-second beat and the pulse's two counts come
// off that reading (homemachine.go's [app.readMachine]). A conversation has no
// such beat — nothing inside a chat walks the world — and a conversation is where
// the pulse now says `2 want you · 1 moving` (DESIGN.md's law 11), so without
// this file the counts would be whatever the last home left behind, frozen, for
// as long as a person sat in a chat.
//
// ── THE LAWS ──
//
//   - THE WALK IS A COMMAND, OFF THE LOOP. The world is every project's index on
//     the machine, and a person typing into a chat must never wait for it: the
//     three inputs of the seam are taken on the loop and the walk is taken off it
//     (home.go's [worldSeam], the device hop.go's [app.countConversations]
//     already uses). What comes back is counted on the loop, where the standing
//     bands and the errands live.
//
//   - A DRAW NEVER TAKES IT. The beat writes [app.machine]; the pulse reads it.
//
//   - IT STANDS ASIDE FOR HOME. While home is open its own beat reads a fresher
//     world three times as often, so this one re-arms and does nothing — and a
//     walk that comes back after home opened is dropped rather than laid over
//     home's reading.
