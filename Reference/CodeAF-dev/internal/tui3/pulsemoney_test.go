// THE MONEY ON THE TOP LINE IS THE MONEY IN THE BODY (issue #525).
//
// One frame of the shipped binary drew `$1.85 / $500.00` on the pulse over
// `today $0.13 of $500` in the body of the spend place — two readings of one
// fact, disagreeing where a person can see both at once — and WHICH of the two
// the top line showed depended on the rooms that had been walked through:
// `$1.85` on home, spend, search and settings, `$0.37` on tasks, standing and
// memory. The pulse summed the task records hanging off home's own screen and
// added the standing ledger; the spend place read the usage ledger, which is the
// only reading that sees every call.
//
// So the acceptance is a WALK: every place, in several orders, and the two
// figures are the same number on every one of them.
