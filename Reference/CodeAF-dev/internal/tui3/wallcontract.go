// ── THE WALL AND ITS TEAMS: THE SHAPES THE THREE HALVES AGREE ON ───────────
//
// The wall is a full-frame grid of every conversation this window has a tab
// for, each drawn as a tile holding the live tail of its transcript. A team is
// a named set of those conversations that the tab strip can be narrowed to.
//
// The wall is built in three halves that meet only through the types in this
// file: the reading (walltail.go) turns what this process holds into tiles,
// the painting (wallview.go) turns tiles into rows, and the teams
// (teams.go, teamhue.go) keep the named sets and their colours on disk. The
// wiring (wall.go, wallpop.go) is the only part that touches the app's keys,
// frame and pointer; the strip draws the wall's toggle and the shown team's
// chip itself (chattabs.go).
//
// THE FRAME LAW HOLDS HERE AS EVERYWHERE (framedisk_law_test.go): nothing a
// frame calls opens a file, crosses a wire or takes an agent's mutex. Tails
// are read on a stir or an opening and cached; the painter draws the cache.

// wallLineKind is what one tail line is, which is all that decides its ink.
