// THE CONTROLS SCREEN — the one screen between connecting and the first thing a
// person types.
//
// The setup used to ask three separate questions after the key: a crew chooser,
// then a rails screen with three money rows on it. Five answers, four of which a
// person who has never run the program cannot have an opinion about yet. This is
// the one screen that replaced them, and the rule that decided its contents is
// written in docs/design/onboarding/DESIGN.md: a control belongs here when it is
// NECESSARY TO WORK, MATERIALLY CHANGES THE FIRST EXPERIENCE, and CAN BE
// UNDERSTOOD BEFORE THE PERSON HAS USED codeaf. Two pass — the day's limit
// (money is consequential and an amount can be chosen with no knowledge of the
// engine) and the chat model — and everything else is a setting or a thing to
// be taught at the moment it happens. THE CREW USED TO BE THE THIRD, as a
// choice between three preset words; since 2026-09-24 a task's crew is picked
// per task and asks nothing up front, so it left this screen (/crew is where
// its pins, allowed models and cap live).
//
// SIX LAWS HOLD THIS SCREEN TOGETHER.
//
//   - EVERY VALUE ON IT IS THE RESOLVED ONE. Nothing here is a figure this file
//     knows: the limit and the model are read back through the settings
//     registry and internal/config, so a profile that already has a limit sees
//     THEIR limit and not the default, and an environment variable that owns a
//     row is named rather than quietly overwritten.
//   - THE DEFAULTS ARE ALREADY CHOSEN. Every row opens on the value that is in
//     force, so a person who wants none of this presses enter on `Start a
//     conversation` and has agreed to exactly what they were shown. That is the
//     whole difference between a form and an interrogation.
//   - IT WRITES ONLY WHAT IT WAS GIVEN. Leaving this screen writes the day's
//     limit, because the limit is the field it asked about, and nothing else.
//   - CANCELLING CHOOSES NOTHING. Esc out of the model list leaves the value that
//     was there before it opened. A cursor is not an answer.
//   - THE SCREEN IS THREE SENTENCES LONG. Each control carries one line about
//     what it does and nothing else; the caveats and the exact model ids are
//     behind `?`, on the field a person is standing on. A first
//     screen that has to be read before it can be answered is a first screen most
//     people leave.
//   - IT SPENDS NOTHING. Opening a model list reads the catalog this process
//     already has; nothing on this screen sends a prompt or calls a model.
//
// The example above the form is labelled as an example. It is one request
// somebody could make and the kind of result it leads to. It turns on its own
// clock, every [setupTurnEvery], and the arrow keys turn it by hand; any key
// holds the clock for one more interval, and the focus never moves it, so a
// person reading one is not interrupted and a person filling the form is not
// followed. No invented cost, no fabricated activity, no claim that anything
// has already run.

// setupControl is one row of the controls screen, in the order tab walks them.
// The day's limit comes first because it is the consequential one; the two model
// rows are grouped under it because they are one subject.

// which is the whole of the demonstration: about a second and a third, six
// beats of typing and one per line. It plays when an example arrives — on
// reaching this screen, on ←/→, and on the turn — and then it is still.
//
// THE TURN is the second clock. Left alone, the panel shows the next example
// every [setupTurnEvery], round and round, so a person reading the form sees
// all five without touching anything; ←/→ browse them by hand. ANY KEY HOLDS
// THE CLOCK for a full [setupTurnEvery] from that key, so the panel never
// turns under a person who is typing an amount or walking the rows, and
// browsing by hand is not raced by the clock. Until 2026-10-01 the design
// refused a carousel here and moved the example with the focus instead; new
// people read that as the panel jumping about as they walked the rows, and
// the owner asked for the clock.
//
// AND ANY OTHER KEY SETTLES IT AT ONCE. Typing an amount, narrowing the model
// list, opening a chooser — every one of those jumps the panel straight to its
// finished state rather than freezing it half-drawn, because a half-drawn panel
// beside a field somebody is typing into is a thing that looks broken. This is
// the "pause the moment a person types" rule as a settle, which is the version
// of it that leaves a screen you can read.
//
// THE SCREEN-READER TIER NEVER ANIMATES. Under [app.linear] the panel is built
// finished on the first frame and no tick is ever armed, so what is read aloud
// is one static illustration and not the same three lines announced again as
// each arrives (styles.go's account of the linear tier).
//
// THE FORM IS UNTOUCHED BY ALL OF IT. A beat advances one integer on the flow
// and repaints; it moves no focus, writes nothing, clears no pending amount and
// never takes the caret, which stays in the field on the left the whole time.
