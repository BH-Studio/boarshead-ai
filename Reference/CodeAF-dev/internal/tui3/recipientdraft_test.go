//
// The defect these pin is one gesture long and it was silent: type a message for
// the model, click a task's row, press enter, and the task received the sentence.
// Nothing on the screen was wrong at any point — the box never changed, so the
// words never changed — and the only thing that moved was where enter pointed.
//
// So every test in this file asks one question in a different place: does an
// unsent sentence stay with the reader it was written for.

// draftLab is a window with a conversation, a running node and a draft file, so
// that a test can ask both halves of "whose words are these" — what is in the box
// and what is on disk.
