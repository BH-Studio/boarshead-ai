// THE LIVE LINE'S RATE, AND THE TWO WAYS IT LIED.
//
// The status line is the one row on this surface that keeps a zero — `$0.00`,
// so its segments do not jump sideways while somebody is reading them — and
// that exception is the whole of the licence it has. A rate is not money: a
// zero one is the least informative cell on the frame at the exact moment a
// person is deciding whether to interrupt, and a rate quoted beside the pulse's
// own "nothing has come back yet" is this surface contradicting itself out loud.
// These tests hold both, and they hold them at the seam the two rows share:
// [app.awaitingReply] is one reading of one moment, and the pulse and the rate
// both take it.
