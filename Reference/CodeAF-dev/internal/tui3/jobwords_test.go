// ── ONE WORD FOR ONE JOB, AND NO MARK THAT OPENS NOTHING ────────────────────
//
// The jobs section and the job page are one keypress apart, and for a while
// they said different things about the same process: the column read
// [jobStateWord] and the page rendered `string(job.State)`, the engine's own
// enum, with nothing between it and the screen
// (docs/design/polish/audit-tasks.md rows 11 and 16).
