// ── THE QUESTION BLOCK ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One renderer for every decision this engine hands a person. Before this file
// the surface had one block per lane — the approval gate, the connect offer, the
// harness offer, the task proposal, the standing card, the fuel gate, the stop
// card, the tab-close card — each with its own layout loop, its own key set, its
// own idea of what esc means, and three of them with no drawing at all, so work
// stopped on questions nobody in the product could see. docs/design/questions/
// DESIGN.md is the contract; this is the block half of it.
//
// THE ROWS, EXACTLY AS THEY ARE DRAWN.
//
// The line — a permission, a confirmation, anything whose whole decision fits
// beside its own answers. The row above it is the subject's OWN row, re-used
// rather than re-worded, because two renderings of one call is how a person
// approves something other than what they read:
//
//	  ╰─▶ bash rm -rf build
//	? allow this? [1] allow once · [2] always · [3] deny · [esc] later · 7s
//	  bash pattern "rm -rf *"
//	  2 more
//
// The card — a decision with more than a word behind each answer. Head, then
// the reason and who is asking, then one row per answer with what it costs,
// then the answers row:
//
//	? wants to start a task: rewrite the packer
//	  it will run on its own branch and open a pull request · codeaf
//	    1  start it        on a branch of its own
//	  ▸ 2  not now         nothing runs
//	    3  change it first
//	  [enter] take it · [d] you decide · [esc] later · 9s · [↑↓] choose
//
// The ratify line — the third rung of the ladder, where the work is already
// done and what is being asked is whether it holds. Nothing waits on it:
//
//	✓ renamed 12 files under src/ · [u] undo · [c] change
//
// The receipt, which stays exactly where the question was, dim, because the
// transcript is what happened and "you were asked and said this" is part of it:
//
//	  decided allow this? → allow once · you · 14:02 · c change
//
// And the withdrawn line, once, dim, when the asker took the question back:
//
//	  ⊘ allow this? — no longer needed · the turn moved on without it
//
// ── THE FOUR LAWS THIS FILE IS THE ENFORCEMENT OF ───────────────────────────
//
//   - NEVER MODAL, NEVER SUSPENDS THE KEYBOARD. The box below stays live and
//     typing into it is answering in words. This RETIRES the consent block's
//     "IT SUSPENDS THE KEYBOARD" law, which was the honest design when esc's
//     only two readings were "answer no" and "be trapped": a block a person
//     could not leave had to own every key so that nothing was typed into a
//     conversation that could not move. esc is `later` now, so there is a way
//     out that neither answers nor traps, and the keyboard goes back to the
//     person ([app.questionKey] takes only what it draws).
//   - THE SETTLE GUARD. A key that arrived before the question had been on
//     screen for [questionSettle] is DROPPED, never applied. A question that
//     lands under a hand already moving is a question answered by a keystroke
//     aimed at the sentence somebody was typing.
//   - THE BOX IS NEVER MOVED UNDER A HAND. A question raised while the box
//     holds words waits behind the chip until the words go or the hands stop
//     for [questionQuiet] ([app.questionQuieted]).
//   - THE ANSWER IS THE RECORD. Every answer leaves its line where the question
//     was, and the line is [session.DecisionRecord.Line]'s — the engine's own
//     rendering, so the row a person reads and the line the model reads cannot
//     become two accounts of one decision.

const (
	// questionSettle is how long a question must have been ON SCREEN before it
	// will take a key. 250ms is the settle guard's own number from
	// docs/design/questions/DESIGN.md, and it is about the hand rather than the
	// eye: it is roughly one keystroke at a fast typing speed, which is exactly
	// the window in which a question can arrive between a person deciding to
	// press a key and the key landing.
	questionSettle = 250 * time.Millisecond
	// questionQuiet is how long the box must have been still before a question
	// that arrived on top of a half-typed sentence is allowed to take its rows.
	// Three seconds is a pause somebody has stopped typing in rather than a gap
	// between two words.
	questionQuiet = 3 * time.Second
	// questionRuleAfter is how many same-shaped yeses are given before `r make
	// it a rule` is offered. The third, because two is a coincidence and a rule
	// offered on the first is the surface guessing at a habit somebody has not
	// formed (DESIGN.md's RULES ARE OFFERED, VISIBLE, FORGETTABLE).

// has one.
//
// IT IS AN OPTIONAL ASSERTION AND NOT A LINE ON [Agent], for stop.go's reason
// exactly: an agent that has never heard of questions keeps everything else it
// had, and this surface simply draws no engine questions rather than failing to
// compile against every fake in the tree. A CAPABILITY THAT CANNOT WORK IS

// drawn smaller, it is a question that never reaches a screen at all. That is
