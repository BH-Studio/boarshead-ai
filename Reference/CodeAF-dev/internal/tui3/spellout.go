// SPELL IT OUT — the gap between what somebody meant and what they typed,
// closed at the box instead of at the answer.
//
// "build me a login page" is a finished sentence and an unfinished request.
// Everybody who types it wants the same dozen things and writes down none of
// them, so the model guesses, and which guesses were wrong is discovered by
// reading a whole answer. This is the offer to see it first: a dim line in the
// hint slot while the draft is making-shaped and short, one cheap call on the
// chord, and a block under the box saying what the sentence obviously means
// (internal/session's spellout.go writes it).
//
// ── THE FOUR LAWS OF THIS GESTURE ──
//
//   - IT NEVER FIRES ON ITS OWN. There is no safe trigger for spending a
//     person's money on a sentence they have not finished typing, so the only
//     thing that makes the call is [spellOutKey] under their own finger. The
//     hint is a courtesy that teaches the chord exists and nothing else.
//
//   - IT NEVER SENDS. `enter` on the block APPENDS it to the draft, and what
//     lands in the box is plain text with nothing special about it afterwards —
//     the person edits it, deletes half of it, or sends it, exactly as if they
//     had typed it. `esc` leaves no trace at all.
//
//   - A STALE EXPANSION IS NEVER ADDED TO A CHANGED SENTENCE. The block is shown
//     only while the draft is byte-identical to the draft it was made about
//     ([app.spellShowing]), so any key that edits the box dismisses it — not by a
//     hook that has to be remembered at twenty-two call sites, but because the
//     condition that draws it has stopped being true.
//
//   - THE EMPTINESS LAW, READ THE OTHER WAY. A draft that already spells out
//     what it wants gets no hint, and that is the point of the feature rather
//     than a limit on it: an offer to add detail to a detailed request is noise
//     under every draft on the surface, and a hint people learn to ignore is
//     worse than one they never saw.

// spellOutKey is the chord, and it is named ONCE: the hint under the box, the
// key router and the manual's own sentence are all this constant or a quotation
// of it.
//
// WHY THIS ONE. ctrl+g — the obvious reading of "go on and say more" — is spent
// twice over on this surface already: a running foreground command gets it
// first (background.go), and with none to keep it closes or restores the task
// column (task.go's railStowKey). Of what is left, ctrl+s
// and ctrl+q are flow control on a serial terminal, ctrl+d is end-of-file,
// ctrl+z is suspend and ctrl+h is what some terminals send for backspace — five
// chords whose failure mode is doing something the person cannot undo. ctrl+r is
// none of those: it is a plain control byte every terminal delivers, and the
// only place tui3 binds it is a task room's landed-files list (deliverables.go's
// filesRevealKey), which is a different page with a different keyboard. In the
// message box it has never meant anything.
//
// AND IT ACTS EXACTLY WHERE IT IS ADVERTISED. Pressed while the hint is not up,
// it does nothing at all — the same absence law ctrl+g keeps with no command
// running ([app.spellKey]).
const spellOutKey = "ctrl+r"

// The three sentences this gesture says. Two of them carry the whole of its
// vocabulary — `spell it out`, and internal/session's `taking it to mean —` —
// and nothing else here is a word a person has to learn.
var (
	// spellOutHint is the hint slot's line while the draft is making-shaped with
	// room to grow. It is the chord and what the chord does, in the slot's own
	// grammar (render.go's [app.hintWord]).
	spellOutHint = spellOutKey + " spell it out"
	// spellOutVerbs is the block's own last row: the two keys it answers, in the
	// order a person meets them. `enter` says where the text goes rather than
	// what happens to the block, because WHERE IT GOES is the fact somebody has

// runes.
//
// IT IS THE EMPTINESS LAW IN A NUMBER. Past this the person has spelled it out
// themselves, and an offer to do it for them is the surface reading their

//
// SO FALSE NEGATIVES ARE FREE AND THE LIST STAYS SHORT — standmark.go's rule
// about the same slot, for the same reason: a wider list would put a dim line
// under half the drafts on this surface. They are matched at a word boundary by
// [standMarkAt], which is this surface's one reading of "this phrase, at the
// start of a word", and spelled without a trailing space on purpose so that
// build, builds and building are all one entry. `add ` is the one exception and
