// ── ASKING THE ROUTER FOR TODAY'S LIST, FROM INSIDE /model ─────────────────
//
// The picker's list is resolved before it opens and never fetched on its own
// (models.go), and the catalog behind it is a day old at worst — so a model a
// provider shipped this morning is not in /model until tomorrow. This is the
// one way round that: a key, on the open list, that asks the door for the
// newest list while the list stays usable.
//
// Four properties are the whole design:
//
//   - IT IS ASKED FOR, NEVER TAKEN. Nothing here runs on a clock or on open; the
//     picker still opens in the same frame with what is already known.
//   - THE LIST IS NEVER TAKEN AWAY. A failure keeps the rows exactly as they
//     were, and a success only adds: a model that vanished is not mentioned.
//   - THE PICKER KEEPS ANSWERING. The fetch is a command off the loop; every key
//     still walks, filters and switches while it is out.
//   - A DOOR THAT CANNOT REFRESH HAS NO KEY. With [Options.RefreshModels] nil
//     the chord does nothing and no line on the surface names it — the absence
//     law, which is why every word below is spoken through [picker.offersRefresh].

// refreshModelsKey is the chord, and it is named ONCE: the placeholder, the
// matches line, the key router and the manual's sentence are all this constant.
//
// WHY ctrl+r. It reads as reload, and it is free here: its two other meanings on
// this surface — spell it out over a draft (spellout.go) and reveal a file in
// /files (deliverables.go) — can never fire while the picker is up, because the
// picker owns the keyboard before either of them is read (input.go).
const refreshModelsKey = "ctrl+r"

// The words this gesture says, each once.
const (
	// refreshModelsHint is the placeholder's field for the key.
	refreshModelsHint = refreshModelsKey + " refresh"
	// noModelMatches is the list's one line when the filter matched nothing, and
	// noModelMatchesFetch is that line on a list that can be refreshed: the
	// moment a person cannot find a model is the moment they want the newest
	// list.
	noModelMatches      = "no model matches"
	noModelMatchesFetch = noModelMatches + " · " + refreshModelsKey + " fetches the newest list"
	// modelsFetching stands at the head of the list while the fetch is out. It
	// is ONE PLACE and it is the list's rather than the placeholder's, because
	// the placeholder is gone the moment anything is typed and the list line is
	// there whatever the filter says.

	// in the picker's voice: `models · 612 · 9 new · a, b, c`.
