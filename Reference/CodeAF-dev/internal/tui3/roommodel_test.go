// ── THE STATUS LINE'S MODEL, WHILE A ROOM IS OPEN ───────────────────────────
//
// The bug these tests hold shut: a conversation on one model, a task launched
// on another, the task genuinely running on the one it was given — and the only
// always-visible model name on the screen still saying the CONVERSATION's, from
// inside the task's own room. A person read it and concluded their task had run
// on the default.
//
// The law is render.go's own, applied rather than excepted: the status row is
// about THE WINDOW, and while a room is open the window IS that task.

// roomModelApp is a room open on a node that was launched with this model, on a
// session running something else — the exact shape of the night's bug. An empty
// model is the other half of it: a node nobody published one for.
//
// The model rides the node's FIRST update, which is where the engine settles it
// (task.go: the contract is frozen at admission, and a second update carrying
// nothing new is thrown out as the duplicate it is).
