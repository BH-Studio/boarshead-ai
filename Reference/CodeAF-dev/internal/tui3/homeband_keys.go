// drawKeysBand is the quiet legend at the foot of every actionable card.
//
// A LEGEND ONLY EVER NAMES KEYS THAT WORK. A conversation whose project folder
// has been deleted keeps `ctrl+y` and `→` — copying a path is a string and
// folding a band is what is already on screen, and neither asks the disk for
// anything — and loses `enter`, `ctrl+t` and `ctrl+o`, which all want that
// folder: `enter` opens a conversation rooted in it, `ctrl+t` starts one
// there, `ctrl+o` hands it to the machine's file manager. All three refuse,
// and a card that advertised them would be spending its last line inviting
// three keystrokes it has already decided against. So the sentence takes their
// place, which is also the answer to "why are there only two keys here".
//
// AND EVERY KEY HERE IS A CHORD OR AN ARROW, never a bare letter: home's box
// takes every letter, always (home.go's [app.homeKey]), so a legend that named
// one would be advertising a keystroke the box is about to eat.
