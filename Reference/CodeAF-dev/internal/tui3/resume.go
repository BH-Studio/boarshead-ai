// THE RESUME PICKER: /resume, and the surface `codeaf resume` opens on.
//
// The welcome box already lists the last four conversations (welcome.go), and
// it is the right answer to "where was I" for the ten seconds after a launch:
// it is on screen, it costs no keystroke, and then it is gone for good. What it
// is not is a way BACK. A person three days and six sessions later wants the
// one about the migration, not the fourth-most-recent one, and the box has no
// row for it and no way to be asked.
//
// So this is the same list, opened on purpose and asked a question:
//
//   - IT IS THE PICKER GESTURE, unchanged. A filter box in the input line's
//     place, a short list under it, ↑↓ to move, enter to open, esc to leave
//     everything as it was — the same overlay grammar /model uses (palette.go),
//     because a second list that behaved differently would be a second thing to
//     learn for a question that is the same question.
//   - A ROW IS A NAME, A DESCRIPTION AND AN AGE, in that order of loudness. The
//     name is what the session called itself, made readable ([humanName]); the
//     description is the last thing that happened in it; the age is dim and
//     coarse. Ids and file names appear nowhere: a person remembers "the resume
//     picker one, yesterday", and no part of 20260816-150405_a3f2.jsonl is that.
//   - IT NEVER OPENS ON NOTHING. A directory with no conversations in it gets a
//     sentence saying so and no overlay — a modal list with no rows is a trap
//     that has to be dismissed before it can be told it was useless.
