// WHETHER A PATH IS A LINK IS A FACT ABOUT THE PATH, NOT ABOUT THE WINDOW.
//
// The chain that puts a wrapped path back together was bounded by how many ROWS
// it spanned, and how many rows a path takes is a fact about the FRAME: the same
// name is three rows at 160 columns and ten at 28. So the bound was loosest
// exactly where paths are shortest, and tightest exactly where the narrow frame
// this pass exists for needed it most — a generated file a few directories deep
// was a link at 55 columns and not at 28, which is the opposite of the point.
//
// The assertion is the invariant rather than the mechanism: ONE path, EVERY
// width, always a link. A bound measured in rows cannot pass it at every width
// no matter what number is chosen, because there is always a narrower frame.

	// left the path inside eight rows even at 24 columns — the same accident
	// that let the defect live. The name is built to exceed the old bound's
