// Every test below asserts the fact the surface exists for — what is on the
// screen, what it deliberately does NOT draw, and what reaches the engine when
// a key is pressed — rather than the shape of the code under it
// (subharness.go).

// subFake is a session that can be asked about subharnesses: the optional half
// of the seam ([subharnessAgent]), which the ordinary scripted agent has never
// heard of.
//
// IT ANSWERS THE WAY THE REAL DOORS DO. The intake it hands back is built out of
// the manifest's own schema exactly as internal/session's SubharnessIntake
// builds one — every field blank, every required one missing — so a card that
// only worked against a hand-written fixture could not pass here. What it adds
// is `filled`, which is the session lane's half arriving early: a card chat has
// already read the conversation into.
