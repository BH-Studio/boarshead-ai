// ── THE TWO COLUMNS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// These tests are about the ARRANGEMENT and nothing else: which shape a width
// asks for, what stands in each column, where the cursor opens, and the one cell
// on the whole page that is allowed to turn. What the columns HOLD is tested
// where it is built — switcher_test.go's reading, place_home_test.go's wiring,
// homeband_machine_test.go's card.
//
// THE LADDER USED TO HAVE THREE RUNGS AND HAS TWO. The zones' column and the
// everyday card tier went with the strips, so every test here that asked "which
// of three shapes is this width" now asks "is the width genuinely spare", and
// every test that asked "which column did that row leave the list for" now asks
// "does the list keep the whole frame".

// bridgeLab is a machine with something in every column: two projects, a
// conversation stopped on a question somewhere else, work running here, and a
// standing order for the machine's own card — on a frame past [homeCardMin], so
// there is a second column to have opinions about.
