// ── SORTING A TABLE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The list is a TABLE, and the question in front of somebody reading one is
// almost never "what does this row say" — it is "which row is the cheapest",
// "which holds the most", "which answers fastest". A column makes those
// comparable by eye over a screenful. Over six hundred rows the eye is not
// enough, and ordering by the column is the only thing that is.
//
// This is also where the filter box's two ordering words went. `fast` and `cheap`
// sorted the list and were removed with the rest of that query language
// ([picker.rank] argues why), and the objection to them was never that sorting is
// the wrong idea — it was that a word typed into a name box is an undiscoverable
// way to ask for it, and that two words are two opinions about seven columns. A
// key that walks the columns you can see is the discoverable form of the same
// request, and it reaches every one of them.
//
// IT IS ONE ENGINE FOR BOTH TABLES, which is [colTable]'s own rule said about
// order instead of about width: the model list and the providers inside a fold are
// two column sets drawn by one thing, so they are two column sets ORDERED by one
// thing. Which column can be sorted, and which way it is read first, are written
// on the column itself ([tableColumn.sorts] and `up`) rather than in a second list
// here that would have to be kept in step with the first.

// The picker owns its sorting chords independently of the Sessions page.

// sorted, so nothing has to remember to initialise this.

// ([tableColumn.up]) — is always the first of the pair, because that is the
