// ── THE DOCK: EVERY OPEN CONVERSATION, UNDER THE BOX ────────────────────────
//
// The wall's door used to be a `⊞` at the right end of the tab strip, which is
// the far end of the frame from where a person's hands are. The owner asked for
// it to come down to where people type, so the row under the box ends in a
// small map of every conversation this window has open:
//
//	› say what you want done
//	  alt+k chats · / commands                              ▦ All ▪▪▣▪
//
// `▦ All` is the wall's door, spelled exactly as the strip's own door to it is
// spelled (chattabs.go's [tabWallWord]), and it is ONE BUTTON: the glyph and the
// word are one target, and the pointer's ground covers both. Each cell after it
// is one conversation, in the strip's own order ([app.tabList]), painted by what
// it is doing: the live hue while it works, the warning hue while it waits on a
// person, dim at rest. The one in front is `▣` in ink. A press on a cell goes
// to that conversation by the strip's own door ([app.tabGo]), so a cell can
// never do something its tab would not.
//
// ONE WORD, ONE DOOR, EVERYWHERE. The word here used to be `chats`, and the
// nav's `chats` sits over the same frame and goes somewhere else: back to the
// conversation in front (place_chats.go). Two presses on one word that land in
// two places is a word a person cannot learn, so this door says what it opens,
// in the words the strip already uses for it.
//
// IT READS MEMORY AND NOTHING ELSE. The cells are the strip's list and the
// strip's signals ([app.tabSignalFor]), both of which are the keeper's cached
// facts, because this row is drawn on every frame and the frame may not touch
// the disk (framedisk_law_test.go).
//
// IT IS DRAWN ONLY WHERE IT HAS SOMETHING TO SAY. One conversation is not a
// map, so the dock waits for a second (the emptiness law). It is drawn only on
// the row the keys are drawn on, so never on the wall itself, never on the
// phone's deck, and never on the new-chat frame, which has no keys row.
//
// AND IT TAKES ONLY WHAT THE KEYS LEFT. The keys are how a person drives this
// frame from the keyboard, and the aliveness on a frame with no seam is the
// one fact a frame may never lose (footswap.go), so both are laid out first
// and the dock is fitted into what remains: the word `All` first, then
// fewer cells and a `+N` count, and then no dock at all. The telemetry is on
// the seam, a row the dock never draws on, so no number is ever given up for it.

// dockCap is how many conversations the dock spells before it counts the rest.
const dockCap = 12

// dockFloor is the fewest cells a narrowed dock will draw. Below it the dock is
// dropped whole: one cell and a count is not a map of anything.

// same door ([tabWallWord]). It is ASCII, so its length is its width.

// strip's own door to the wall (`▦ All`), and the dock's `▦ All` says
// [dockChatsWord], which is the same sentence: they are the same door.
//
// IT SAYS GRID AND TABS, NOT "EVERY CONVERSATION", because the nav's `chats`
// sits right over it on every page and is the place for every conversation
// (topnav.go). Two doors a row apart that both said "every conversation"
// would be one door drawn twice; this one is the tabs open here, side by side.
