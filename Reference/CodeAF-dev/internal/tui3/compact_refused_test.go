// A PASS THAT COMPACTED NOTHING MUST NOT MOVE ANYBODY'S PLACE IN THE HISTORY.
//
// [session.EventCompacted] is sent whether the pass edited the transcript or
// found nothing to do, because a surface opens a row on EventCompacting and has
// to be able to settle it either way. [app.rebase] read every one of them as a
// replacement and handed the scrollback over to it: replayFrom was dropped to a
// floor the reader was nowhere near, so the conversation between the two was
// declared already drawn, and earlierSeam was marked true without the seam ever
// being drawn. The surface then said there was nothing above the screen.
//
// Nothing had moved, so there is nothing to carry over.
