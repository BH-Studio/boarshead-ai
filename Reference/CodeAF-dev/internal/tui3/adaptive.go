// ── THE MEASURED GROUND ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// styles.go authors two ladders against an ASSUMED background, because for four
// waves there was no way to learn the real one: a constructor may not block on a
// round trip that a terminal is free never to answer. This file is the other
// half of that sentence. The round trip is still a round trip — but it is an
// EVENT now, asked for in [app.Init] and answered, if it is answered at all, on
// the same message lane every keystroke arrives on. Nothing waits for it, so the
// law the constructor keeps is untouched.
//
// What arrives is one colour: the terminal's own background. Everything in this
// file is what that one colour buys, and it is all arithmetic — pure functions
// from a measured ground to a ladder, with a single thin hook at the bottom that
// swaps the app's palette and drops the paint that was cached against the old
// one.
//
// THE PALETTE IS STILL CLOSED. This file computes colours; it does not AUTHOR
// any. There is not one hex literal below, and there cannot be: every value here
// is derived from a hue styles.go already owns or from the ground the terminal
// reported. The two files together are still the only pair in the package that
// may hold an escape sequence, and only styles.go writes one.

// measuredGround is the terminal's own background, as the terminal reported it.
//
// It is a type of its own rather than three loose bytes because it is the one
// fact everything in this file is a function of, and a signature that says
// "measuredGround" cannot be handed an ink by accident — which, in a package
// whose whole vocabulary is colours, is a mistake worth making impossible.

// ── WHAT THE GROUND STEPS AIM AT ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// These are not new numbers. They are the numbers styles.go's GROUND LADDER
// already states as its aim, read off the middle of the range it had to assume —
// the cursor step just above the point a flat tint stops being perceptible, the
// selected step half a step louder, and the marked span louder again because it
// is transient and covers many rows at once.
//
// The difference is what they are measured AGAINST. Authored, they were an aim
// that landed differently on every terminal: one notch louder on a blacker
// screen, one notch quieter on a lighter one, and close to nothing on a tinted
// page. Derived, they are what the step IS, on whatever ground the terminal
// turned out to have. That is the whole of what the reply buys for this ladder.

//
// A BAND RATHER THAN A POINT, AND A VALUE IN BAND IS NOT TOUCHED. That rule is
// styles.go's own — it is why two steps of the light ladder survived the retune
// that authored the other four — and it is the whole reason this file is a
// correction rather than a second palette. On the terminals the authored ladder
// was aimed at, every reading tier already lands inside its band and the reply
// changes nothing a person can see. It is the grounds the authors could not aim
// at that move: a pure black screen, where the body was climbing past fifteen to
// one and reading as a glare, and a tinted page, where the whole light ladder
// was sliding under the floor at once.

// The three reading tiers and the bands they are held to.
//
// They are a LADDER by construction (styles.go) — the body, the surface's second

// and ordered, and that is what keeps the ladder a ladder no matter which end of
// its band each tier gets pushed to.

// 1.15 to 1.30 is the authored pair read back as a ratio and given room on

// own at 1.24× against white — so both authored pairs are INSIDE this band, and
// A VALUE IN BAND IS NOT TOUCHED keeps them byte-identical on the grounds they
// were aimed at, which is the same restraint the three tiers above get. The two
// numbers themselves live in styles.go, where the palette is authored, and are
// asserted against this band by TestTheLiveTierIsTheGlareLawsOneException.
//
// The ceiling is the half that is load-bearing, and THE GLARE LAW is why: live
// is the one tier deliberately allowed above the ink's own ceiling, and an
// exception with no bound of its own is not an exception, it is a hole. A step
// is what the tier means; a LEAP is a second body white, and a second body white
// on one screen is the exact defect this whole wave removed. So the ceiling is
// the width of a step and nothing more, and the authored table carries a second,
// absolute bound of its own beside it (styles.go's THE GLARE LAW, and
// TestTheLiveTierIsTheGlareLawsOneException, which holds both).

// changed under one is a row that will keep drawing yesterday's colours until
// something else happens to make it stale — and on a transcript that is scrolled
// back through, "something else" may be never. Six caches hold painted text and
// all six are named here rather than trusted to expire:
//
//   - every entry on every deck reachable right now (render.go's build/width/
//     stale key). The conversation, the open room's page, and a run's journal are
//     three separate lists and a person can be looking at any of them
//   - the promoted head of a streaming reply ([entry.mdHead]), whose key is the
//     promotion's cut and the width and so cannot see a ladder move
//   - the block a tool row hangs ([entry.hung]), whose key is the call's own
//     payload and so cannot see one either
//   - the highlighted source blocks (codeview.go), which are painted rows keyed
//     by text and width and nothing else
//   - the laid-out screen list itself, dropped by width so the next frame
//     rebuilds unconditionally
//   - the ROOM'S laid-out list, which is its own cache and not that one
//     (room.go's [app.roomRows])
//
// AND THE ONE THING THAT IS NOT A CACHE: THE STYLER PROSE PAINTS A REPLY WITH.
// A model's markdown is rendered by internal/tui2/prose, which resolves colour
// from internal/tui2/tokens, and the only reason it comes back in THIS palette's
// body white is that markdown.go states the ink on the Styler it hands over
// ([tokens.Styler.WithBodyInk], and styles.go's THE GLARE LAW). That statement
// was made against the ladder in force at startup. Dropping the rows without
// re-making it would repaint the whole surface against the measured ground and
