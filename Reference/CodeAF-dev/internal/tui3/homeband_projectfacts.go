// THE PROJECT CARD'S LAST BAND: THE DIM ARITHMETIC.
//
// One line, under everything, saying how big this project is and when anybody
// was last in it:
//
//	12 conversations · 34 tasks · spent $4.10 · last active 2h
//
// IT IS [homeFacts] SAID ABOUT A PROJECT INSTEAD OF A CONVERSATION, and it
// keeps that function's law to the letter: EVERY CLAUSE IS OMITTED WHEN IT IS
// NOT ONE. A project nobody has run a task in says nothing about tasks; one
// that has spent nothing says nothing about spending; and a line with nothing
// to say is not drawn at all, so a brand-new project's card is a name, a place,
// and no footer — never `0 tasks · $0.00`.
//
// The sums are taken over the project's own sessions — each conversation's own
// spending, stamped on its meta.json, plus its share of the project's task
// index ([session.TaskRollup] is already rolled up per conversation by the
// world's reader) — so this band reads nothing from disk and cannot block.
