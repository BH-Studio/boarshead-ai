// WHAT NEEDS A PERSON IS A FACT ABOUT ONE PIECE OF WORK.
//
// The tasks place used to file a live row under `needs your look` whenever the
// CONVERSATION that ran it was stopped on a question of its own. A conversation
// is stopped on one question — an approval for a command somebody typed in the
// chat, a connect offer, a standing card — and it is almost never about a task,
// so one `can I run: git push` on screen re-filed every running task of that
// conversation under the section a person reads as "the machine has stopped".
//
// These tests pin the fix: the section is read off the row's own state
// ([taskEntryStatus]), and the conversation's question changes nothing about
// where any row is filed.
//
