// A note is where this program talks about itself, and two of them were wrong
// in the same place. The line a resumed session opens on said where the journal
// file lives — four to six wrapped rows of absolute path, first thing on the
// page, where a person's first impression goes. And every note was wrapped two
// cells wider than the column it is drawn in, so the row overshot the frame and
// was clipped with an ellipsis: three characters gone out of the MIDDLE of a
// path, with the row under it carrying on from after the gap.
