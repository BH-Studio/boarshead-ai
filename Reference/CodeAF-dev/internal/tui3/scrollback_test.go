// THE DEFECT THESE TESTS PIN: a resumed conversation could not be scrolled back
// through. Two separate things were suspected of it and only one turned out to
// be true, so both are written down here — the one that was broken so it stays
// fixed, and the one that was not so nobody has to suspect it twice.
//
//   - The replay drew the last [replayTail] blocks and nothing else, and there
//     was no way to ask for more. Scrolling up reached the top of those forty
//     and stopped, with an hour of conversation sitting in the journal
//     underneath it. That is what [app.backfill] answers.
//   - Following the live edge was suspected of yanking a reader back down when
//     a turn streamed or when they typed. It does not, and the tests at the
//     bottom of this file are what keep it that way.

// longPast is a journal with `turns` of the person's messages in it, each one
// answered. The first message names itself so a test can ask whether the
// beginning of the conversation is on screen.
