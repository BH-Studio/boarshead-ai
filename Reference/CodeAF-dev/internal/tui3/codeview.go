// SOURCE INSIDE A TOOL EXPANSION.
//
// Two blocks on this surface are a file rather than a result: the content a
// `write` lays down, and the text a `read` handed back. Both were drawn by
// [app.plainRows] — every row one flat dim — which is right for a build log and
// wrong for eighty lines of Go, where the shape a reader is looking for is
// carried by exactly the things a lexer knows about.
//
// THE HIGHLIGHTER IS NOT HERE, for the reason internal/tui3's markdown.go
// already gives about fences: internal/tui2/prose owns chroma and the one chroma
// style built from the tokens ramp, and a second copy of that two-hundred-row
// table is a table that drifts. This file is the two things prose leaves to a
// caller — which lexer, and how loud.
//
// HOW LOUD IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. [prose.HighlightLine] paints a run the lexer
// named at its slot on the ramp and everything else at the tier the caller
// states, so a block lights up only where there is meaning and keeps the
// expansion's own quiet voice everywhere else. The tier here is
// [tokens.TextTertiary] — the ramp's dim end, the tier this surface's own
// telemetry sits at — so an opened write reads as evidence somebody may skim,
// not as an editor window somebody opened. No new colour table is invented and
// none could be: the palette is the token layer's.

// codeTier is the grey a highlighted block's unlexed text sits at. It is the
// dim end of the tokens ramp, chosen to sit where [palette.dim] sits, so a
// highlighted expansion and a plain one read as the same kind of block.
const codeTier = tokens.TextTertiary

// codeRows is [app.plainRows] for text that is SOURCE: one row per line,
// truncated to width and never wrapped, lexed as the language of path and
// painted at [codeTier].
//
// It degrades to [app.plainRows] in three cases, and every one of them is the
// same judgement — that nothing here would be told apart by colour:
//
//   - the linear tier, where the surface is being read aloud rather than looked
//     at, and a keyword announces itself no differently from an identifier
//   - a path chroma's registry claims no lexer for, where the alternative is
//     chroma's fallback lexer painting a log file as though it were code
//   - a path that arrived empty, which is a call whose payload never carried one
//
// Lines are lexed ONE AT A TIME, which is what lets each be fitted to the width
// before it is painted — measuring a string through escape sequences measures it
// wrong. The cost is a construct that spans rows: a block comment or a raw
// string literal is coloured by what each of its lines looks like alone. That is
// the same bargain internal/tui2's record rows make, and it is the only one
// available to a preview whose first line has not arrived yet.

	// and forty milliseconds for the eight hundred a person gets after clicking
	// "… N more lines" on a large read. Forty milliseconds is past the whole
	// frame budget.
	//
	// The inline block a tool row hangs has a memo in front of this one now
	// (toolview.go's [toolBlock]), so the ordinary transcript asks for a given
	// block once rather than thirty times a second. This still runs per frame for
	// everything that reaches the renderer another way — the phone's full-frame
	// sheet redraws from [app.detailBody] on every tick (expand.go), a forming
	// write is re-lexed as its own body arrives — and it is what keeps the memo's
	// misses cheap.
	//
	// THE KEY IS EVERYTHING THAT DECIDES A ROW. The text, the width and the

	// the two that would otherwise go stale, because a person switching theme
	// changes both and neither changes a byte of the text.
