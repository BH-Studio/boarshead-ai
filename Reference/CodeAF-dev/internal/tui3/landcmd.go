// PUTTING THE WORK INTO THE FOLDER — /land, and the line that says there is
// something to land.
//
// Where the conversation stands it writes; where it only REFERS to a folder,
// its edits are kept in a copy of that folder and go in when somebody says so
// (internal/session/standingtree.go). This file is that "somebody says so".
//
// ── SHOWN FIRST, THEN DONE ──
//
// `/land` never moves a file. It says which folder, how many files, and names
// the first few; `/land now` is what actually puts them in. That split is the
// design's own law and not caution for its own sake: referring to a folder is
// allowed to be casual — inference, a dropped directory, a path in a sentence —
// precisely BECAUSE certainty is placed at the landing rather than at the
// referring. The one moment a person has to be sure is the one moment they are
// shown exactly what changes. It is the shape /cache clean already asks in
// (cachecmd.go), for the same reason and in the same words.
//
// ── AND THE LINE ABOVE THE BOX ──
//
// [app.landRow] is drawn only while something is waiting, and says nothing at
// all otherwise: a folder the conversation merely referred to is not news, and
// a permanent row naming it would be inventory. What is news is that there are
// changes somewhere that are not in the person's folder yet, which is exactly
// what the row says and the only thing it says.
