// THE ROOM: A QUESTION IS A PLACE TOO, AND YOU CAN GO THERE.
//
// docs/design/questions/DESIGN.md gives a question four sizes, and this file is
// the largest of them: "a page over the conversation (the task-room idiom): head
// and attribution, options as sections (▸/▾, bodies, blocks), x compare on the
// asker's dimensions, c comment on the focused part, ? ask back, the foot
// composes the answer (pick · with · notes · scope), d you decide shows the pick
// and reason first, D sets the dial for the kind."
//
// A ROOM IS FOR A QUESTION WHOSE EVIDENCE DOES NOT FIT ON A CARD. The card can
// hold a word and a consequence per answer; it cannot hold the diagram the asker
// drew, the diff each answer produces, or three paragraphs about what a schema
// change costs. A person handed that on a card either answers without reading it
// or asks the model to say it all again in the thread — which is the same
// evidence, unstructured, in the one place it cannot be compared. So the
// evidence sets the size of the drawing, and this is the size it sets when there
// is a lot of it.
//
// ── IT IS A VIEW, NOT A SECOND APP, AND NOT A MODAL ──
//
// room.go's law, kept verbatim: nothing under this page stops. The turn goes on
// streaming into [app.entries], the roster goes on ticking, and the ONLY thing
// that changes is which rows [app.bodyRows] hands the frame. `esc` restores the
// conversation exactly, scroll included, because the conversation was never
// touched — this page keeps an offset of its own.
//
// AND THE BOX STAYS LIVE, which is the questions law the consent block does not
// keep: "NEVER MODAL, NEVER SUSPENDS THE KEYBOARD. The box stays live; typing
// after › is answering with words". Every letter this page takes it takes only
// while the box is EMPTY, exactly as `x` (stop) is taken on this surface today,
// so a person mid-sentence never loses a keystroke to a question.
//
// ── THE PAGE IS DRAWN IN questionpage.go ──
//
// This file is the page's STATE and its KEYS: what the reader is standing on,
// what the foot has composed, and what each key does. How it is laid out — the
// two panes at a hundred columns and wider, the one column narrower, the two
// windows and what a press reaches — is questionpage.go's, drawn with the
// evidence renderer every question drawing shares (questionevidence.go).
//
// ── THE POINTER, AND THE WAYS TO MOVE IT ──
//
// `↑`/`↓` walk the answers and the evidence beside them follows; `enter` takes
// the answer the pointer is on, which is the block's own law arriving on the
// page (#789); a digit moves the pointer straight to its answer. Where there are
// two panes, `→` hands the arrows to the evidence so a long diagram can be read
// to its end and `←` hands them back. And a click on an answer's row moves the
// pointer onto it, with a second click on the same row being `enter` — one press
// to read, one to decide ([app.questionRoomPress] says why it is two).
//
// ── ALIGNMENT, STATED ONCE ──
//
// DESIGN.md: "Head at the gutter; option rows indented one key-cell; answers row
// indented like the options". So everything on the page is indented
// [questionIndent], the answers' rows are the panel's own, and a shape's parts
// are indented one further key-cell ([questionBodyIndent]) so a part and what is
// written under it cannot be misread as two answers.

	// questionIndent is the one key-cell every row under the head is indented by.
	questionIndent = "  "
	// questionBodyIndent is what is written under one part of a shape — a note
