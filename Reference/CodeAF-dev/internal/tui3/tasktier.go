// tasktier.go is THE ONE PLACE THIS SURFACE TURNS A READING INTO A CELL AND A
// ROW.
//
// Every task row, rail line and roster entry answers ONE question before it says
// anything else: do I need to do anything? There are three answers
// ([session.TaskTier]), each has one glyph and one word, and a person who has
// learned the glyphs has learned the whole system
// (docs/design/task-states/DESIGN.md).
//
// BEFORE THIS FILE THE SURFACE HAD FOUR TABLES. The rail worked a cell out of
// the state and the merge word, the roster worked one out of the presence, home
// worked out a third, and the record page spelled its own words for all of them
// — so a task a person stopped drew one mark on the roster and another on its
// own page, and one landing was called `needs your look`, `awaiting review` and
// `unverified` on three screens a keypress apart. The tables disagreed because
// there were four of them. There is one now, and it reads
// [session.TaskStatus.Tier]: NO SURFACE WORKS A TIER OUT OF A STATE FOR ITSELF.
//
// The words are internal/session's and are never respelled here. What belongs to
// this file is the DRAWING: which cell, which hue, and how a row that will not
// fit gives ground.

// The task-state marks, and THE ONE PLACE THIS SURFACE NAMES THEM. Each is a
// slot in the shared vocabulary (internal/tui2/tokens), which is where the
// three spellings of every mark live: the Font Awesome 4 icon a patched font
// draws, the geometric floor every terminal draws, and the one ASCII character
// a screen reader can name.
//
// NOTHING HERE IS A CHARACTER. A mark spelled as a literal draws the plain
// floor forever — a literal cannot know which repertoire the terminal is on —
// which is how a person with a patched font came to see a proper icon beside
// every tool call and a bare geometric shape beside every task
// (docs/design/icons/DESIGN.md). internal/iconlaw fails the build on a state mark
// spelled anywhere in this package, or in any other surface package.

// glyphRunASCII is the screen reader's own working mark, for the rows that draw
// their own spinner and need nothing from the table but the still stand-in the
// linear tier gets ([tokens.ASCII] never animates). It is the vocabulary's, not
// a character spelled here.
var glyphRunASCII = tokens.ASCII.Glyph(tokens.GWorking)

// tierSlot is the tier in one SLOT, and it is the whole of what this file
// decides about which shape a row wears.
//
// SEVEN SLOTS AND NO EIGHTH. Moving is `○` while nothing is turning, `⚑` while
// it is waiting on something else and `◐` while something is happening; over is
// `✓`, `■` or `✕` for the three ways work ends; your call is `?` and only ever
// `?`. The `!` this surface used to draw for unfinished work is gone: it was a
// fourth answer to a question that has three, and it left a person deciding
// whether a `!` was louder than a `✕`.
//
// THE SHAPE ALONE SAYS THE STATE. Not one of the seven needs its hue to be told
// from the others, which is the test a mark has to pass to enter this table:
// the roster is read by people who have turned colour off, and by people who
// cannot see it.
