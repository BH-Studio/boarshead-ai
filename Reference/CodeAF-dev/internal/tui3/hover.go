// HOVER: the surface answers the pointer before it is clicked.
//
// Every interactive thing on this screen was already clickable and none of it
// LOOKED clickable, which on a terminal is worse than on a page: there is no
// underline, no cursor change, no affordance at all except the one the surface
// draws. So the row under the pointer takes one step up in background and its
// own marker brightens, and a row that answers to nothing does not react —
// which is the useful half. A hover style everything wears is a hover style
// that says nothing about what can be pressed.
//
// What reacts: a tool row and its expansion, the "N earlier tool calls" fold,
// the "… N more lines" foot, a thinking block, a sign-in still waiting, a task
// reference inside somebody's paragraph, the consent choices, the two answers on
// the stop card, a message parked above the box, the chips on the task strip and
// on the tray, the room's pinned header and the ✕ riding it, the targets on an
// adaptive run's page, the model's name at the foot of the frame, and the rows of
// whichever list, page or card is open. That set is not a taste — it is exactly
// the set [app.press] and the overlays already act on, read from the same row map
// the click hit-testing reads (render.go's row.hit, and view.go's chrome
// marks). Two definitions of "interactive" is how a surface ends up glowing at
// a row that does nothing.
//
// AND IT REACTS AT THE SIZE OF THE THING, not at the size of the row it is drawn
// on. Half of what is listed above shares its line with something else — four
// chips on a strip, two answers on a card, three references in one sentence — so
// a background band across the row would be the surface promising a door at every
// cell of it. Whatever is under the pointer lights; its neighbours do not. Where
// a target really is the whole row (a parked message, a deck row, the header) the
// whole row lights, and that is the same rule and not an exception to it.
//
// The tracking is deliberately cheap. A pointer crossing the window sends one
// motion message per cell, and each one asks where it landed and repaints only
// if the answer CHANGED — moving along a five-row tool expansion is one
// repaint, not five.
//
// AND "CHEAP" IS A CEILING NOW RATHER THAN A CLAIM. A motion that changed
// nothing leaves no stale entry, no dirty flag and no command behind it, and a
// motion that crossed a boundary leaves exactly two — the entry that lost the
// highlight and the one that gained it. Both are stated as tests
// (inputsmooth_test.go), because the cost of a message that arrives per CELL is
// the sort of thing that grows a little at a time until a pointer moved over a
// link is a surface that stutters.

// hoverKind is what the pointer is over.

	// It is a kind of its own rather than a [hoverFold] for that one's own
	// stated reason, said one door along: a room's page is one turn carrying a
	// cluster's fold line AND a chip per settled phase, and the two are numbered
	// in different systems — so a pointer resting on the chip named 1 would
	// light the tool fold of turn 1 as well, which is two rows brightening for
	// one pointer on a surface whose whole hover law is that a row lights on
	// exactly the cells a click acts on.
	hoverWorkFold
	// hoverBrief is the door under a node's folded instruction (brieffold.go).
	// It is a kind of its own rather than a hoverFold because that one is keyed
	// by TURN and the instruction shares its turn with the node's first calls —
	// so a pointer on one door would light the other. And it is not a hoverEntry
	// because that brightens the WHOLE block, which is right for "click to
	// expand" and wrong here: the three lines above the door are the person's own
	// words and a press on them does nothing.
	hoverBrief

	// file, read the other way round.
	hoverSettle
	// hoverOverlay is one row of the open list; index is its row in that list.
	// While the context chooser is up it is one row of THAT sheet, counted from

	// modal now and no longer one of the lists in the bottom chrome
	// (contextmodal.go's [contextWin]).
	hoverOverlay

	// It is a kind of its own rather than a row because it is narrower than the
	// rule it rides, and pressing a rule means nothing (contextmodal.go).
	hoverContextCancel
	// hoverSheet is one row of the settings panel; index is its item
	// (settings.go). The panel is fullscreen, so while it is up this is the
	// only kind the pointer can produce.
	hoverSheet
	// hoverWelcome is one recent-session row of the welcome box; index is its
	// slot (welcome.go).
	hoverWelcome
	// hoverRewind is a CUT the pointer is offering while the rewind mode is up
	// (rewind.go); index is the point a click would choose. It is a kind of its
	// own rather than a hoverEntry because the row that brightens is not the row
	// under the pointer — it is the block the cut would land above, which is
	// wherever the nearest point at or above the pointer happens to be.
	hoverRewind
	// hoverJump is the jump-to-latest chip floating in the frame's breathing gap
	// (jumpchip.go). It was the FIRST hover target on this surface narrower than
	// the row it is drawn on, which is why [app.hoverTarget] is asked the COLUMN as
	// well as the row; most of the kinds under it are narrow now too.
	hoverJump
	// hoverRail is a node row of the roster, and the identity it carries is the
	// NODE's (task.go). Every row of that column is a door into a node's room, so
	// every row of it reacts — which is this file's own law read the other way
	// round: the set that lights is the set [app.press] acts on, and in the
	// roster that is all of it.
	hoverRail
	// hoverRailGroup is a folding group's heading in the roster (`Done 7 ▸`),
	// index its group. The whole row lights because a press anywhere on it
	// opens the group or folds it.
	hoverRailGroup
	// hoverRailArea is the roster's non-node space. The rail remains one
	// pointer target even between rows, because its footer offer follows the
	// hand across the whole column.
	hoverRailArea
	// hoverRailSeam is the two-cell resize handle at the rail's left edge.
	// It is separate from the row behind it so the handle can light without
	// painting that node as a door.
	hoverRailSeam
	// hoverRailGrip is the CLOSED column's edge — the two columns down the right
	// of the frame that a stowed roster leaves behind (task.go's [railGripCols]).
	// It is its own kind and not a [hoverRailArea] because there is no roster
	// there to be an area of: everything that asks about the rail's rows would
	// answer about a column that is not on the frame.
	hoverRailGrip
	// hoverMarginDoor is one of the margin's two `+` rows, held by the SLASH WORD
	// it types (margin.go): there are two of them and they type two different
	// things, so the word is what tells them apart — and it is what the paint
	// asks by, which keeps the row that lights and the row that answers one row.
	hoverMarginDoor
	// hoverMarginStand is one standing order's row in that same margin, held by
	// the order's own id for [hoverOrch]'s reason: an order is named by a string
	// and the column is rebuilt every frame, so a hover stored as a row of it
	// would follow the scroll instead of following the order.
	hoverMarginStand
	// hoverRailMore is the footer's OTHER door — the one line that leaves the
	// column for the task page (taskview.go's [taskSheetPastHint]). It is a kind
	// of its own because it belongs to no node, and it does something different
	// from every other line of the footer.
	hoverRailMore
	// hoverRailStanding is the footer's standing count — `◦ 2 standing orders`,
	// a door onto /standing (standdoor.go). It is a kind of its own for
	// [hoverRailMore]'s reason and one more: it was a segment of the status row
	// until 2026-09-09, and what lights has to be what the press acts on
	// wherever the line is drawn.
	hoverRailStanding
	// hoverTaskSheet is one row of the task page; index is its item
	// (taskview.go). It is a kind of its own rather than another [hoverSheet]
	// because the two pages number their rows out of different lists, and a
	// pointer that left the settings panel with a hover on item nine would light
	// the ninth task the moment this page opened.
	hoverTaskSheet
	// hoverStatusModel is the MODEL SEGMENT of the status row — the name of what
	// is answering, at the foot of the frame, which is a control as well as a
	// label (render.go's [app.identityParts]). It is asked about the column for the
	// jump chip's reason: the telemetry beside it is figures rather than controls,
	// and a name that brightened from forty cells away would be claiming the whole
	// row is a door.
	//
	// IT COVERS BOTH SUBJECTS AND NEEDS NO SECOND KIND. Out in the conversation
	// the segment is the session's model and a press opens the picker; inside a
	// room it is the node's and a press retargets that node. What lights is the
	// same span in both, because what lights is what [app.press] acts on — and
	// where the press would do nothing, the render records no span and this
	// answers nothing (room.go's [app.roomModelMovable]).
	hoverStatusModel
	// hoverSeamProject is the project path on the message-box seam.
	hoverSeamProject
	// hoverEffort is the THINKING RUNG on the seam, the cell drawn immediately
	// after the model's name (effortchip.go). It is a kind of its own rather than
	// a second reading of [hoverStatusModel] for [hoverKeeping]'s reason: two
	// cells side by side that do two different things — one opens the picker, one
	// walks the ladder a step — and what lights has to be what the press acts on.
	hoverEffort
	// hoverMoney is the money segment of the status row, which is a door onto
	// the Spending tab (moneydoor.go). It is a kind of its own rather than a
	// second reading of [hoverStatusModel] for the reason that one covers both of
	// ITS subjects with one kind: what lights has to be what the press acts on,
	// and two doors on one row open two different things.
	hoverMoney
	// hoverMeter is the context meter's door onto /status, one more the status
	// row grew when it became a ledger (foot.go). The open count was another
	// and is off the row entirely; the standing count is [hoverRailStanding]
	// now; and the YOLO badge was a fourth until the gate's posture moved to
	// the seam as a control, where it lights as [hoverApproval].
	hoverMeter
	// hoverApproval is the APPROVALS CHIP on the seam, the cell after the
	// thinking rung (approvalchip.go), its own kind for [hoverEffort]'s reason:
	// a press on it walks the gate and not the ladder.
	hoverApproval
	// hoverTable is the foot under a markdown table that was cut (mdtable.go);
	// entry is the answer it belongs to and index is which of that answer's
	// tables. It is a kind of its own rather
	// than a hoverEntry because a hoverEntry brightens the WHOLE block — which is
	// right for a tool call and wrong for a paragraph, where the pressable thing
	// is three words at the end of a table.
	hoverTable
	// hoverStrip is one CHIP of the task strip, and the identity it carries is
	// the NODE's for [hoverRail]'s reason (taskstrip.go): the row re-packs itself
	// as work starts and lands, so a hover stored as "the second chip" would
	// follow the packing instead of following the work.
	hoverStrip
	// hoverStripHarness is the harness chip that leads that row, whose door is the
	// panel rather than a room (harnesspanel.go). It belongs to no node, which is
	// why it cannot be a [hoverStrip] carrying an id.
	hoverStripHarness
	// hoverStripMore is the `+N` at the row's end, whose door is the whole roster
	// (task.go's [app.railTake]). It is a third kind for the reason the second one
	// is: three things share that line and no two of them go to the same place.
	hoverStripMore
	// hoverRoomBack is the room's pinned header, which is the way out for the
	// pointer (room.go's [app.roomBackPress]). The whole row lights, because the
	// whole row is what the press acts on.
	hoverRoomBack
	// hoverRoomStop is the ✕ riding the right end of that header (stop.go's
	// [app.stopMarkPress]). It is a kind of its own and not part of the row above
	// it because ending work and leaving the page you were watching it on are
	// opposite gestures — so the two never light together, and the expensive one
	// wins the cells it is drawn on.
	hoverRoomStop
	// hoverCrumb is one step of the breadcrumb trail on that same header, and
	// index is the COLUMN it starts on (roomcrumbs.go). It outranks the row it
	// rides for [hoverRoomStop]'s reason — a crumb goes to one particular place
	// and the row goes back to the conversation, so the two never light together
	// — and it answers only for crumbs that are doors, which is what keeps the
	// page's own name and another conversation's chain as quiet as they are
	// inert.
	hoverCrumb
	// hoverTab is one conversation on the tab strip above that header, and index
	// is the COLUMN it starts on (chattabs.go). It is a kind of its own and not a
	// crumb because the two answer for different rows and mean different things —
	// a tab is WHICH CONVERSATION, a crumb is where inside it — and, like the
	// crumbs, it answers only for the pieces that are doors, which is what keeps
	// the tab already up as quiet as it is inert.
	hoverTab
	// hoverStopAnswer is one of the stop card's two answers; index is which
	// (stop.go). Two presses share that row, so it is a chip and not a row for
	// [hoverSettle]'s reason.
	hoverStopAnswer
	// hoverTabCloseAnswer is one of the close-a-tab card's three answers; index
	// is which (tabclose.go). It is the card next door's arrangement for the
	// card next door's reason: three presses share one row.
	hoverTabCloseAnswer
	// hoverParked is one MESSAGE waiting for the answer to finish; index is its
	// place in the queue (park.go). Every row that message wrapped over lights,
	// because the press pulls the whole message back into the box — and the dim
	// line under the block belongs to no message and lights not at all.
	hoverParked
	// hoverQueued is one MESSAGE the session is holding for after this turn;
	// index is its place in the queue (followup.go). It is the parked hover's
	// twin read off the session's queue: every row that message wrapped over
	// lights, because the press takes the whole message back out of the queue.
	// It lights only where the agent can give a message back (followup.go's
	// [app.followRows]); there is no line under the block to light.
	hoverQueued
	// hoverChip is one thing on the tray above the box; index is the picture it
	// names, or [trayHarnessChip] for the picked harness's own cell (attach.go,
	// harnesspick.go). A press takes that one thing off, so that one thing lights.
	hoverChip
	// hoverOrch is one target on an adaptive run's page, held by KEY rather than
	// by row (roomorch.go's [orchSpot.key]): the page is re-laid every poll, so a
	// hover stored as a row of it would follow the redraw instead of the chip. One
	// key can cover three rows on a phone, which is right — a chip drawn as a
	// stack of rows is one object.
	hoverOrch
	// hoverTaskCard is one region of the task record card; index is
	// [taskCardHead] or [taskCardFoot] (taskrecord.go). The card's edges are the
	// way back and its body is read, so the edges are exactly what lights.
	hoverTaskCard
	// hoverLink is one inline task reference inside a block of the model's prose;
	// entry is the block and index is which of its references (markdown.go's
	// [linkifyTasks]). It is the third narrow target in the transcript and the
	// most crowded one — a paragraph can name four nodes — so the words under the
	// pointer brighten and the sentence around them does not.
	hoverLink
	// hoverDeck is one of the phone status deck's two rows; index is which
	// (statusdeck.go). The whole row lights because [app.deckPress] takes every
	// press that lands on either of them.
	hoverDeck
	// hoverRewindSheet is one row of the rewind timeline; index is its row in that
	// page's list (rewindsheet.go). It is a kind of its own rather than another
	// [hoverRewind] because that one is an index into the POINTS the inline mode
	// is walking and this is an index into a list of transcript rows, and the two
	// are numbered out of different things — a pointer that left one surface with
	// a hover on item nine would light somebody else's row the moment the other
	// opened.
	hoverRewindSheet
	// hoverQuestionOption is one ANSWER on the page a question opens into;
	// index is which (questionroom.go). Only the answer's own row lights,
	// because only that row answers to a press: its body is prose, evidence and
	// the person's own notes, and a paragraph that brightened would be
	// promising a door on every sentence of it.
	hoverQuestionOption
	// hoverDockLabel is the dock's door, `▦ All`, glyph and word as one
	// button, and hoverDockWall the `▦` alone on a row too narrow for the
	// word (walldock.go). Either lights the whole door. hoverDockCell is
	// one conversation's cell after them, held by the conversation's key
	// rather than by its column (walldock.go): the dock narrows as the keys
	// beside it change, and a hover stored as a column would follow the
	// packing instead of the conversation.
	hoverDockLabel
	hoverDockWall
	hoverDockCell
	// hoverSide is one of the side column's own rows or doors (sidecol.go):
	// key is the row's identity and index the door on it, -1 for the row as a
	// whole. A row is held by its key and not by its place because the band
	// and the Traffic re-lay as things arrive.
	hoverSide

	// entry and the message it shows (teamthreadcard.go).
