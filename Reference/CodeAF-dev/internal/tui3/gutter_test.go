// THE READING GUTTER (gutter.go). These are the questions the pass has to keep
// answering: that the air is there, that the row is no wider for it, that a
// frame with no columns to spare does not buy it, and — the whole reason the
// pass is more than a `"  " +` — that every target a click resolves BY COLUMN
// moved with the words it names.
//
// Every column assertion below reads the span back against THE DRAWN ROW. A
// test that read a card's span table and compared it with itself would agree
// with any gutter at all, including a wrong one: that is exactly how a shift
// like this ships green and answers clicks two columns to the left.

// with one thing the person said and one thing the model answered.
