// ── THE SWEEP, IN A BOX ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// dragselect.go answers the sweep over the TRANSCRIPT and states the law it is
// answering: mouse reporting takes the terminal's own drag-select away, so the
// one gesture every terminal user owns has to be answered in kind. This file is
// the same bargain kept in the boxes — the message box at the foot of a
// conversation and the composer every place draws at the foot of its own screen
// — where the gesture reached nothing at all, because a press the box has
// already taken never parks a drag.
//
// Press, sweep, and the run under the pointer wears the selection; release, and
// its text is on the clipboard over OSC 52, with the same word on the status
// line the transcript's own copy puts there. A double-click takes the word, a
// triple-click takes the line, and a plain click is still the caret placement
// draftclick.go put there.
//
// ── AND THE SELECTION STAYS AFTERWARDS, WHICH THE TRANSCRIPT'S DOES NOT ──
//
// A copied run in the transcript is lit for three seconds and then forgotten,
// because there is nothing else to do with text you cannot edit. A box is
// different: the selection it is left holding is LIVE — type and it is
// replaced, backspace and it is gone (editselect.go) — so it stays until the
// caret moves or the text changes, exactly as it does in every text field.
//
// ── ONE BOX AT A TIME, HELD BY POINTER ──
//
// The sweep remembers WHICH box it began in and extends that one for as long as
// the button is down, rather than re-asking the frame on every motion. A hand
// sweeping down the last line of a draft leaves the box's rows entirely, and a
// sweep that re-resolved would stop dead at the boundary instead of running to
// the end of the text, which is what a sweep does everywhere else.

// boxDrag is a sweep over a text box.
type boxDrag struct {
	// box is the editor the press landed in, held for the life of the gesture.
	// The editors it points at live in the app itself — the message box, a
	// place's own box, the shared composer — so the pointer outlives every
	// frame the sweep crosses.

	// the slop is still a click and not a one-character selection.

// boxPressed is what a box's own press handler calls once it has put the caret
// under the pointer: it arms the sweep, and answers the double- and
// triple-click on the spot.
