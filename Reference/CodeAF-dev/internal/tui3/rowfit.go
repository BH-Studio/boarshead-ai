// ── ROWFIT — ONE LINE, LAID OUT BY WHAT IT IS FOR ───────────────────────────
//
// Every list on this surface draws the same shape: a thing's NAME on the left,
// and a dim tail of facts about it on the right. What was missing was an answer
// to the only question a narrow terminal asks — WHICH FACTS GO FIRST — and in
// its absence every row answered it by accident. The picker's tail was joined
// into one string and then cut with an ellipsis, so a sixty-cell frame drew
// `1M · $3/$15 per…` (a price sliced in half, which is a wrong number) beside
// `anthropic/claude-son…` (a name that could be either of two models). Both
// halves cut, neither readable, and the row's whole purpose — telling one model
// from another — was the first thing spent.
//
// THE LAW THIS FILE HOLDS:
//
//  1. THE IDENTITY IS WHOLE OR THE ROW IS POINTLESS. The primary — the model's
//     id, the lane's name — keeps every cell it asks for before any fact gets
//     one, and it is truncated only when the frame cannot hold it ALONE. A
//     person scanning a list is matching names; a name they cannot match is a
//     row they have to open to read.
//
//  2. FACTS DEGRADE BEFORE THEY DISAPPEAR. Each fact carries up to three
//     spellings — the full one, a short one, a bare glyph or number — and the
//     fitter takes the longest that fits. `$0.08/$0.15 per M` becomes `$0.15/M`
//     becomes `$0.15`, and the fact stays on the row three widths longer than
//     it otherwise would.
//
//  3. THE TAIL IS A PREFIX OF ITSELF. Facts are added in priority order and the
//     first one that will not fit ENDS the tail; nothing later is skipped
//     forward into the gap. This is what makes a narrow row honest — every row
//     at every width shows the same ranked facts from the top — and it is what
//     keeps a person from reading `elo 1300` and concluding the price is
//     unpublished when it merely did not fit.
//
//  4. UNKNOWN IS NOT NARROW. A fact nobody published has no spellings at all,
//     draws nothing, costs nothing and does NOT end the tail (the emptiness
//     law, design-law-v2 §16). Absence for want of a figure and absence for
//     want of a cell are the same silence on the screen, so the ranked prefix
//     is the only thing that keeps the second kind explicable.
//
// The fitter is pure and deterministic: the same plan at the same width is the
// same two strings, which is what lets a test paste a row.

// rowSep is what joins two facts, and rowGutter is the least space between the
// name and the first of them. Both are the values every list on this surface
// already used; they are named here because the arithmetic now happens in one
// place instead of in each caller's head.
// rowGutter IS TWO CELLS AND NOT ONE. A single space is not a gutter, it is a
// word space: at eighty columns the Spending tab drew
//
//	per task no limit of its own · it spends against the day and this conversation
//
// — a label and a tail that exactly filled the frame, and the eye read `per task
// no limit` as one sentence. Every other row on that tab had a wide gutter, so
// the one row that ran out of room was also the one row whose column structure
// disappeared, which is the opposite of what a fitter is for. At two, a tail
// that cannot leave two cells drops its last FACT instead (law 3), which is a
// row that still reads.

// not a fact — "via coreweave" and "coreweave" name the same machine — so
