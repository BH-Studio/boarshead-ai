// THE @ COMPLETION: type @ and two characters, and the files under this
// directory are offered.
//
// It is the same overlay grammar as the command list and the model picker
// (palette.go), opened by typing rather than by a key, and it inserts TEXT and
// nothing else. THE SURFACE DOES NOT READ THE FILE: what is submitted is
// "@internal/session/agent.go" exactly as it stands in the sentence, and the
// agent's read tool resolves it if it wants to. Inlining the contents here
// would be the surface deciding, on a person's behalf, to spend a hundred
// thousand tokens they never asked to send — and it would do it silently, in a
// box that shows one line of what it sent.
//
// A PICTURE IS THE ONE EXCEPTION, and it is not an exception to that rule but a
// consequence of it: no tool on the belt turns a PNG into anything a model can
// look at, so the path in the sentence would be a path nobody can resolve. An
// image row is therefore tagged "img" and choosing it ATTACHES the file instead
// of typing it — see attach.go, which owns everything that happens after.
//
// The same list answers a command's path argument ("/image shot.png", "/export
// notes.md"), opened by tab rather than by "@" and committing the path as text,
// because there the path IS what the line says.

// THE @ ALSO OFFERS TASKS, AND THEY SIT ABOVE THE FILES. See taskmention.go
// for the whole of that half — the index it reads, the sections it draws, and
// the pointer block a chosen task becomes at submit. What is in THIS file is
// only what the two halves share: one list, one cursor, one scroll.
//
// The reason they share a list rather than opening a second overlay is the
// reason this surface has one overlay grammar at all (palette.go): "@" means
// "something I want to point at", and a person reaching for it does not yet
// know whether the thing they are reaching for is a file or a piece of work
// somebody did last week. Two lists would make them decide before they can see
// either.

// The completion's four bounds. The walk is capped so that an @ typed inside a
// home directory cannot become a filesystem crawl; the list shows a screenful,
// and a screenful with tasks on it is allowed to be taller because the tasks
// come with section rules that are not themselves choices; the list opens on
// the bare @ and the query narrows it from there.
