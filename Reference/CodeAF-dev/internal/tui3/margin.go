// THE MARGIN: ONE COLUMN, THREE SECTIONS, AND A DOOR AT THE FOOT OF THE TWO THAT HAVE ONE.
//
// The column on the right has been this conversation's WORK and nothing else
// (task.go's rail). Everything else standing over the conversation — the orders
// that keep being true while nobody is looking — lived on a page a person had to
// know the name of, behind a count on the status row (standdoor.go). Two things
// govern a conversation and only one of them was on the frame.
//
// So the column carries both. Real rows earn dim labels in the words the
// product already uses:
//
//	tasks
//	⠙ Fix nil-map             #7
//	+ /task
//
//	standing
//	◦ keep the tests green
//	◦ never touch the API   everywhere
//	+ /standing
//
// ── THE LAWS THIS FILE APPLIES ──
//
//   - THE DOORS ARE GEOGRAPHY AND THE LABELS DESCRIBE CONTENT. The `+` rows
//     teach both places before anything exists; an empty label would spend a row
//     to announce absence, which the emptiness law forbids.
//
//   - THE `+` ROW TYPES, IT DOES NOT ARM. Pressing it puts the slash word and a
//     space in the draft and hands the keyboard back — visible, deletable text,
//     no mode, no form. The mechanism a person can see is the mechanism they can
//     learn: the next time they want one they type the word themselves.
//
//   - TWO ROWS OF PERMANENT INK AND NO MORE. The `+` rows are the whole of what
//     this file adds to a column that is otherwise the session's own news.
//     Anything else worth saying about an order is on
//     the order's page, one press away.
//
//   - THE GLYPH CARRIES THE HUE (docs/HOME-BRIDGE.md's colour law). `▲` wears
//     the waiting hue on the one row where a person is genuinely being waited on
//     — the amber every surface says "waiting on you" in, since the question
//     violet was retired on 2026-09-11 (styles.go) — the breathing `●` wears the
//     muted voice the spinner already speaks in, and everything else — the title,
//     the scope tail, the labels — is calm.
//
//   - A SCOPE TAIL ONLY WHERE THE SCOPE IS NOT THE DEFAULT. An order made in a
//     chat governs the project ([standing.AltitudeProject] is the zero value), so
//     saying so on every row would be printing the default in the one column with
//     no room to spare. The two that are not the default say which they are
//     ([standScopeTail]).
//
// TASKS NEVER CARRY A SCOPE MARK. A task is this conversation's, always; scope is
// a standing order's concept and belongs to nothing else on this column.

// The margin's own words. Both labels are words this product already uses for
// these two things, and both are quoted in internal/manual/chat's pages exactly
// as they are spelled here.

// history fills whatever is left ([marginJobsFit]).
const marginJobsCost = 2

// marginTitleFloor is how little room a standing row's title may be left with

//
// IT IS CACHED ON HOME'S OWN BEAT, for [app.keepingCount]'s reason and it is the
