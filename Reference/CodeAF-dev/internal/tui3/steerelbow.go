//
// The engine's account of this is internal/session/steer.go, and the sentence
// that matters up here is its first: A STEER INTERRUPTS THE CURRENT GENERATION
// AND NOT THE TURN. The request in flight is cut, the assistant text that had
// already arrived stays where it is, and the SAME question carries on from the
// person's words. So the correction is not a new question — it keeps the ELBOW
// rather than the person's own `›`, because the mark says "still the same
// question" where a turn glyph would say "a new one" — and it is a block of the
// transcript like any other, at the position it arrived at.
//
// ── THE DEFECT THIS SHAPE ENDS ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The elbows used to hang off the TRUNK: the block that opened the turn. On a
// turn with any work in it that block is above every tool row, and on a turn
// long enough to scroll it is above the top of the screen — so a person who
// pressed `→` watched their sentence leave the waiting strip and appear
// nowhere. "steering in chat when I press it the message just seems to
// disappear." It was on the page the whole time, forty rows up, under a
// question they could no longer see.
//
// Position is not decoration here. It is the one thing a transcript carries
// that a list of sentences does not: WHEN each was said, relative to the work
// around it. The engine's own journal already keeps a steer in place — an
// ordinary user message in the middle of the turn's messages
// (internal/session's sessionfile.go) — so drawing it in place is the surface
// agreeing with the record rather than re-arranging it.
//
// WHAT THE OTHER READING COSTS, AND WHY THE GLYPH STAYS. A steer is an ordinary
// user message in the transcript — it has to be, because that is what the model
// reads — so drawn with the person's own `›` a corrected turn read as a run of
// unrelated questions from somebody who kept interrupting themselves. The elbow
// is what keeps that from happening without moving the words: one mark says
// "this is the same question, continued", and the turn counter is not bumped
// for it (app.go's [app.submittingShown] only counts a message that started a
// stream), so nothing above or below it changes turn.
//
// ── THE INK, AND WHY IT IS THIS ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A STEER IS PART OF THE QUESTION'S FACT AND NEVER A NEW ACCENT. THE ACCENT
// BUDGET (docs/DESIGN-LANGUAGE.md) is one lit element per screen, and a
// correction the person typed four minutes ago is not it. So:
//
//	the elbow glyph   dim     furniture, like every mark this surface draws
//	                          about its own structure
//	the words         narr    ONE READING STEP BELOW THE QUESTION'S OWN
//
// The question's body is [palette.muted] (render.go's entryUser says why), and
// [palette.narr] is authored as exactly "one lightness step under the second
// voice" in the body's own hue family (styles.go). That is the step this design
// asks for, spelled with a constant that already exists — no new colour, and
// nothing that says "signal" where the fact is "the same person, still talking".
// The alternative was dim, and dim is THIS SURFACE'S OWN MURMUR: a person's
// sentence painted in the tier the notes and the hints wear would be the
// surface claiming words it did not write.
//
// AND IT IS FLUSH LEFT, in the person's own column. THE INDENT LAW (render.go's
// [app.deckRows]) is that flush-left is what was said to the person and two
// columns in is what was done on their behalf; a correction is a thing they
// said, so it stands in the same column their question stands in, with the tool
// rows it interrupted stepped in beside it.
//
// ── THE LANDING MOMENT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A steer is accepted at once and CONSUMED only when the model is actually
// given it, at the running turn's next step boundary. Those are two different
// facts about the same row and the row says both:
//
//	accepted, not yet consumed   the working idiom — the spinner every live row
//	                             on this surface turns, and the engine's own
//	                             account of where the words are landing
//	consumed                     the reading ladder's own fade: ink while it is
//	                             news, muted while it is recent, then the
//	                             settled narr forever ([hudFresh], [hudWarm])
//
// THE CLAUSE IS THE ENGINE'S SENTENCE AND NOT THIS FILE'S GUESS. Cutting the
// generation is one of three things the engine can do with a correction, and it
// says which in [session.SteerNote.Landing]: `stopped the reply here` when the
// request in flight was cut, `kept bash running as job 3` or `stopped the
// running command` when a long foreground bash was adopted or killed, and
// `waiting for the running step` when a short tool is being allowed to finish.
// A surface that drew its own word for all three would be describing a machine
// it cannot see; [steerPendingWord] is the fallback for a note that carries no
// account at all, which no session sends and a scripted event can.
//
// THE CLAUSE IS NEWS AND GOES WHEN THE NEWS DOES. It answers "what is happening
// to my words RIGHT NOW", so it is drawn while they are still waiting and is
// gone once they land — after that the block's own POSITION says where they
// landed, which is the whole of this file's design, and a clause repeating it
// forever would be furniture rather than an answer.
//
// NOTHING CLAIMS CONSUMED BEFORE [session.EventSteerConsumed]. The whole worth
// of the three events is that the surface can stop guessing, and a row that
// settled the instant somebody pressed the key would be a record of an
// intention (steer.go's [Agent.consumedSteerLocked] makes exactly this point
// about the journal).
//
// The fade reuses the status line's ramp and its two one-shot wakeups
// ([fadeTicks]) rather than a ticker, which is this surface's whole idle budget
// (effortscope.go took the same ramp for the same reason). Each block carries
// its own landing instant rather than sharing one "newest fact" record the way
// [effortMoved] does: two steers typed a step apart land at two boundaries and
// are two pieces of news, and two typed in one step land together and fade
// together, which is what actually happened.
//
// ── THE FALL-THROUGH LEAVES THE PAGE ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// A boundary is not promised. A steer still waiting when the turn ends never
// reached the model, so its block MUST NOT stay in the middle of that turn —
// the row would be this surface claiming the model read something it never saw,
// and the words are about to be drawn again a moment later as the question they
// become ([Agent.liftSteersLocked] re-homes them on the follow-up queue, and
// followup.go's [app.startFollow] draws that line like any other). Two copies
// of one sentence is the one thing this must not leave behind.
//
// So the block is WITHDRAWN, on echo.go's own rule and for echo.go's reason:
// truncated when it is last and emptied where it is not, because removing an
// entry from the middle would move every index after it and the forming rows,
// the selection and the thought marker are all held by index. An emptied block
// draws no rows at all — the layout pass drops a block with no rows before it
// gives it a row of its own — and [entryWithdrawn] is what keeps the fold and
// the answer hierarchy from reading a gap nobody can see as something that
// happened.
//
// AND A TURN THAT ENDED WITHOUT SAYING SO SWEEPS THE SAME WAY. After a person
// presses stop nothing new is drawn on this surface (app.go's [app.event]), so
// the fall-through's own event is swallowed with everything else — and a row
// left spinning inside a turn the model never carried it into would be the one
// lie this file exists to prevent. [app.settleSteers] withdraws every
// correction that never landed, at the moment the turn settles, under the same
// law: if the turn is over and the words were never consumed, they were never
// part of it.
//
// ── AND THE SAME MARK SERVES THE OTHER PAGE ────────────────────────────────
//
// A task's page is one question — the instruction the work was given — and
// everything the person says on it after that is, by the nature of the page, a
// correction to work already moving. So it is drawn with this mark too: the
// elbow where it was said, no turn opened, and on replay a correction that reads
// as a correction rather than as a second brief (docs/design/lens/DESIGN.md,
// Decision 2 and the owner's ruling 2).
//
// ONE THING IS TRUE THERE THAT IS NOT TRUE HERE, and it earns the one field this
// file added for it ([steerElbow.receipt]). A correction typed into this
// conversation is answered by the answer: the words are read by the model the
// person is already talking to, and the page keeps moving under them. A
// correction typed into a TASK crosses to ANOTHER AGENT, and there is a moment —
// sometimes a long one, when the node had parked on the pieces it handed out —
// in which nothing at all happens on the page. That silence is
// indistinguishable from the words having gone nowhere, and it is why the owner
// ruled (2026-09-01) that every task steer confirms delivery:
//
//	└ use the staging bucket, not production · delivered
//
// The sentence is the ENGINE'S, exactly as the landing clause above is
// (internal/session's [session.SteerMark.Landing] — `delivered`, or `it was
// waiting on its pieces — your line wakes it` when the line is what woke a
// parked node), because a surface that spelled its own word for a crossing it
// cannot see would be describing a machine. And it is NEWS AND GOES WHEN THE
// NEWS DOES, on this file's own ramp: the clause fades out and the elbow stays,
// so a page read back tomorrow carries the correction and not a receipt for it.
//
// ── AND A FOLD MAY NOT HIDE THEM ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The `worked` chip collapses the machinery between a question and its answer,
// and THE ONE THING ON THIS SURFACE A FOLD MAY NEVER HIDE IS THE PERSON'S OWN
// WORDS. workfold.go's [deriveWorkfolds] already ends a fold group at one of
// their messages for exactly that reason; a correction is one of their
// messages, so it ends a group too, and a corrected turn folds around the
// sentence rather than over it.

// glyphSteer is the elbow, and glyphSteerASCII is what a terminal with no
// box-drawing gets. `+` is this surface's own ASCII corner already — it is the
// first cell of [railASCII], where `╰` is the first cell of [railLast] — so a
// reader who has met one has met the other.
const (
	glyphSteer      = "└ "
	glyphSteerASCII = "+ "
)

// steerPendingWord is what an elbow says while the model has NOT been given it
// yet AND the engine sent no account of where the words are landing
// ([session.SteerNote.Landing] is the sentence it sends when it has one). It is
// the verb the engine and the person both already use for the act, and it is a
// word rather than a bare spinner because every mark on this surface has a word
// near it (docs/DESIGN-LANGUAGE.md's refusal of icon-only minimalism).
const steerPendingWord = "steering"

// steerFellWord is the honesty line, in the dim "· " lane this surface says
// everything of its own in. It states the two halves a person needs: their
// words missed the answer they were aimed at, and they were not thrown away.
const steerFellWord = "your correction came after the answer finished — asking it as a new question"

// steerElbow is one correction as the surface holds it: the words, when they
// were sent, and which of the three things happened to them.
//
// The ID is the engine's ([session.SteerNote]) and it is what pairs an outcome
// with the row the acceptance drew. It is NOT matched by text on purpose: two
// identical corrections typed a second apart are two steers, and a surface that
// paired them by their words would settle the wrong row.
type steerElbow struct {

	// landed is the instant [session.EventSteerConsumed] said the model had been
	// given these words, and the anchor the fade above is measured from. Zero
	// while the steer is still waiting for a boundary.
	landed time.Time
	// landing is the ENGINE'S OWN account of where these words are going to
	// arrive, carried on the acceptance ([session.SteerNote.Landing]): the reply
	// in flight was cut, a long bash was adopted as a job or killed, or a short
	// tool is being allowed to finish. It is the clause the row wears while it
	// waits, and it is empty on a note that carried none.
	landing string
	// receipt is the DELIVERY CLAUSE a correction wears when it crossed to
	// ANOTHER AGENT — the engine's own sentence about what the sending did
	// ([session.SteerMark.Landing]), drawn while it is news and gone when the
	// news is. See the header for the ruling it encodes.
	//
	// It is a field of its own rather than a second reading of [landing] because
	// the two answer different questions at opposite ends of the same row: the
	// landing clause says where words that have NOT yet arrived are going, and
	// this says that words that HAVE arrived did. A conversation's elbow never
	// sets it, which is what keeps the conversation's own rows exactly as they
	// were.
	//
	// A REPLAYED ELBOW CARRIES NONE. A receipt is an answer to "what is happening
	// to my words right now", and there is no right now about a correction made
	// yesterday — the block's position is what says where it went, which is the
	// whole of this file's design.
	receipt string
	// stalled says NOTHING IS HAPPENING TO THESE WORDS. It belongs to one state
	// and one only: a crossing to another agent that nobody answered, so it is
	// unknown whether the task has them (steersend.go).
	//
	// IT EXISTS TO TAKE THE SPINNER OFF. An unconsumed row spins, because an
	// unconsumed row is ordinarily a thing in flight — and a spinner over a send
	// that is not moving is this surface claiming work is happening when the
	// truth is that nobody knows anything. The clause stays instead, and it does
	// not fade: it is not news, it is an unresolved state, and it goes when the
	// send resolves and not when it gets old.
	stalled bool
	// consumed is the fact itself. It is a field beside the instant rather than
	// `!landed.IsZero()` because a REPLAYED elbow knows it landed and does not
	// know when the surface would have said so — the journal keeps the SEND's
	// instant, not the boundary's (sessionfile.go's [journalSteer]) — so a
	// replayed row is settled and unfaded, which is what a fact from yesterday is.

// starts of its own accord — the engine carries that stream across the seam so
// the person keeps one channel — so the surface has to be holding it or the
// answer to their own words arrives nowhere.
//
// [app.holdSteer] is the whole of that seam and it is one call: the door that
// sends a steer hands over the channel session gave it and forgets about it.
// The lane then does one of two things and never a third — a steer that LANDED
// is spent, so its copy of the turn is drained and dropped, and a steer that
// FELL THROUGH is a message waiting for a turn of its own, which is exactly
// what [app.follows] holds.
