// These drive the reducer directly and interleave the events by hand. That is
// the point: the race they are about is a SCHEDULING race in the engine — the
// narrator's goroutine can pass its own cancellation check and then be
// descheduled past the end of its batch — and reproducing it by timing would be
// a test that fails once a week for the wrong reason. Ordering the events is the
// same fact, stated deterministically.

// captionFeed is a reducer with no view behind it, mid-turn.
