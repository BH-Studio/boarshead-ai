// ── THE EFFORT LADDER, BOUND TO THE SURFACE A PERSON IS STANDING ON ──────────
//
// THE CONTROL BINDS TO THE SURFACE YOU STAND ON, AND ONE CHORD MOVES IT.
//
// internal/effort holds the ladder and internal/session, internal/config and
// internal/standing hold the three scopes a person can set a rung at. This file
// is the surface's half of all three, and the whole of what it decides is that
// `alt+e` means the SAME VERB everywhere and a DIFFERENT SCOPE everywhere:
//
//	the cursor on a task        the task's own rung   (session's SetTaskEffort)
//	a standing item's card      that item's rung      (standing's SetStandingEffort)
//
// A THIRD SCOPE USED TO BE HERE AND ITS SURFACE IS GONE. Home had a resting
// state — the cursor on no row at all, the column a card about the machine — and
// `alt+e` moved the INSTALL'S default from it. `↑` off the top row reaches the
// tab bar now (pages.go's [barCursor]), so there is no such card; the install's
// rung is moved from the `thinking` row of the settings panel, which is the
// writer that road went through anyway (config's WriteDefaultEffort).
//
// One chord and two scopes is not two bindings that happen to share a key.
// It is the same binding: the rung this screen is showing is the rung the chord
// moves, and a person who learns it once on a task knows it on home and on a
// standing item without being told. A second chord per scope would have been
// three things to remember for one idea, and the chord budget on this surface is
// spent (docs/DESIGN-LANGUAGE.md's refusal of keyboard speed at
// discoverability's expense — every one of the three surfaces below carries a
// visible legend naming this key beside the rung it moves).
//
// ── THE WHEEL IS THE LADDER, CHEAPEST FIRST, AND IT WRAPS ──
//
// [effortNext] walks [effort.Rungs] and comes back to the bottom off the top.
// ABSENCE IS WHERE THE WHEEL STARTS AND NOT A STOP ON IT: a scope nobody has set
// reads as nothing (the emptiness law) and the first press lands on the cheapest
// rung, but no number of further presses ever puts a rung BACK to absence.
// Clearing one is a deliberate act with real meaning — it hands the scope back
// to whatever stands above it. A standing item's rung therefore keeps this
// wheel; the three scopes the surface itself must be able to clear use
// [effortNextClearing] below.
//
// ── AND THE RUNG IS FURNITURE UNTIL IT MOVES ──
//
// On every surface below the rung is drawn as a quiet clause — `thinking high` —
// in whatever the surface's own dim tier is, because it is a standing fact about
// the thing and not news. When it MOVES, a surface that can lift the clause on
// its own steps it up the reading ladder and lets it come back down on the fade
// the status line's own numbers already use (render.go's [hudFresh] and
// [hudWarm]): ink while it is news, muted while it is recent, dim forever after.
// No new colour, no new timing constant, and no accent — the budget is one lit
// element per screen and a fact that has just changed is not it
// (docs/DESIGN-LANGUAGE.md's THE ACCENT BUDGET).
//
// HOME'S TWO CARDS CAN; THE TASK LINES CANNOT, and it is the lines and not the
// rung that decide. The room's header and the roster's telemetry row are built
// plain and painted once, whole, because a hue nested inside a hue ends at the
// inner one's reset ([app.roomHeadWord] states it). So the task scope emphasizes
// a move the way this surface has always emphasized a decision about one piece
// of work — a note in the conversation, with the rung painted as the datum in it
// (taskeffort.go's [app.cycleTaskEffort], room.go's [app.retargetTask]).
