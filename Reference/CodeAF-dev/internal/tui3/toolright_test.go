// One claim, and every test here is a corner of it: the figures a person reads
// off a tool call — is it turning, how long has it been turning, what did it
// come to — are AT THE FRAME'S EDGE, whole, at every width, and the row that
// carries them measures exactly the width it was given.
//
// The defect these were written against: every tool row is drawn two columns in
// (workfold.go's INDENT LAW) and the line was laid out to the frame's WHOLE
// width, so it overhung by two and [app.railJoin] cut it back with an ellipsis.
// A running call's `0.4s ⠋` became `0…` — a spinner that never turned, a clock
// that said nothing, and an emptiness-law violation at the edge of the screen.

// runningFetch is a surface mid-turn with one web_fetch call in flight, at a
// stated width, aged so it has a clock to draw.
