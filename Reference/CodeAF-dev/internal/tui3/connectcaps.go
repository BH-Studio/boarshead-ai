// THE CONNECTIONS TAB: the sixth page of the settings sheet, and the only one
// that is not the settings registry.
//
// /connect (connectpanel.go) is the same subject asked in a hurry — a list you
// open, act on, and leave. This is the same subject asked at rest: what have I
// connected, and what may it do for me. It lives in the settings sheet because
// that is where a person goes to change a standing answer, and a standing answer
// about somebody's mail is a setting in every sense except which file it is
// written to.

// Nine decisions, each the reason a row is shaped the way it is:
//
//   - THE ROW IS THE SETTINGS ROW. A name on the left, one fact on the right,
//     the same two-cell lead, the same selection band, the same two-line fold at
//     [tierPhone] — it is [overlayLines], which is what every list on this
//     surface is made of. The tab is a different QUESTION, not a different
//     grammar, and a person should not be able to tell where the sheet ends.
//   - AN ACCOUNT IS A BLOCK AND ITS NAME IS THE HEADING OF IT. A blank line of
//     air above each held account, the name on the row with the tick, and
//     everything the account may do INDENTED UNDER IT while it is open. It read
//     as a flat column of rows before this wave — the account and its four
//     capabilities at the same weight, one line apart — so "which of these lines
//     is a service" was a question a person had to answer by reading, on the one
//     screen whose whole job is to be scanned.
//   - A CLOSED ACCOUNT STILL SAYS WHAT IT MAY DO, in one dim line under its name
//     ([connSummary]). Auditing four accounts should not be four keystrokes and
//     four collapses: the answers are the point of the page, and a page that
//     hides all of them behind an expander is a page that has to be operated
//     before it can be read.
//   - ONE SERVICE IS OPEN AT A TIME. Expanding the second collapses the first,
//     because the column's calm is the whole reason a person can read down it —
//     and with three services expanded the capability rows outnumber the
//     accounts four to one.
//   - THE ANSWERS STAND IN ONE COLUMN. yes, ask first and off are padded to the
//     width of the longest of them, so their first letters line up under each
//     other instead of ending flush with the right edge at three different
//     places. A column of answers that a person can only read by reading is a
//     column that failed at the one thing it is for.
//   - A KEY IS GIVEN HERE. A service that wants a key opens the SAME masked box
//     /connect opens, on the row itself, with what to type above it and where to
//     find it below (connect.go's [keyBoxLines]). The tab listed those services,
//     said "enter connects", and then had nowhere to put the key — which made it
//     a page that knew the answer and would not say it.
//   - THE STATE IS A WORD AND THE WORD IS THE CONTROL. No checkbox, no bracket,
//     no [x]: `yes`, `ask first`, `off`, right-aligned where every other row on
//     this sheet puts its value, and enter walks them. A checkbox would have
//     been a third thing to draw for a state that has three positions, and a
//     bracketed widget is machinery on a row whose whole job is to be read.
//   - THE THREE WORDS ARE THREE WEIGHTS. yes is ink, ask first is muted, off is
//     dim — the typographic ladder styles.go already spends everywhere else, so
//     the column of answers can be scanned without being read. No colour: the
//     accent is spent on the tab bar, and a distinction drawn in colour on this
//     surface is drawn in text too.
//   - A CHANGE IS SAVED THE MOMENT IT IS MADE. There is no save step and no
//     pending state, because a settings sheet that holds your answer hostage to
//     a second keystroke is a sheet that loses it when you press esc. If the
//     engine refuses, the word goes back to what it was and the foot says why —
//     the sheet's own rule for a refusal (settings.go), applied to a row the
//     registry does not own.
//   - AN UNCONNECTED SERVICE CONNECTS FROM HERE. Enter starts the same sign-in
//     /connect starts — the same browser, the same waiting block in the
//     transcript, the same tick — because a tab that listed an account and then
//     sent you somewhere else to get it would be a tab that knows the answer and
//     will not say it. The row says "waiting in your browser…" while the trip is
//     out, and gains its tick, its account and its capabilities when it lands.
//   - THE CATALOG IS QUIET AND THE CURSOR IS WHERE THE DETAIL IS. Past the point
//     where the list is browsed rather than read, an available row is a name and
//     one dim word saying what enter will ask for — `key` or `sign in` — and the
//     sentence about what the service is FOR is drawn under the row a person has
//     stopped on, and under no other. Two hundred rows each carrying a sentence
//     is not a catalog, it is a wall; and the sentence is worth reading for
//     exactly one row at a time.

// tabConnections is the tab's name on the bar. It is LAST on purpose: the five
// before it are the settings registry, read five ways, and this one is not a
// registry at all. A person walking the bar left to right meets the knobs first
// and their accounts at the end, which is also the order they were asked to
// think about them in.
