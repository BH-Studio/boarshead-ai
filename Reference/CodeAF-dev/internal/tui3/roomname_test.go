// ── THE NAME REACHES THE ROW WHOLE ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A task's identity used to be cut to three words the moment it arrived
// (taskident.go's [taskTitleOf]), which is [rowfit.go]'s first law broken at the
// earliest possible moment: a fitter cannot give back cells that were spent
// before it was asked. So a hundred-and-sixty-column room header named the work
// no better than a twenty-four-cell rail row did, and a family of six pieces
// that all begin with a verb and a plural noun came out as `Cut every list`,
// `Fold the settled`, `Move the tab` on every surface at every width.
//
// These pin the fix from both ends: the name arrives whole, and each row still
// cuts it to the space that row actually has.
