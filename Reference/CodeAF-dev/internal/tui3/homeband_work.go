// THE WORK BAND: WHAT THIS CONVERSATION HAS DONE, NAME FIRST.
//
// It used to lead every row with its state — `done Port the Picker 2h`, and the
// outcome sentence jammed underneath with the next task starting immediately
// after it. A person reading that column read the word `done` eleven times
// before they read a single thing the conversation had actually done, and the
// rows ran together into one grey block because nothing separated them.
//
// So the band is turned around and given air:
//
//	Port the Picker                          2h
//	  the roster resumes cleanly · 14 files
//
//   - THE NAME IS THE ROW'S IDENTITY and it goes first, in [palette.muted]
//     rather than dim — it is the one piece of text on this band somebody is
//     scanning for. The age hangs off the right in dim, which is where every
//     other age on this surface hangs.
//   - THE NEXT LINE IS WHAT IT CAME TO, indented under the name so it reads as
//     a continuation and dim. Its sentence stays whole; file count and cost
//     move to following indented rows when the card is too narrow for them.
//   - DONE IS THE ABSENCE OF A MARK. There is no `✓` and no `done` on a landed
//     task: this surface's glyphs say what is HAPPENING, and a tick on every
//     finished row would spend the loudest ink on the rows that want nothing.
//     Everything that is NOT simply done leads the second line with its glyph
//     and its word instead — `● working`, `◌ incomplete`, `▲ your call`,
//     `✗ incomplete` — so the eye finds the exceptions and skims the rest.
//   - ONE BLANK BETWEEN TASKS AND NONE AFTER THE LAST, which is what turns the
//     band from a block into a list of things.
//
// The fold is by FAMILY and never by row ([app.bandFoldGroupsHiding]): a cut
// that fell between a task's name and its outcome would leave a sentence
// hanging under a fold line with nothing above it saying what it was about, and
// a cut that fell between a task and the work it handed out would do the same
// thing one level up — an orphan child under a fold line, with the only row that
// explains it on the other side of the cut. So a family goes behind the fold
// whole, and the count on the fold line is the pieces of work it is hiding
// rather than the families (hometree.go).

// THE ORDER THIS BAND AND THE CARD BEHIND IT DRAW A CONVERSATION'S WORK IN is
// hometree.go's, and the argument for it is worth keeping where the two readers
// can see it: WHAT WANTS A PERSON, then what is still going, then everything
// that is over — and inside each of those, the record's own order, which is
// newest first with live work counted as now (internal/session's
// [sortTaskIndex]).
//
// THE RECORD'S ORDER ALONE WAS NOT ENOUGH, AND THE FOLD IS WHY. Both readers
// show three pieces of work and fold the rest behind `▸ N more`
// ([homeWorkTasks], place_home.go's [homeCardTasks]), and the record ranks by
// WHEN. Live work sorts to the top of that because an unfinished row is dated
// now — but a task that stopped and wants somebody's look carries the moment it
// stopped, so three tasks finishing after it push the one row on the card that
// is asking for something behind a fold. The person's own instruction was that
// work needing them be easy to find, and it was findable everywhere except the
// screen they open first.
//
// IT IS RANKED BY FAMILY ([homeWorkTwigRank]), so a CHILD that is asking for
// somebody brings its parent up the band with it. A run's own name is the row
// that says what the child was for, and promoting the child alone would put the
// question on the screen with its subject folded away.
