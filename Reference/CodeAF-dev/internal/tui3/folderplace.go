// THE ROADS ONTO A FOLDER, AND THE ONE SEAM THEY ALL COME OUT OF.
//
// folderpick.go is the component; this file is everything the app does around
// it — where the candidates come from, what the third column is told, where the
// picks are kept, and what happens when somebody finally presses enter.
//
// ── THE SEAM ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every road that ends in "this directory" ends in [app.referPlace] with a
// [chosenPlace]: the picker's enter, `/attach` handed a folder, and — when the
// forming card's ground row lands — its `g`. There is ONE such method on
// purpose. Lane P2 is what makes a chosen place PERSIST (a `Places` list on the
// conversation's meta, feeding the ground ladder's SAID rung); it replaces the
// body of that one method and does not have to go and find the doors again.
// What P1 does there is real and not a placeholder: it writes the pick down for
// frecency, so the next `/folder` opens with the answer on the first row, and
// it says one dim line.

//
//   - /folder is a request to give the conversation a directory, and a
//     conversation that cannot hold one is told so instead of being handed a
//     browser it cannot choose from ([app.placeRefusal]).
//   - a bare /attach is a request to put a file on the next message, which

// THIS PACKAGE'S TEST HOME IS NOT THE MACHINE'S HOME. tui3_test.go's TestMain
// moves the state root, and says in so many words that it leaves HOME alone
// because this package draws `~` in front of paths and those readings are
// about the real one. [scanFolderRoots] does not draw `~` — it WALKS it, with
// os.UserHomeDir, which is the one thing that seam does not cover. So a test
// that opened the folder picker indexed the developer's whole home directory,
// on every run: minutes of work on a real laptop, and nothing at all on a fresh
// CI runner whose home is empty. That is a test that passes there and fails
// here, which is the shape TestMain exists to prevent.
