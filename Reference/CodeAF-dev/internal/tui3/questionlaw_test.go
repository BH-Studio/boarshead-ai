// ── THE TWO LAWS OF THE QUESTION VIEWS ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// Both are owner rulings of 2026-09-11, and both are the kind of law that is
// kept by a test or not at all: one is about a colour that is easy to reach for
// and the other is about a ladder that is easy to grow an `if` on.

// COLOUR IS STROKE AND NEVER FILL: NO ROW OF A QUESTION IS PAINTED IN THE
// QUESTION HUE (colour pick C).
//
// The amber belongs to the three marks — `?`, the pointer `▸`, the recommended
// `◆` — and to the keys' own payload hue. Every word on a question is ordinary
// ink, every aside dim, the frame's edge dim, and the row the pointer stands on
// takes the GROUND ladder's `selected` rather than a colour of its own. A row
// painted amber is a row shouting the one thing the marks already say, and the
// block spent a year doing it: `a.pal.ask(head)`, `askBold` on every answer's
// key, the whole offer row in the question hue.
