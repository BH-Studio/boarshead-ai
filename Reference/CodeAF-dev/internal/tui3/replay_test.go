// THE DEFECT THESE TESTS PIN: a resumed conversation drew its tool calls as
// lines that expanded into nothing. The rows came from the journal, the journal
// held every byte of the arguments and the results, and the entries the surface
// was handed carried neither — so clicking a replayed write showed a blank where
// the content was.
//
// The acceptance is therefore not "the payload arrived" but "the replayed row is
// the live row": the same expansion, from the same renderer, off the same two
// fields.
