// THE REASONING LEVEL IS A FACT THIS SURFACE HOLDS, NOT A QUESTION IT ASKS
// WHILE DRAWING.
//
// ── THE DEFECT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The status row spells the level onto the model segment
// (view.go's [app.statusRow]), the picker spells it onto every row it lists
// (palette.go), and the settings sheet spells it onto its own. All three read
// it through [app.reasoningFor], and until this file existed that method asked
// THE AGENT, on the draw path, once per reader per frame.
//
// At home that is a map read under the session's mutex and costs nothing worth
// a name. Over `--host` the agent is a handle on another machine
// (internal/remote's Agent.ReasoningFor) and the same line is a ROUND TRIP DOWN
// AN SSH PIPE, with a ten-second deadline on it. Measured over a loopback
// client before this file was written:
//
//	100 frames                        100 far calls — one per frame
//	200 pointer motions over the foot  200 far calls — one per MOTION EVENT,
//	                                   because a hover below the conversation
//	                                   rebuilds the chrome to find out what row
//	                                   it is on (view.go's [app.chromeAt])
//	one frame with /model open          13 far calls — one per visible row
//
// A pointer crossing the bottom of the window sends one motion per cell, and
// every one of them put a synchronous round trip in front of the update loop.
// That is the whole of "even hover seems to slow everything down": the loop was
// not slow at painting, it was waiting on the network once per cell, and every
// key and click behind it in the queue waited too.
//
// ── THE RULE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// NOTHING ON THE DRAW PATH TOUCHES THE AGENT. [app.reasoningFor] answers from
// [app.levels] and from nowhere else. A level this surface has not been told
// about yet is queued ([app.wantLevel]) and answered as no level at all, which
// is what the emptiness law already draws as nothing; the frame clock asks the
// agent off the loop ([app.levelKick]) and the answer lands as a message, one
// frame later, exactly as the far machine's file facts do (remotefiles.go,
// whose shape this follows deliberately).
//
// AND THE MOMENTS THAT CANNOT AFFORD TO BE A FRAME LATE ARE SEEDED DIRECTLY,
// because each is already a place where the surface talks to the agent and a
// person is waiting: the session opening ([newApp]), a model switch
// ([app.switchModel]), a conversation being attached ([app.attachConversation]),
// and the first ctrl+t against a row nobody has asked about ([app.cycleReasoning],
// whose cycle is relative and so cannot start from "not told yet"). So the status
// row names the level on its FIRST frame and not its second.
//
// A LEVEL THIS SURFACE SET IS NEVER ASKED ABOUT AT ALL. ctrl+t writes through
// ([app.cycleReasoning]), so the picker row under the cursor changes on the very
// next frame at home and over a connection alike — the one thing a cache in
// front of a knob must not get wrong.
//
// ── AND THE WHOLE TABLE ARRIVES AT ONCE WHERE THE ENGINE CAN SEND IT ────────
//
// The one-at-a-time asks above are the FALLBACK. An agent that can hand over
// every level it holds in one answer ([levelSource]) is asked for all of them at
// the moments this surface already talks to it — the session opening, a
// conversation being attached, a model switch, and every turn end — and the
// table is COMPLETE from the first frame rather than a frame behind the first
// row that needed a level. Nothing is queued, because nothing is unknown.
//
// Over a connection that answer is free: internal/remote's Agent reads it out of
// the replica the engine keeps fresh by push (replica.go), so the table is fed
// rather than filled and this surface never asks the far machine about a level
// at all. At home it is one copy of a small map under the session's own lock,
// once a turn.
//
// ── WHAT IT CAN BE WRONG ABOUT, SAID OUT LOUD ───────────────────────────────
//
// Between two of those moments the table is a photograph. A level dialled on
// ANOTHER window attached to the same hosted session reaches this one at the end
// of the next turn — the engine states its facts there — and not the instant it
// changes. That is the whole of the bound. An agent with no bulk door keeps the
// older bound: a level it was never asked about is asked for once and then kept
// for the life of the agent.
//
// The three doors that change a level HERE — this surface's own ctrl+t,
// `--reasoning` at launch (which the door sets before [newApp] reads it), and a
// model switch — are all seeded or written through above, so nothing a person
// does on this screen is ever a frame late.

// levelSource is an agent that can hand over every level it holds in one
// answer. It is asserted rather than added to [Agent] on [effortDialer]'s terms:
// a method on that interface is a method thirty test doubles have to grow, and a
// session that cannot answer it simply falls back to the one-at-a-time asks
// above — which is the whole reason those are kept.
type levelSource interface {
	ReasoningLevels() map[string]string

// levelsSeed replaces the table with everything the agent holds, and reports
// whether it could. It is called from the moments this surface already speaks to
// the agent and never from a draw.
//
// IT REPLACES RATHER THAN MERGES, because the answer is the whole truth: a level
// this table holds and the agent does not is a level somebody cycled back to off
// on another window, and merging would keep it standing for ever.
