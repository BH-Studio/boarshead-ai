// /files: THE THINGS THAT WERE MADE FOR YOU, AND WHERE THEY WENT.
//
// A conversation produces files — a generated picture, an exported document,
// a report written into a session that owns its own workspace — and every one
// of them lands at a path that scrolled off the screen an hour ago. "The
// report from Tuesday" is then a question nobody can answer without knowing
// which directory that conversation was about, which is the question this list
// exists to remove (docs/CHAT-V3.md, Decision 26).
//
// It reads the GLOBAL index and not a directory, and that is the whole of why
// it is worth having: what was made lives in as many places as there were
// conversations, and the index is the one file that knows all of them
// (internal/session's artifacts.go). The rows are citations — a title, a kind,
// a path and when it landed — so this list costs one small file read and one
// stat per row, and never a walk.
//
// Four decisions, and three of them are borrowed rather than invented:
//
//   - IT IS THE PICKER GESTURE, unchanged (palette.go, resume.go): a filter box
//     in the input line's place, a short list under it, ↑↓ to move, esc to leave
//     everything as it was. A second list with its own manners would be a second
//     thing to learn for a question of the same shape.
//   - TWO GLYPHS AND A NAME. A picture is marked differently from everything
//     else because it is the one deliverable that is not words; the dim tail
//     carries where it went and how long ago, which are the two facts a person
//     is comparing rows on.
//   - A FILE THAT IS GONE SAYS SO AND OFFERS NOTHING. The index is append-only
//     and a person may delete, move or rename anything in it at any time, so a
//     row is checked against the disk when the list opens. A row that no longer
//     names a file keeps its place — "I did make that, and it is not there any
//     more" is the answer somebody is looking for — and every verb steps over
//     it. Removing the row instead would answer the question with silence.
//   - IT NEVER OPENS ON NOTHING. A person who has made nothing gets one
//     sentence and no overlay, for [openResume]'s reason: a modal list with no
//     rows is a trap that has to be dismissed before it can be told it was
//     useless.
//
// THE VERBS ARE CHORDS AND NOT BARE LETTERS, which is the one place this list
// departs from the shape it was drawn from, and it is forced by the filter. A
// list that is typed into gives every plain letter to the box — /connect's
// panel states that law — so a bare "r" on a list a person filters by typing
// "report" would reveal a file on the way to finding it. The model picker
// already spends a chord on its second verb for the same reason (ctrl+t, the
// reasoning effort), so these follow it: ctrl+r reveals and ctrl+y copies,
// where "yank" is what this surface already calls taking a copy of something
// (copymode.go).

// filesRows is how many deliverables are on offer at once. It is the resume
// picker's ten and not the model picker's twelve, for that list's reason: a row
// here carries a title somebody wrote a sentence into, where a model row
// carries an id.
const filesRows = 10

// filesKept is how many rows of the index this list reads back. The file holds
// everything ever made and is capped in the thousands (internal/session's
// artifactRows); two hundred is far past what a person scrolls or filters down
// and is the bound on the stats — one per row, on the keystroke that opens the
// list.
