// of the surface a person spends most of their time on: the conversation. And
// the manual promises them there in as many words — home.md says `alt+1` "goes
// straight there from anywhere", places.md tables the seven as "jump straight to
// a place" — so a chord that did nothing at all on the conversation was the
// program contradicting its own account of itself.

// conversationApp is a surface with the places available and NOTHING drawn over
// the transcript. There is no page id for that state — [app.page] is a label on
// whichever place was last standing — so what says it is [app.pageShowing],
// which asks the places' own `open` flags.

// that neither arrow is a tab key, and what `→` is instead is the strip.
