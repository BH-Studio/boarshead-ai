// THE SHELL LEXER, AND WHY IT IS A LEXER AND NOT A PARSER.
//
// A bash row is the one tool line on this surface whose target is a LANGUAGE.
// Every other target is a noun — a path, a pattern — and one ink tier says
// everything there is to say about it. A command is a sentence: it has a verb,
// it has quoted text, it has switches, it has places, and it has the operators
// that join two commands into one. Painted in a single tier it reads as a wall,
// and the whole point of opening a bash row is to read the command.
//
//	╰─▶ bash cd /tmp && echo "hi" | grep -n x # note
//	│ cd /tmp && echo "hi" | grep -n x # note
//	│ ─┬ ──┬─ ─┬ ──┬─ ──┬─ ─┬── ─┬ ┬  └── comment  dim

//
// It is a LEXER — one left-to-right pass, no grammar, no state beyond "is the
// next word in command position" — and that is a ceiling, not a shortcut. A
// parser would have to decide what `$(…)` returns and whether `{` opened a
// block or a brace expansion, and every one of those decisions is a chance to
// paint a command as something it is not. The rules below are all SHAPE rules,
// each one true of every shell anybody runs, and the failure mode of every one
// of them is a token painted plain — which is what the whole line looked like
// before this file existed.
//
// What it deliberately does not do:
//
//   - it does not follow a quote across a newline. Each line is lexed on its
//     own (see [shellLines]) so that a multi-line command's rows can be
//     highlighted independently, which is what lets the expansion wrap without
//     re-lexing; a heredoc body is therefore lexed as ordinary words.
//   - it does not know your $PATH. A word in command position is a command
//     whether or not it exists, because the surface is describing what was RUN,
//     not what would have worked.
//   - it does not expand anything. `$HOME/x` is a path because it has a slash
//     in it, and `$HOME` alone is plain.

// shellKind is one token's role, and the paint follows from it directly.
