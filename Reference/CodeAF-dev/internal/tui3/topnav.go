//
// The first row of every frame is the product's name, the places a person can
// go, and the machine's pulse on the far end (pulse.go). It is drawn by ONE
// function ([app.navLine]) for a place, a conversation, a room inside one and
// the grid of open tabs, so the words are in the same cells whichever page is
// up and a hand that learned where `spend` is finds it there everywhere.
//
// ── THE LAWS ──
//
//   - THE PLACE YOU ARE IN IS LIT IN THE ONE ACCENT and every other word is
//     muted. Inside a conversation, or on the grid of its tabs, the place is
//     `chats` ([app.navLit]): the strip under the nav is the chats, so the word
//     that names them is the one lit over it.
//   - EVERY WORD IS A WORD BUTTON: a one-cell pad either side, a ground under
//     the pointer that covers the pads too, and a press anywhere on that ground
//     goes to the place ([app.navPress]). The pad cells are the target because
//     they are drawn as the button; a one-cell miss beside a word is a miss
//     people make. Where colour cannot show a ground, the pointer's word wears
//     the linear mark `·` in its leading pad, as the strip's tabs do.
//   - THE HINT LINE SAYS WHAT A WORD OPENS AND ITS KEY while the pointer rests
//     on it ([app.headHint]), so a word is never a lone label a person has to
//     press to learn about.
//   - THE GAPS ARE FIXED. One cell of inset at each end of the row, [navLead]
//     cells between the wordmark and the first button, no cells between two
//     buttons (their pads are the air, two blank cells between two words), and
//     at least [navTailGap] cells before the pulse. None of them changes with
//     the width; what a narrow row gives up is words and clauses, never air.
//
// ── THE WIDTH LADDER ──
//
// A row too narrow for everything gives things up IN THE OWNER'S ORDER
// (2026-09-24): the clock goes first (and the machine's name with it, the
// other fact every terminal title already carries), then the moving count,
// then the words of `2 want you`, which shortens to `2 ?` in the same amber,
// then the allowance behind the day's figure, and only then do the trailing
// places fold into `more ▾`, one word at a time from the right. The day's
// figure goes after every place has folded, and THE COUNT THAT WANTS YOU
// NEVER GOES: it is the one thing on this row a person must not have to go
// looking for, so it outlasts the money and the places (pulse.go).
// The wordmark, the place you are in and the word under the bar's cursor
// never fold, and a place wearing a count keeps its word, because a number is
// this row saying something moved in a room you are not in.
//
// `more ▾` IS A DOOR: a press opens a small menu of exactly the places it
// folded (navmore.go), so a narrow row still reaches every place by pointer as
// well as by `alt+N`.

// navRow is the row of the frame the nav is drawn on, the first, over the
// strip. The frame records that it drew one in [app.tabRow], which is -1 on a
// frame with no head at all.

// head: the spacing between the places' row and the strip or rule under it
// (head.go).

// and over the rule, and only while a conversation is in front (head.go).

	// tells the product's name from the first word a person can press.
