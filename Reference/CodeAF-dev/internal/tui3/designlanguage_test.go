//     the time; a live tier that arrived there would have restored the defect and
//     merely renamed it "the streaming text".
//   - THE STEP. Live is defined as ONE step above the body, and adaptive.go's
//     [liveStep] is where that step's width is written down. Holding the authored
//     pairs inside it is what stops a future retune from buying the effect by
//     widening the gap — a leap is not a step, and a leap that started under the
//     ceiling would still end over it the first time the ink came down.

// Both ladders are walked, because the light one travels the other way: on a page
// a growing edge leads by being DARKER, so the step is measured as a ratio of
// contrasts and the arithmetic is the same in both directions.

//     it is the one escape styles.go's own underline note excepts by name, and a
//     terminal that cannot follow one simply shows the text.
//   - THE FRAME IS STILL THE WHOLE FRAME. The layout may not depend on a paint:
//     if a row's width came from a padded background rather than from its text,
//     the count below moves.
//   - THE PLACE STILL SAYS WHERE YOU ARE. The tab bar's band is a colour and is
//     gone, so the place's own word had better still be on the screen — this is
