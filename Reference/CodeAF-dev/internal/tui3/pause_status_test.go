// A RUN HELD AT ITS FUEL GATE STOPS CLAIMING TO BE WORKING.
//
// The ⏸ and the fold's loudest rank were already written for a fact this surface
// could not be told: nothing on a task notice said a run was standing at its
// gate, so a run that had spent its tank and was waiting to be topped up drew a
// turning spinner and filed itself under work in flight. The engine publishes it
// now (session's TaskNotice.Paused, stamped on the run's own row), and these are
// what the column, the strip and the counts do with it.
