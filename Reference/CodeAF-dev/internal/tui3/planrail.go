// planrail.go draws A RUN'S TASKS THE WAY EVERY OTHER TASK IS DRAWN.
//
// A run's parts are rows of its plan store and not nodes of this window's graph,
// and for a while they had a renderer of their own: a still half-circle where
// every other working row has the spinner, no handle, no clock and price line,
// and the finished parts of a family folded into one `✓ N done` count. Two
// shapes for one kind of thing is a column a person has to learn twice, and the
// owner's ruling on it was plain — every task looks the same.
//
// SO THERE IS ONE RENDERER AND THIS FILE IS ITS ADAPTER. A store row is lent a
// [taskNode] ([planRailNode]) carrying only what the store knows — its title,
// its state, when it started, what it has cost, and the step it is running —
// and that node is drawn by [app.railEntryRow], the function every node row on
// the side column is drawn by: one line, its glyph, its name and its time. A figure the store does not keep, such as tokens or
// the model, is left unset, and the renderer's emptiness law draws nothing for
// it rather than a zero.
