// THE BOX BELONGS TO WHOEVER IT IS TALKING TO.
//
// There is one editor on this surface and there always has been: the same `› `
// under the conversation is the one a room steers a node with (room.go's header
// says so in as many words, and it is the right design — a person types into one
// box and learns one set of keys). What was missing is WHOSE WORDS ARE IN IT.
//
// A window with a half-written sentence to the model, a click on a task's row and
// one enter sent that sentence to the task. The box never changed, so the words
// never changed, and the only thing that moved was where enter pointed — which is
// the worst possible shape for this failure: nothing on screen was wrong, and a
// message the person had written for one reader was read by another.
//
// So the box is a VIEW onto one recipient's composer, and every recipient owns
// its own:
//
//	main            the conversation — the sentence for the model
//	task 7          the line you are steering into that node
//	an adaptive run the line the planner reads on its next call
//
// Opening a page stashes what the box was holding under the recipient it was
// holding it FOR, and lays out that page's own — its text, its caret, its compact
// paste chips and its attachment tray. Escape puts the first one back exactly.
// Nothing is ever carried across: a draft that has not been sent has not changed
// its mind about who it is for.
//
// ── WHERE THE STASH LIVES ──
//
// In this window while it is open, in the keeper when the conversation is put
// down (detach.go's [aside]), and ON DISK either way: every recipient's composer
// is written into this conversation's own record and read back to the same
// recipient of the same conversation (draftkeep.go). What is read off the SCREEN
// is nothing — the file is written from here, through [app.mainComposer] and
// [app.everyComposer], because a line typed into a task's page is otherwise the
// line the crash file keeps and the next launch pastes a message for a worker
// into the conversation.

// recipient names one reader of the box. Its zero value is the conversation
// itself, which is what makes "who has the box" answerable before anything has
// been opened.
//
// A NODE AND A RUN ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF READER AND NEVER COLLIDE. A run's page
// is built with the node id zero on purpose (roomorch.go), so keying a run by its
// id STRING rather than by that zero is what keeps its draft out of the
// conversation's slot.
type recipient struct {
	task uint64
	run  string
	// guest is the OTHER conversation a page belongs to, and it is empty for
	// every page of this one.
	//
	// IT IS THE HOOK FOR A READ-ONLY PAGE ONTO SOMEBODY ELSE'S WORK. Navigation
	// opens a task page whose rows come from another conversation's journal, and
	// `task 7` there is not this conversation's task 7: one number, two pieces of
	// work, and a shared slot would be the misdelivery this file exists to end
	// with a page in between. The lane that opens such a page calls
	// [guestRecipient] with the session that page is reading, and everything else
	// — the stash, the record, the reunion — already keys on it.
	guest string
	// start says this is THE NEW-CHAT START PAGE's own box, and it is the one
	// recipient on this list that is not a reader of any conversation at all.
	//
	// IT IS A RECIPIENT SO THAT `+` COSTS NOTHING TO GET RIGHT. The start page
	// puts a blank composer in front of somebody while the conversation they were
	// in is still on the other side of an escape, and every hazard in that
	// sentence — their half-written message, its caret, the screenshot on its
	// tray, the documents behind its compact tokens — is exactly what this file
	// already carries from one reader to another and back untouched. A second
	// stash written for the start page would be a second answer to "what is the
	// box holding", kept in step with this one by nothing.
	//
	// IT BELONGS TO THE WINDOW AND NEVER TO A CONVERSATION, which is the one law
	// that is its own rather than inherited: nobody has been addressed yet, so
	// there is no conversation whose record these words could go down under. It is
	// kept out of the aside and out of the crash file for that reason
	// (draftkeep.go's [app.everyComposer] states it where the two readings are
	// taken), and a start page left parked keeps its words on the surface itself
	// (chatstart.go's [app.startKept]).

// ── THE OUTBOX SEAM ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A send is not a keystroke: the words leave the box, cross to another machine,
// and are answered later or not at all. The lane that owns that crossing owns
// the transport, the identity it mints and every word drawn about it; what it
// needs from HERE is the one thing this file is about — somewhere to put a
// person's sentence that belongs to the recipient it was typed at.
//
// So this is the whole interface, and it is deliberately four small functions:
//
//	[app.keepSend]       a message has left this recipient's box and not settled.
//	                     Written down under its own durable name, so a restart
//	                     can ask again as the SAME message rather than a second
//	                     one (draftkeep.go).
//	[app.dropSend]       it settled. Forget it.
//	[app.recoverDraft]   it failed, or nobody answered. Give the words back to
//	                     the recipient they were typed at.
//	[app.takeRecovered]  the words that were given back, for a page that is
//	                     drawing itself.
//
// AND THE ONE RULE [app.recoverDraft] KEEPS, which is the contract the sending
// lane relies on and the reason it is here rather than there:
//
//   - the sentence goes to the recipient it was typed at and to no other, open
//     page or not;
//   - a draft the person has typed since is NEVER overwritten — the recovered
//     words wait beside it instead, and are offered the next time that
//     recipient's box is empty;
//   - it is spelled as they typed it, compact tags and all, with the documents
//     behind them.

// The four states a written-down send can be in. They are STORAGE WORDS and are
// never drawn: what a person reads about a crossing is the engine's own
// sentence, which is the sending lane's law and not this file's.
//
// THREE OF THEM ARE SENDS AND ONE IS A DRAFT, and that line is the whole reason
// there are four. A send nobody answered may already be on the node's record, so
// putting its words back in the box would let the next enter mint a new name for
// them and deliver the correction twice; a send the engine READ AND REFUSED
// wrote nothing anywhere, so the words are the person's again. Both used to wear
// [draftSendUnanswered], which made the second indistinguishable from the first
// and the first offerable as a plain draft.
