// ── WHAT A TAB IS ALLOWED TO SAY ABOUT ITS CONVERSATION ─────────────────────
//
// The tab strip's own law is that a tab is a conversation this window has been
// in, and NOT a promise that it is running (chattabs.go). This file is the
// narrowest possible widening of that: one mark, three states, and every one of
// them read off something this process already knows for certain.
//
// ── THE TWO READINGS THAT ARE FORBIDDEN, AND WHY ────────────────────────────
//
// [session.Agent.TaskIndex] READS A FILE. It is how the switcher counts running
// work, and the switcher is drawn on a keystroke; the strip is laid out on every
// frame, so the same reading here would be a disk scan per tab per frame — or,
// over `--host`, a call to another machine (keeper.go's [behindWatch] states the
// same law from the other end).
//
// [session.Agent.NeedsPerson] TAKES THE AGENT'S MUTEX AND ALLOCATES A MAP
// (session's taskpresence.go). It is cheap once and it is not cheap eight times
// a frame, and it can block behind a turn that is holding the lock.
//
// So the far side's two facts are CACHED BY THE WATCHER THAT WAS ALREADY
// WATCHING, at the transitions it was already computing (keeper.go's
// [behindWatch.waits] and [behindWatch.turning]), and reading them here is two
// atomic loads per tab. The near side's question is cached the same way, by the
// loop after each message ([app.frontWaits]), and its work is read off the
// surface itself.
//
// ── WHAT COUNTS AS NEEDING A PERSON ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A QUESTION SOMEBODY HAS TO ANSWER, and nothing else. The engine's own
// definition is the list in [session.Agent.waitingOnPerson] — a consent card, a
// sign-in, a subharness offer, a task proposal WITH NO DEADLINE, a run out of
// fuel — and the exclusion in it is the one that matters here: an automatic
// proposal carrying a deadline is a countdown, which proceeds whether or not
// anybody looks at it, and is not a request.
//
// The front tab reads THE SAME PREDICATE, asked on the loop once per message
// rather than by the frame ([app.frontWaits]), with the cards already on its own
// screen beside it. It used to read the surface alone, which counted a consent
// card and a waiting proposal and none of a landed `your call`, the model's own
// blocking question or a sub-harness's, so a `?` on the tab beside went away
// the moment that conversation came forward (#1316). INTERNAL
// WAITS ARE NOT ON EITHER LIST. A tool checking something, a node waiting on a
// dependency, a provider being retried — all of those are WORK, and a strip that
// spelled them `?` would put an amber question mark on every tab at once and
// teach a person to ignore the one that means them.
//
// ── AND WORK IS NOT ONLY THE TURN ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A TASK OUTLIVES THE TURN THAT PROPOSED IT. The node runs in its own worktree
// under its own agent; the conversation's turn ends the moment the proposal is
// answered, and the work goes on for minutes after that. So a strip that asked
// only whether a turn was in flight drew the busiest conversation in the window
// at rest — which is the reading this file used to have, and the one it does
// not have now.
//
// Both sides answer that from something already in memory. The conversation in
// front reads its OWN ROSTER ([app.taskSeen], the last state seen per node,
// which task.go keeps for the de-dup); a held one reads the watcher's cached
// fold of the same notices (keeper.go's [behindWatch.tasking]). Neither opens
// [session.Agent.TaskIndex], which reads a file.
//
// IT IS THE WORKING MARK AND NEVER THE QUESTION, on both sides. A queued node
// waiting on a dependency and a running one are the same thing to a person —
// something is happening and nobody is being asked — and an UNVERIFIED node,
// which really is waiting on a decision, is deliberately not raised as one
// either: the engine's own list of what needs a person does not carry it
// (session's [Agent.waitingOnPerson]), and the strip does not get to disagree
// with the engine about what a question is.
//
// ── AND WHAT IDLE LOOKS LIKE ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Nothing. The emptiness law: unknown or at rest draws no mark, never a dot and
// never a dimmed placeholder. There is no clock here either — the marks change
// when a stir wakes the surface (keeper.go) or when the conversation in front
// changes state, both of which already paint a frame.

// tabSignal is what one conversation is doing, as far as this window can
// honestly say. Its zero value is the honest answer for a conversation nothing
// is known about.
type tabSignal uint8

const (
	// tabIdle is at rest, or not known. The two are one state on purpose: this
	// window cannot tell them apart for a conversation it is only remembering,
	// and a mark that meant "probably" would be the strip inventing a claim.
	tabIdle tabSignal = iota

//
// IT IS THE ONE READING OF A HELD CONVERSATION'S STATE. The strip draws it on

// surfaces cannot answer the same question differently on one frame. The

//
// IT IS SEPARATE FROM [behindWatch.signal] BECAUSE A QUESTION OUTRANKS WORK ON
