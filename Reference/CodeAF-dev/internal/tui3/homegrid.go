// ── THE GRID ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// HOME IS A FIXED SET OF PANELS, EACH ANSWERING ONE QUESTION A PERSON HAS WHEN
// THEY WALK UP TO A COLLEAGUE'S DESK (docs/design/home-mission-control/DESIGN.md
// §1). The chat list is one of them. This file is the arrangement: which panel
// stands in which column at which width, how a short terminal gives way, and
// what an empty panel says. What each panel HOLDS is its own file
// (homepanel_<name>.go), and every one of them is a pure reading over what home
// already cached on its three-second beat — a panel opens nothing, stats
// nothing and asks no seam, which is what keeps the place law "a place never
// reads the disk on a draw" true of a screen made of seven readings.
//
// THE LAYOUT IS DECIDED WHEN THE LINES ARE BUILT, NOT WHEN THEY ARE PAINTED. A
// squeezed panel keeps its heading and `N more · <place>`, so which rows exist
// depends on the room — and the cursor may only ever stand on a row that is on
// the screen. So the column count and the height reach [homeView.buildGrid]
// exactly the way the height already reached the switcher before it
// ([placeHome.body] rebuilds when either moves), and the paint only lays the
// columns side by side.
//
// EVERY ROW IS A LINE OF HOME'S OWN COLUMN. A conversation on any panel is a
// [homeSession] line, a watch is a [homeItem] line, a door into a place is a
// [homeLedger] line — so enter, the verbs, the digits, the takeover and the row
// identity every other part of this screen already asks of a line go on
// working unchanged. What a panel adds is [homeLine.cell]: the words the row is
// painted with.

// a hundred and seventy, three past it.
