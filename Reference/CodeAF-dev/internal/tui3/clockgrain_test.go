// ── ONE GRAIN OF CLOCK ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A task's row said `42m` and the page it opened said `ran 6m 0s`, so the same
// clock changed grain across one keypress — and four of those cells were spent
// on a zero the emptiness law would strike anywhere else on the surface
// (docs/design/polish/audit-tasks.md row 17). [reltime.Elapsed] already states
// the rule for the settled figure; this is the live one saying it too.
