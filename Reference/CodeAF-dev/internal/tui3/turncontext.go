// THE TURN SAYS WHAT IT IS PART OF.
//
// Nearly every sentence a person types on this surface is a message to a
// conversation, and that is so ordinary it needs no saying. A few are not. A
// line typed at a subharness being designed goes into that design's own thread,
// where it can rewrite the page — and the transcript drew it exactly as it draws
// an ordinary chat turn: the accent `›`, a think, an answer. "use models
// dynamically in the subharness", typed at a design and acted on by it, read back
// as a remark made to nobody in particular. Somebody scrolling their own history
// had no way to learn that those five words had built something.
//
// So:
//
//	THE LAW — A TURN THAT RUNS INSIDE A NAMED WORKING CONTEXT NAMES THAT CONTEXT
//	WHERE THE TURN STARTS, AND THE NAME IS READ OFF THE SESSION'S REAL STATE.
//
// Three things follow from it, and they are the whole of this file:
//
//   - THE NAME COMES FROM THE ENGINE AND IS DRAWN VERBATIM. It is the word the
//     node itself published for what it is (session's TaskNotice.Context —
//     "designing subharness flake-triage"), taken off the node the engine
//     actually routed the turn into. Nothing here recognizes a shape, matches a
//     kind, or reads the person's own words: a surface that inferred the context
//     from the text would be guessing about the one fact the person needs to be
//     certain of, and a surface holding a list of contexts would be a second
//     place for that list to drift from the engine's.
//   - IT IS FROZEN ON THE BLOCK AT SUBMIT TIME ([entry.context]). Where a
//     sentence went is a fact about the past; asking the live session would
//     re-label a whole history the moment somebody walked into a different room.
//   - AN ORDINARY TURN DRAWS NOTHING AT ALL. Not a dim placeholder, not an empty
//     clause — nothing (docs/DESIGN-LANGUAGE.md's emptiness law). The mark
//     appears because there is something to report, and its appearing is the
//     report.
//
// ── THE FORM, AND WHY IT IS THIS ONE ──

//
// A DIM CLAUSE ON THE PERSON'S OWN LINE. Four decisions, each of them a rule this
// surface already keeps rather than a choice made here:
//
//   - IT HAS WORDS AND IT IS NOT A GLYPH. Every mark on this surface has a word
//     near it, because an unfamiliar glyph is indistinguishable from a decorative
//     one (docs/DESIGN-LANGUAGE.md's refusal of icon-only minimalism).
//   - IT DOES NOT SPEND THE ACCENT. The accent marks the one live or chosen thing
//     on a screen, and a fact about where a sentence went is not it — a passing
//     line never gets the budget (the payload rule says exactly this).
//   - IT IS A CLAUSE AND NOT A ROW. ` · ` is the spacing ladder's clause step:
//     parts of one sentence on one line. A row above every turn would be a row
//     taken off the transcript for a fact eighteen cells can carry, which is the
//     argument the composer's own room segment is built on (room.go).
//   - AND IT WRAPS RATHER THAN BEING CUT, onto the continuation lead the block
//     already uses, because a context truncated mid-word is the one place a
//     shortened sentence could name the wrong design.
//
// ── WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO ──
//
// It does not announce the context a second time on the same frame. A design's
// room already carries the node in its pinned header and in the segment in front
// of the composer's caret, and the conversation already draws the dim
// `⠿ harness · designing with <model> · <goal> — task 4` row when a design opens
// and its settle card when one lands (harness.go, taskdone.go). This is the one
// account of it that is part of the TRANSCRIPT — the thing that scrolls, exports
// and is read back tomorrow — and the chrome around it is left exactly as it was.

// turnContextSep is the clause that joins the mark to the sentence in front of
// it: the spacing ladder's own divider, spelled the way every other clause on
// this surface is spelled.
const turnContextSep = " · "

// turnContextLead is what the mark opens with when it did not fit on the line it
// belongs to. It is the continuation lead the person's own block already wraps
// onto, so a mark on its own row sits under the sentence rather than under the
// glyph.
const turnContextLead = "  "

// turnContextFloor is the least width worth drawing a mark in. Under it the
// block is already fighting for room to hold the person's own words, and a
// context clipped to five cells names nothing.
const turnContextFloor = 12

// turnContext is the named working context THIS surface's next turn will run

// IT ASKS THE SESSION'S REAL STATE AND NOTHING ELSE. The room open on this
// surface names the node the engine will route the words to (room.go's
// [app.steer] hands them to that same id), and the node carries the word the
// engine published for what it is. A room the surface has had no update about

// this room reads it from. Every one of these lines was typed into THIS node, so
