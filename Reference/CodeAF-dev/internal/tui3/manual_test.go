// THE MANUAL IS A BUILD ARTEFACT, NOT A DOCUMENT SOMEBODY REMEMBERS TO UPDATE.

// The chat answers "what can you do?" out of internal/manual's chat/ pages, and
// the whole value of that arrangement is that the answer cannot drift from the
// program. A command added to the table without a line in a page would make the
// chat confidently deny having a feature it ships — the exact failure the pages
// exist to prevent, and one nobody would notice until a user hit it. So the
// table is checked against the pages here, and the build fails first.
//
// The bar is deliberately low — the page must MENTION the command, not describe
// it well. A test that graded prose would be a test nobody could keep green;
// this one only insists that whoever added the feature also opened the manual.

	// ── `alt+1`, `alt+2` AND `alt+3` WERE ON THIS LIST AND WERE TAKEN OFF ─────
	//
	// They were banned because they were the RESIDENT's place keys and the chat
	// had no such thing — so a chat page spelling one could only be a page that
	// had drifted into the wrong product's vocabulary. The places wave (pages.go)
	// binds `alt+1` … `alt+7` in the chat itself, as the jump to each of the seven
	// places, which means the ban stopped being a fact about this product and
	// became a stale rule forcing the manual to lie: CLAUDE.md requires every new
	// key to be documented, and the only way to document these three while the
	// ban stood was to describe the class and quietly omit its first three
	// members — which is exactly the "named in a section that denies it" failure
	// the manual law warns about.
	//
	// So the three strings are gone and NOTHING ELSE IS. The phrases left are the
	// ones that are still resident-only, and `alt+4` … `alt+7` were never on the
	// list in the first place. If a later wave gives the chat a board or a self
	// page, the same reasoning applies to that word and to no other.
