// REPLAY ON RESUME: a resumed conversation opens showing itself.
//
// A session that is picked up rather than created has a transcript the model
// can see and the person cannot, and a surface that opened on an empty screen
// would be asking somebody to hold in their head the thing it is holding on
// disk. So the tail is drawn — in the SAME shapes the live surface draws, from
// the same renderers, because two renderings of one conversation is how a
// replayed screen starts lying about what happened.
//
// THE SAME SHAPES MEANS THE SAME PAYLOAD. A replayed call used to be a line and
// nothing else: the entries carried a gloss, so clicking one opened an expansion
// with nothing in it — the write whose content was the reason to click, gone.
// The journal had it all along (the arguments ride the assistant message's
// tool_calls, the result is the tool message keyed by the same id), so
// [session.DisplayEntry] now carries both and a replayed row expands to the real
// thing: a write to its content, an edit to its diff, a bash to its output.
//
// What is still NOT redrawn is as deliberate: no spinners, no costs, no
// reasoning. A replayed call is a call that finished, and it is drawn quiet.
//
// And a row with NO payload — a file written before either was journaled, a call
// whose result never reached the file — is drawn as the line it always was and
// is NOT interactive: see [replayInert]. An expansion that opens on a blank is
// the defect this wave came to end, and offering one for a row that genuinely
// has nothing behind it would be the same defect wearing the fix's clothes.
//
// AND THE HISTORY IS DRAWN FROM THE WORDS, NOT FROM THE MODEL'S COPY OF THEM.
// A compaction pass does not delete what it shortens: it rewrites the
// conversation in place — a tool result becomes a pointer to its own bytes, a
// long run of the model's work becomes one line — and journals the whole
// rewritten window again below its marker. So the file holds the same
// conversation twice, and the transcript a resumed session opens with is the
// SHORTENED copy. [session.EarlierHistory] is the other one, with the floor that
// says where the copy ends; this file walks the transcript down to that floor and
// then carries on into the region, so the history reads as it was said and reads
// exactly once. The line where the two meet is [seamMark].

// replayTail is how much of a resumed conversation is drawn AT ONCE. Forty
// entries is about two screens of scrollback — enough to remember where you
// were, short of re-rendering an hour of work through markdown layout before
// the first frame.
//
// IT IS NO LONGER A CEILING ON WHAT CAN BE READ, and that distinction is the
// whole of this wave. It used to be both: the surface drew the last forty
// blocks and had no way to ask for the forty above them, so scrolling up hit
// the top of an hour-old conversation's last two screens and stopped, with the
// rest of it sitting in the journal underneath. Now it is the size of ONE
// helping — the opening one, and every one [app.backfill] hands up afterwards.
