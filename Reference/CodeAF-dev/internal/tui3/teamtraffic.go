// ── TRAFFIC: WHAT PASSES BETWEEN A TEAM'S MANAGER AND ITS MEMBERS ───────────
//
// The Traffic log (internal/teams' traffic.go) is the only channel between this
// interface and the team tools a model calls (internal/session): the manager's
// notes and directives, the members' posts, and the two acts the manager asks
// for, stop and start. This file is the interface's side of it, the clock, the
// read and the acts; teamrail.go draws it.
//
// THE READ IS OFF THE LOOP, AND A QUIET SECOND COSTS A STAT. A clock of its own
// ([trafficEvery]) runs while this window holds a conversation in a team that
// HAS A MANAGER, and at no other time: a team without one writes no Traffic
// worth reading here. Each turn of the clock asks, beside the door line
// ([app.besideLine]), for each held team's log after the cursor this window
// holds and for the teams file only if its stamp moved ([TeamsSeam]); the
// seam stats before it reads (internal/teams' [teamstore.Watch]), so a quiet
// log is answered with nothing from one stat, and over --host with a frame of
// a few bytes. What came back is folded into a cache on the loop, the clock is
// set for its next turn there, and when nothing was new the loop touches
// nothing and tells the frame it may draw what it drew before (view.go's still
// frame). After [trafficIdleTurns] quiet turns the clock slows to
// [trafficEveryIdle], and anything that moves brings it back. THE FRAME DRAWS
// THE CACHE AND NOTHING ELSE (framedisk_law_test.go). The same turn picks up
// the teams file when another process changed it, and gives a member its
// title when it joined before it had one ([teamstore.DeriveHandle] through the
// store's tidy, written as an ordinary edit, [app.teamEdit]).
//
// OVER --host THE CLOCK READS THE ENGINE'S LOG. The session writes its Traffic
// into the profile of the machine it runs on, and the --host door's seam asks
// that machine (internal/remote's Teams.Traffic), so the rail is the team's
// own. An engine without those doors hands no seam, and then there is no clock
// at all ([app.teamsOff]): a rail read from this window's profile would be an
// empty log drawn as if it were the team's.
//
// THE ACTS ARE DONE ONCE, AND ONLY NEW ONES. A stop addressed to a
// conversation this window holds ends that conversation's current turn, as the
// person's own stop does; a start is done by the window that holds the team's
// manager, which opens a conversation in the team's folder BEHIND the one in
// front and puts it in the team under the handle the manager chose. It never
// comes forward and it is never sent the brief as the person's words: the
// brief is the manager's, it reaches the member through the same Traffic
// delivery every other line of the manager's does, and the member's first turn
// is started by the session on seeing itself started (internal/session's
// team_wake.go). Each act is done once per entry id, remembered in memory, and
// a window opening reads the log from its TAIL, so what was asked before it
// opened is history on its rail and is never done again.
