// THIS FILE IS A MEASUREMENT AND NOT A GATE. It exists so that a claim about
// where this package's wall clock goes is a number rather than a reading of the
// code: #399 was opened on a reading that turned out to be false (the note above
// [cmdBudget] records it), and the only reason that was caught is that somebody
// counted. It is off unless CODEAF_TUI3_CMDPROFILE names a file, and when it is
// off every hook in it is one nil compare.
//
// It measures the harness, not the surface, so it lives beside [runCmd] and
// records what [runCmd] itself decides: which command was run, whether the
// command answered, and how much deadline wall was charged when it was dropped.
// An owner-proven empty waiter is recorded as a zero-wall drop; an unknown owner
// still records [cmdBudget]. The distinction is the question the design turns
// on, and it can be measured without treating scheduler latency as evidence.
