// ── WHAT A FRAME AND A POINTER COST THE FAR MACHINE ─────────────────────────
//
// These are PERF.md's laws about `--host`, and they are counts of round trips
// rather than stopwatches for the reason that file's doctrine gives: a count is
// a fact about the code and the same fact on a loaded laptop as on idle CI.
//
// WHAT THEY WERE WRITTEN AFTER. The owner reported that over a connection
// "even hover seems to slow everything down", and that clicks and keys felt
// dead. Both were one defect: the status row asked the agent what the model was
// dialled to while it was DRAWING (view.go's [app.statusRow]), a hover below
// the conversation rebuilds the chrome to find its row (view.go's
// [app.chromeAt]), and over a connection that read is a round trip on the ssh
// pipe. Measured on the loopback client at the commit before this file:
//
//	100 frames                        100 far calls
//	200 pointer motions over the foot  200 far calls
//	one frame with /model open          13 far calls
//
// At the twenty-millisecond round trip a real link has, a pointer swept across
// the foot of the window put thirty-six milliseconds of network in front of the
// update loop PER CELL — so a two-hundred-cell sweep left seven seconds of
// keystrokes and clicks queued behind it. Driven through tmux over a pipe with
// that delay, a typed character took 7.4s to appear after a burst of two
// hundred motions and 21.8s after six hundred; with the fix, 0.014s, which is
// what the same script measures on a local session.
//
// reasoninglevel.go holds the fix and the whole of the reasoning behind it.

// farAgent is [remote.WrappedAgent] for these pins: every method the engine
// serves, answering instantly. INSTANTLY IS THE POINT — what is being counted is
// how many times the SURFACE asked, and an engine that took a moment would turn
// a count into a race.
