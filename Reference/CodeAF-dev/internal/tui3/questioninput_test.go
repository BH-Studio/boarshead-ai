// THE FOUR SHAPES BELOW A QUESTION, and the blocks an asker hangs off one.
//
// These tests hold rung six of the ladder — "structured input: blanks ·
// checklist · this-or-this · dial, never free text where a key would do" — and
// the six block kinds that carry an answer's evidence. What each one owes is the
// same three things: the keys the shared grammar promises, an answer that comes
// back structured rather than as a sentence somebody has to parse, and a linear
// shape for the reader tier.
