// ── A CONVERSATION'S WORK IS A TREE, AND HOME DREW IT AS A ROW OF STRANGERS ──
//
// A conversation hands work out, and the work it hands out hands more out. The
// index records exactly that — [session.TaskIndexEntry.Parent] is the row that
// asked for this one — and every reader that walks [session.TaskRollup.Rows] as
// a flat slice throws the relationship away. Home threw it away everywhere: the
// card's `work` band, the phone sheet's, the fold at the foot of both. Three
// pieces of ONE run stood side by side as three peers, in whatever order their
// end stamps happened to fall, and the fold — which counts things, not families
// — could cut a child away from the row that is the only thing on the screen
// explaining what it was for.
//
// SO HOME GROWS THE TREE ONCE, HERE, AND EVERY HOME SURFACE DRAWS THE SAME ONE.
// The CONVERSATION is the parent of all of it: it is the row in the list, its
// name is the card's title, and opening it opens the chat. What hangs under that
// is the work — each piece under the piece that asked for it, to whatever depth
// the index recorded — and opening one of THOSE opens that task's own record.
// One heading, one tree, two doors that cannot be confused for each other.
//
// FOUR LAWS COME OUT OF IT, AND THEY ARE WHAT THE TESTS PIN:
//
//   - A CHILD NEVER PRECEDES ITS VISIBLE ANCESTORS. The phone band folds whole
//     families. The desktop preview fits three task names in depth-first order,
//     so a large family stays compact while every visible child has context.
//   - A FAMILY STANDS WHERE ITS MOST URGENT MEMBER PUTS IT: what will not move
//     without a person, then what is still going, then what is over. A CHILD
//     THAT NEEDS SOMEBODY CARRIES ITS WHOLE FAMILY FORWARD, because the row that
//     explains that child is its root, and a surface that promoted the child
//     alone would be showing the answer with the question folded away.
//   - TIES KEEP THE RECORD'S OWN ORDER, which is newest first with live work
//     counted as now (internal/session's [sortTaskIndex]). Nothing here re-dates
//     a row, filters one out or invents one — every entry in the rollup comes
//     out of the walk exactly once, which [homeWorkFamilies] guarantees even for
//     a parent seam that points at nothing or points in a circle.
//   - THE CONNECTORS ARE THE ROSTER'S OWN (task.go's [treeBranch] and its
//     neighbours) and are not re-spelled here. The roster hangs work off work
//     with the plain elbow; home hanging the same work off the same parent with
//     a different mark would be two vocabularies for one fact.
