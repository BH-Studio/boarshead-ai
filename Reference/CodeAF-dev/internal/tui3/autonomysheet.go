// ── /autonomy — WHAT THIS PROJECT DOES WHILE NOBODY IS THERE ────────────────
//
// THE SHEET, EXACTLY AS IT IS DRAWN:
//
//	questions while you are away
//	permission       ask me
//	choice           recommend, auto in 30s
//	judgement        ask me
//	clarification    ask me · never runs on a clock
//	confirmation     ask me · destructive always asks
//	landing          decide yourself
//	assumptions      recommend, auto in 10m
//	already done     ask me
//	/autonomy <kind> ask · recommend [duration] · decide
//
// ── WHY IT IS PER PROJECT AND NOT PER PROFILE ──
//
// The engine stores it in the project (`.codeaf/autonomy.json`, session's
// autonomy.go), and the reason is the whole point of the setting: the same shape
// of question deserves a different answer in two pieces of work. `permission` on
// a scratch repository somebody is exploring is a key press; `permission` on the
// thing that deploys is a decision. A profile-wide rule would make one of those
// two wrong everywhere.
//
// ── THE TWO ROWS NOBODY MAY CHANGE ──
//
// CONFIRMATION ALWAYS ASKS. It is the shape asked before something destructive,
// and stop.go's law — "there is no bypass key, no modifier that skips the
// question, and no don't-ask-me-again" — is that sentence about this row.
//
// CLARIFICATION NEVER RUNS ON A CLOCK. The answer is information only the person
// has, so a clock could not take it: there is nothing for it to take.
//
// The engine refuses both at its own door ([session.Agent.SetAutonomy]) and this
// sheet says so on the rows, because a setting that looks changeable and is not
// is worse than one that says why.

// path is rebuilt from nothing on every frame; the answer changes when somebody
// types a slash command.
