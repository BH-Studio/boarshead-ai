// ── ONE FACT, TWO PACKAGES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE CONSTRAINT. `internal/session` keeps the newest answered questions in its
// book so that `c change` and `u undo` have something to render a revision
// against ([session.askSettledKept]). The surface is what OFFERS those keys, and
// it offers them on the receipts it is drawing ([questionRecordsKept]). So the
// engine's cap may never be smaller than the surface's count: a receipt on
// screen wearing `c change` whose entry the engine had already dropped is a key
// drawn as pressable that refuses.
//
// AND IT IS A LAW RATHER THAN A COMMENT BECAUSE THE TWO NUMBERS CANNOT BE MADE
// ONE. `internal/session` cannot import `internal/tui3` — the arrow points the
// other way — so the figure cannot be interpolated the way ONE SOURCE OF TRUTH
// asks for (CLAUDE.md). What can be done is this: read the other number out of
// the tree and fail when the relationship breaks, so the day somebody raises the
// surface's count the build says which other file has to move. The reason is
// lane A's (#954): the constant's own doc states the constraint, names this
// figure, and says which half of its own value is the rule and which half is a
// guess.

// constInt reads one integer constant out of a package's source.
