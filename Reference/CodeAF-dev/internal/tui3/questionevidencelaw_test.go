// ONE ACCOUNT OF AN ANSWER'S CASE, AND ONE RENDERER FOR WHAT IT DREW.
//
// An answer's evidence is drawn in four places — the pane beside a wide panel's
// list, the fold under a narrow panel's pointer, the page's right pane and the
// page's one column — and before questionevidence.go each place that drew the
// labelled case spelled it itself: the page wrote `then ·` and `would switch if`
// on its own and the panel wrote its one-line case on its own, and the two
// disagreed about whether a model's `If you…` was joined onto `would switch if`
// twice. These laws hold the seam shut:
//
//   - the words that label a case line are READ in questionevidence.go and
//     nowhere else (their declarations stand where the page's other words are
//     spelled), so a new drawing of the case has to go through [questionCase];
//   - the five block renderers are called by [app.questionBlockRows] and by each
//     other in questionblocks.go, and from no other file, so a new drawing of
//     evidence cannot grow a diagram painter of its own.

// questionCaseWords are the labels of an answer's case.
var questionCaseWords = []string{"questionThenWord", "questionWhyWord", "questionWouldSwitchWord", "questionConfidenceLabel"}

// questionBlockPainters are the renderers behind [app.questionBlockRows].

// THE SAFE ANSWER IS MARKED BY ONE PREDICATE, AND SPELLED IN ONE PLACE.
//
// A question's refusal is drawn in two places — a panel's own answer rows
// ([app.questionPanelOption]) and the `deny all` row of a permission frame
// ([app.questionGroupRows]) — and for a while each decided FOR ITSELF whether to
// mark it. The panel asked `option.Safe && questionHandsOnly(q) && q.Pick ==
// nil`; the frame asked whether its pointer was on the row, and then asked
// nothing at all. Both spellings drifted from the panel's within one pull
// request of being written, and the second drifted in the direction that matters
// most: `2 one by one` opens a frame's own members as tabs, so a frame marking a
// row those tabs leave bare changed what the surface claimed about the same four
// questions between one keystroke and the next.
//
// So [questionSafeWord] is READ in questionpanel.go and nowhere else, behind
// [app.questionSafeAside], and whether to draw it is [questionMarksSafe] — over
// one question, or folded by [questionSetMarksSafe] over a set. A third drawing
// of a question has to come through them, and cannot quietly invent a third
// rule about when a person is told where their way out is.
