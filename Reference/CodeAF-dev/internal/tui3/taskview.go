// WHAT THE TASKS PLACE IS MADE OF, minus the place itself.
//
// The place is three files. tasksplace.go is the READING — pure, and the only
// thing that decides what a row says. place_tasks.go is the PLACE — the cursor,
// the scroll, the keyboard, the pointer and the frame. This file is what is left
// over and belongs to neither:
//
//   - THE WORDS. The page's key, its command's name, the two section words the
//     column's tally already spends, and the sentences its foot offers each hand.
//   - WHAT THE OTHER WINDOWS HAVE OUT, and the ONE ladder that judges a claim of
//     running ([app.recordRuns]) — asked by the column and by the place alike.
//   - THE ROSTER'S SIDE of the join: which node of this session's graph a row of
//     the record names ([app.taskSheetNodeFor]), and the one dim door the column
//     carries onto this place ([app.railHasRecord]).
//
// It exists because the roster answers one question and a person keeps asking
// two. The column beside the conversation is THIS SESSION'S record of its own
// work ([app.railEntries] walks [app.taskOrder] and nothing else), which is the
// right answer to "what is happening" and no answer at all to "what did we do
// about this last week". The machine has that answer on disk — internal/session
// keeps a tasks.jsonl beside the conversations in every project — and until this
// place the only door onto it was the "@" drop-up, which is a completion
// somebody has to already be typing a message to reach.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO IS SHARE THE COLUMN. The column carried a dulled footnote
// of this same record under its live rows for a while, and it was the wrong
// place for it: six rows out of two thousand is not a record, the rows pushed the
// column's own "no tasks yet" off the top, and a person walking the roster's
// cursor fell out of this conversation's work into another one's without the
// column ever saying they had. So the column is THIS CONVERSATION'S WORK AND
// NOTHING ELSE, and what stands at the foot of it is ONE DIM DOOR onto this page
// ([taskSheetPastHint], drawn by task.go's [app.railFootRows]) whenever the
// project has a record to open. Every row of old work — and every door into one —
// is here.

// The page's own key, and the words that name it.
//
// ctrl+. IS THE LAST OBVIOUS CHORD AND IT IS SPENT DELIBERATELY. Every
// ctrl+<letter> this surface could reach for is taken — the readline edits the
// message box answers without looking, the roster's alt+t, the column's ctrl+g,
// copy mode's ctrl+b — and the four letters that are free are documented as NOT
// BOUND, which is a promise a person has read. What is left is the punctuation
// pair, and the pair is the point: ctrl+, opens the settings panel and ctrl+.
// opens this one, two adjacent keys for the two fullscreen pages. A terminal
// that cannot send one cannot send the other either, which is why this page has
// two more doors — /history, and the line at the bottom of the column.

	// /history. "/task <brief>" means GIVE codeaf WORK, and it has three rows in
	// the command list; a "/tasks" beside them narrowed to both on the four
	// characters they share, so the muscle memory for starting work led to a page
	// that starts none. What a person calls this thing is the record of everything
	// the project has run, and "history" is that word.

// land in this project's history. The first is a guess about another process and
// the second is a promise about a run that may be stopped, may fail, and may be
// in a window that is about to close. Both are gone.
//
// WHAT IS LEFT IS WHAT IS KNOWN: where the work is, and the one thing to do
// about it.
//
// AND THIS CARD IS THE LAST RUNG AND NOT THE FIRST. A row whose conversation
// this terminal is holding, or whose conversation the engine will hand this

// THE FOOT, AS SCREEN 1e SPELLS IT.
//
// The design draws one line under this place:
//
//	enter open its room · → verbs: run it again, stop it · type to filter · tab next place
//
// Three of its four clauses are built here and the fourth is the router's — it
// appends `alt+. map · tab next place` to every place's sentence ([placeTailed]),
// so a foot that wrote `tab next place` itself would be the frame naming a key
// twice. What is left is the imperative grammar of the design — `open`, `go`,
// `type` — in place of the older third-person one this page used to spell.
//
// AND THE `type to filter` CLAUSE HAS SINCE LEFT THIS LINE FOR THE BOX. The
// design put it here because there was nowhere else for it: the box below said
// `say what you want done` on every place, which on this one was an invitation to
// send a message into a slot that only narrows the list, and a foot clause was the
// only correction available. The box says the true sentence itself now
// ([tasksTypeWord], place_tasks.go's [placeTasks.resting]), so this line stopped
// repeating it — one screen may not name one thing twice. What the foot keeps
// that the box cannot say is `esc clear the filter`, which is only true while a
// filter is on.
//
// EVERY CLAUSE IS TRUE OF THE ROW UNDER THE CURSOR OR IT IS NOT DRAWN. That is
// this surface's own law — no key does anything that is not drawn on screen
// right now, and nothing is named that is not bound (verbstrip.go states it) —
// and it is why the design's one static line is assembled rather than quoted:
// `enter` opens a ROOM only over a node this window is holding, a CARD over work
// another conversation ran, and over work another WINDOW is running the card
// that says where that window is — three doors, three clauses, and the row under
// the cursor decides which of them is said.

//
// A person with two codeaf windows open on one directory would start a task in
// the first, look at the second, and find no trace of it anywhere: not in the
// column, not on this page, not in the "@" list. The reason is in
// internal/session's taskelsewhere.go — an ordinary task writes NO row into the
// project's index until it lands, so there is nothing on disk for a second
// window to read — and the fix is the presence file every live session already
// keeps, which says what that session has out at this instant.
//
// TWO THINGS COME OUT OF ONE READING, and they are drawn in two different places
// for one reason: the roster's tree is THIS SESSION'S work and stays that way
// ([app.railEntries] walks [app.taskOrder] and nothing else), because a tree
// with another window's nodes hanging off it would be a shape that claims a
// parentage nothing has. So:
//
//   - THE TASKS PLACE'S `running` SECTION gains a row per piece of work another
//     window is holding, beside this session's own, each with the window it
//     belongs to on the right.
//   - EVERY RECORD ROW, on this page and in the column alike, gets its claim of
//     running judged against the same reading ([app.recordRuns]).

// elsewhereEvery is how long ONE reading of the other windows is held before
// another is taken.
//
// THREE SECONDS, AND IT IS A CADENCE RATHER THAN A CACHE SIZE. The reading is a
// directory read plus two small files per window, which is nothing on a clock
// and thirty times a second on a frame — and the thing being read only changes
// every [session.presenceHeartbeat] anyway, so a shorter window would buy
// re-reads of a file nobody has rewritten. It is the ONE number: the paint clock
// asks for a refresh while the roster or this page is on the frame and this

//     owner are the ones [app.taskSheetOwnRows] mints out of THIS session's own
//     graph, before its journal has a folder to be named after
//     ([app.taskIndexHolds] says why a graph row can carry no conversation id).
//   - A row that names one is ours only if it names US. An earlier reading let a
//     window whose own id was unknown claim ANY row, on the argument that a
//     comparison needs two names — and the conclusion it drew from not knowing
//     was the dangerous one. A record that says `this belongs to session X` is a
//     fact; a window that cannot say whether it is X has not contradicted it,
//     and must not act as though it had.
//
// WHAT THAT COSTS, HONESTLY. A conversation whose journal id and whose folder
// name genuinely disagree loses the ROOM on its own landed rows and gets the
// card instead — one door narrower, and never somebody else's task. That is the
// trade, and it is the right way round: the failure this replaced opened a live
// room drawing a different task's transcript.

// and a run replayed out of a checkpoint all produce exactly that pair. What
// happened then was the worst shape a navigation defect can take — the row

// chances for two screens to disagree about one finished task.

// the wire or a threshold ended says `incomplete` rather than `failed`, and a

// ── the one door the column has onto this page ──────────────────────────────

// THE COLUMN IS THIS CONVERSATION'S WORK AND THE PROJECT'S RECORD IS THIS PAGE'S,
// and the two are joined by exactly one dim line.
//
// It was not always so. The column carried a footnote of the record under its
// live rows — at most six flat rows, dulled, walkable, each a door into a card —
// and it was put there to solve a real problem: a person opening codeaf in a
// directory they had worked in for a month saw a column saying "no tasks yet",
// and nothing on the frame suggested that a month of finished work was one chord
// away. The footnote made the work visible and cost more than it was worth. Six
// rows out of two thousand is not a record, it is a sample; the sample stood
// where the column's own empty label goes, so the column stopped being able to
// say what it was for; and the roster's cursor walked out of this conversation's
// work into somebody else's without the column ever saying it had.
//
// SO THE VISIBILITY IS KEPT AND THE ROWS ARE NOT. The foot of the column carries
// [taskSheetPastHint] — `ctrl+. earlier`, dim, one line — whenever the project
// has a record behind it, and that line is the door: it names the page, it says
// what is on it, and it is pressed as readily as it is typed (task.go's
// [app.railFootRows] draws it, [app.railPress] answers it). Everything the
// footnote used to offer is on the other side of it, whole: every row, the
// filter, the cards, the mention.

// railHasRecord reports whether the project has finished work this session did
// not run — which is the ONLY question the column asks of the record, and the
// question that decides whether its foot carries a door (task.go's
// [app.railFootRows]).
//
// THE MEMBERSHIP RULE IS THE PAGE'S ([app.taskSheetNodeFor]): a row whose id and
// title name a node of this session's graph is that node, and the column is
// already drawing it — so a directory whose whole record is this conversation's
// own work has nothing behind a door and is offered none.
//

// enough to ask on every frame: the record runs to two thousand rows and the
// common answer costs one comparison rather than a walk of all of them.
