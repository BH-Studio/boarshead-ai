// THE HARNESS OFFER.
//
// internal/session matched what somebody just typed against this build's
// sub-harness registry and found one that says it does exactly this
// (internal/subharness). The turn is held — before its first request — on one
// question:
//
//	? run harness "research" [1] run it · [2] not now · [esc] later
//	  finds an answer across sources · model: claude-opus-5
//
// THE BLOCK DRAWS IT NOW (question.go). What used to be here was a row of this
// lane's own — its own layout arithmetic, its own two keys, its own pressable
// columns and its own idea of what `esc` meant — and every law it carried had to
// be argued again in eight other blocks that never got round to it
// (docs/design/questions/DESIGN.md).
//
// It is still ONE ROW, which was the whole of that row's design and is now a
// fact about the object rather than about a renderer: the offer names a
// [session.FormLine], because the name is the whole question and the no costs
// nothing — declining refuses no call, cancels no connection and loses no turn,
// so the turn the person typed runs unchanged and immediately.
//
// What is left in this file is the lane's own two things: the model the offer
// SHOWED, handed back with the answer so that what runs is what was read, and
// the design lane below.

// an agent that has been replaced must not put a card on the screen of the
// conversation that replaced it.

// IT CARRIES TWO THINGS AND NOT THREE. The announce, and the card. What BECAME
// of a design used to ride here as a third — a note saying it was saved, dropped
// or failed — and it does not any more: the design is a task, and a task's
// ending is a settle card in the transcript with the outcome on it (taskdone.go).

// number a person could say out loud.
//
// EVERY ONE OF THOSE EXISTS NOW, so the chip is gone and the design takes an
// ordinary place on the strip beside the tasks (session's harness_task.go). It
// has an id, a title that leads with the word "harness", a phase on its row that
// moves from "designing" to "awaiting your look", a room with the whole design
// thread in it, and the same ✕ every other node is stopped by. A second chip for
// the same work would have been the strip drawing it twice, and the one it kept
// is the one that opens.
