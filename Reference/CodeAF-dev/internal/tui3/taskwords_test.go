// THE WORDS A PERSON READS ABOUT A TASK, AND THE ONES THEY NEVER DO.
//
// A task, on this surface, is one of four things: it is running (which includes
// every private round the engine runs on it to close a gap), it is done, it is
// incomplete with the gaps named, or — the rare case — it finished and needs a
// person's look because nothing came back that could call it either way. That
// list has no fifth member and it has no machinery in it.
//
// The two halves of this file are the two halves of that law. The first is what
// a node closing a gap SAYS while it does it: one plain line, in the one place a
// person is watching, and gone the moment the gap is closed. The second is the
// sweep — every surface a landed node reaches, every terminal state, and not one
// word of the apparatus that decided anything.

// ── the finishing line ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// mendingNotice is the update the engine sends while a node closes a named gap:
// still RUNNING, because it is running, with the one line that says what is left
