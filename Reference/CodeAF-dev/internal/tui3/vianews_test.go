// WHY `via <provider>` AND tok/s WENT MISSING, one test per cause.
//
// The owner, 2026-09-10: "at some times I don't see infra provider and tok/sec,
// I am not sure when it does not show up, maybe when I have follow up or
// something". It was not one bug with a random trigger; it was six, each with a
// trigger a person would never connect to the gap:
//
//  1. any model with a reasoning level set lost the live rate, because the
//     status row lent the model field `id:level` for its draw and the rate is
//     looked up by that field;
//  2. `via` vanished whenever the vendor served its own model (`deepseek/…` by
//     DeepSeek), because one layer still kept a suppression the owner had
//     ruled away and the fallback under it is empty over an engine host;
//  3. a rescue that failed blanked `via`, and a rescue promised by a turn that
//     was then interrupted stayed promised for ten minutes;
//  4. `via` waited for a whole step to finish, so the first answer — and any
//     follow-up after ten quiet minutes — showed none while it was written;
//  5. the conversation's news was filed by model id, which drifts between the
//     engine and the window (a mid-turn pick, a fallback hop, another window);
//  6. an engine host from before the news crossed the wire sent none, and
//     nothing said so.
//
// Every test draws through the real row a person reads — the seam
// ([app.legend]), the status row ([app.statusRow]) or a room's line.
