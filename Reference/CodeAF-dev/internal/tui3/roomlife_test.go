// ── EVERY STRETCH OF A TASK'S LIFE SAYS SOMETHING TRUE AND MOVING ───────────
//
// From the moment a task is admitted to the moment its answer comes back, the
// page a person is standing on has to say what is happening — and it has to stop
// saying the last thing the instant it stops being true. A word left standing
// from the life before is the same fault as a blank page: the person reads it,
// believes it, and goes looking for a fault that is not there.
//
// The words themselves are owned elsewhere and each has its own test — the room
// header's ladder (room.go's [app.roomStateWord]), the phase words
// (taskphase.go), the "nothing yet" line (roomunlanded_test.go). This walks ONE
// node through all of them in one page's life, which is the thing none of those
// can check: that each stretch draws immediately, and that nothing from the
// stretch before survives into it.
