// ── A TOOL CALL IS ONE ROW UNTIL SOMEBODY OPENS IT ──────────────────────────
//
// The line was already fitted to the width it was handed; what these pin is that
// the width it was handed is the width it is DRAWN in, and that the text it
// measured is the text the terminal will draw.
//
// Two things broke that, and both of them made a call eat four rows where it had
// asked for one:
//
//   - THE INDENT LAW WAS PAID BY THE LINE AND NOT BY THE BLOCK. render.go shoves
//     every work row two columns right after layout, and [app.toolLine] subtracts
//     those two cells before it lays itself out. The block hanging under it did
//     not, so every row of an open call's evidence was drawn two cells wider than
//     the frame — and a row two cells over does not get an ellipsis from the
//     terminal, it gets a second visual row.
//   - THE TEXT WAS SOMEBODY ELSE'S BYTES, MEASURED AS IF IT WERE OURS. A tab
//     measures nothing and draws up to eight cells; a carriage return measures
//     nothing and sends the cursor home; an escape sequence measures nothing and
//     repaints rows this surface owns. [drawableLine] is the rule, and it was
//     being applied to a background job's log and to nothing else.

// clampArgs is one tool's arguments as JSON, so a command with quotes, tabs and
// escapes in it reaches the surface the way session sends it rather than the way
// a hand-written literal survives.
