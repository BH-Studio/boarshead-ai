// THE PAGE OVER THE KILL RING: /drafts, the box's lost sentences as a list.
//
// ↑ walks what you SENT (recall.go) and visits the ring in front of it, dim;
// this page is the same ring as its own screen — the door for the person who
// knows it was more than a step or two back, or who wants the whole ten to
// choose from rather than walk for the one. What it lists is written by
// [app.noteKilled] at every whole-box clear (draftring.go says what lands and
// what never does), and the two readers share one rule: the list is newest
// first and a restored line LEAVES the ring, because a line back in the box
// is no longer lost.
//
// ENTER RESTORES OVER WHAT IS THERE, AND IT NEVER THROWS AWAY. A box with
// words in it when the page opens is a draft too, so restoring pushes it onto
// the ring before the chosen line takes the box — the act of recovering one
// sentence cannot cost another. That is the ring's own law (push's comment
// says why an empty box records nothing) applied to the one clear this page
// performs itself.

// draftHeading is the page's one heading line: what is listed, and what enter
// and d do, because this list's two keys are the half of it nobody can guess
// (the hint line says them too; the heading is where a person reading the
// page itself finds them).

// draftEmptyWord is THE ONE LINE the page draws with nothing in the ring. The
// emptiness law is about facts unknown at draw time; an empty ring is a KNOWN
// fact — the clear a person is looking for never happened — and a page that
// answered /drafts with blank space would read as a page that failed to open
// rather than as a page saying so.
