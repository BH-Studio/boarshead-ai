// `x` — THE ANSWERS LAID AGAINST EACH OTHER, AND ONLY WHERE THEY DIFFER.
//
// docs/design/questions/DESIGN.md: "x compare on the asker's dimensions
// (fallback: +/− lines)", and "compare stacks under 80 cols".
//
// WHY DIFFERENCES ONLY. Three answers with eight axes is a twenty-four cell
// table of which perhaps five cells carry the decision, and a person reading the
// other nineteen is a person reading for the third time that all three answers
// run on this machine. An axis every answer agrees on is not a comparison, it is
// context — and the row it would occupy is the row the axis that DOES decide the
// question has to be found in. So an axis whose readings are all the same is
// dropped, and the foot says so, because a table that silently hid rows would be
// a table nobody could trust.
//
// THE FALLBACK IS THE CONSEQUENCE LINES. Most askers will not fill in
// [session.AnswerOption.Dimensions] — it is the most structured field on the
// object and the last one a model reaches for — but nearly every one of them
// writes the `+ …` and `− …` lines under an answer, because those are what a
// person asks for out loud. Those lines ARE axes with the axis name left off: a `+`
// is something this answer gains and a `−` is something it costs, so the
// fallback lays them out as two rows and the table is worth opening on a
// question nobody wrote a dimension for.
//
