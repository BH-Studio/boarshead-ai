// ANSWERING A DESIGN WHERE YOU ARE STANDING.
//
// The card in the conversation was once the only door onto a design's one
// question, and the room underneath it — the place people actually are when the
// page lands — had no way to answer at all. A second row was grown in there to
// fix that (roomapproval.go), with two chords of its own, and for a while one
// decision had two drawings and two grammars.
//
// It has one of each now. A finished page is a question, and every question this
// engine hands a person is drawn once, above the box, by the block
// (question.go) — which is pinned to the frame and therefore already in the room.
// These tests hold that: the answers are there while the design waits, they are
// the same three digits they are out in the conversation, they resolve the same
// design, and the two keys the room owns are still the room's.
//
// The last one is about the tally, which was lying in the other direction: a
// design whose only remaining step is a person's counted as work in progress.
