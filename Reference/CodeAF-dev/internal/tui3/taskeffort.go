// ── ONE TASK'S PLACE ON THE EFFORT LADDER ───────────────────────────────────
//
// A task is a whole session of its own with its own workers, and the rung it
// runs at is its own fact (internal/session's [Agent.SetTaskEffort], which rides
// the checkpoint). This file is the surface's half: what `alt+e` is aimed at
// while a person is standing on a task, and the clause the room states the rung
// in. The scope rules for every other surface are in effortscope.go.

// taskEffortDoor is the fifth door onto a node, beside the four in room.go: the
// rung its workers think at, read and moved.
//
// IT IS ITS OWN INTERFACE for the reason [taskModelDoor] is: a capability is
// asserted, never required. An engine that streams nodes but has never heard of
// the ladder keeps its rooms, states no rung, names no key in the legend, and is
// in the honest degraded state rather than the broken one.

// where a person happens to be, the roster is what they just asked for and
// walked a cursor across. So a rung moved while the roster holds the keyboard
// moves the ROW UNDER THE CURSOR, which is the row wearing the ground, and never
// the page behind it. `x` resolves the other way round (stop.go's
// [app.stopHere]) because its own key is read one rung ABOVE the roster; each of
// the two agrees with the dispatcher it is reached through, which is the only
// way a person can predict either.
