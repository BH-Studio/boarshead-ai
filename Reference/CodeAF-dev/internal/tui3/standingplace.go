// THE STANDING PLACE'S READING: WHAT IS TRUE, TURNED INTO ROWS AND THEN INTO
// LINES.
//
// This file is PURE. It never sees the surface itself, never asks the clock,
// and never touches the disk — everything it needs arrives as data assembled by
// place_standing.go, so a cursor move can redraw the whole screen without
// reaching a seam and two rows of one frame can never be two ages apart.

//
// Four decisions, and three of them are borrowed rather than invented:
//
//   - THE SHELVES ARE THE THREE REACHES, in the order a person reads outward
//     from where they are standing: this conversation, this project,
//     everywhere. Each one is a heading and no more — the rows under it are what
//     the shelf is about, and a heading with a count beside it would be the
//     screen counting what a person can see.
//   - AND A FOURTH SHELF IS THE REST OF THE MACHINE. The three reaches answer
//     "what is true HERE"; a person who came to this screen to find the order
//     they set up last week in another project was shown a page that did not
//     have it and did not say so. So what stands outside this conversation is
//     drawn under a heading of its own, at the bottom, after everything that
//     reaches where the person is sitting — the same outward reading carried one
//     step further.
//   - AN EMPTY SHELF DRAWS NOTHING AT ALL. Not the heading, not a "nothing
//     here", not a rule where the rows would have been. That is the emptiness
//     law at its most literal, and it is what makes this page one line long on
//     the ordinary conversation with one order over it.
//   - THE STATUS CLAUSE IS HOME'S OWN ([standRollup]). An item's tail — needs
//     your look, checking now, paused, the cadence, what the last look found —
//     is one derivation with one set of words, and a page that wrote a second
//     one would be two screens disagreeing about the same item in front of the
//     same person.
//
// AND THERE IS NO FOLD. The list showed four rows and hid the rest behind a
// `▸ N more` line no key answered; a place takes the whole terminal, so the
// window is whatever the frame had room for and the cursor walks the rest.

//
// THE WINDOW SCOPES WHAT IS LISTED, AND IT OPENS HOLDING EVERYTHING. A reference

// the machine has and opens on a span that reaches it, and narrowing is then the
// person's own deliberate act rather than a default they never chose.
//
// AND AN ORDER THAT HAS NEVER FIRED IS NEVER SCOPED AWAY. A rule that only holds
// is never examined and never fires; a watch whose first moment has not come has
// no firing either. Neither has a date to be outside a window, and filtering a
// record by a fact it does not have is the emptiness law broken from the far
// side — it would answer "not in this fortnight" about something that was never
// anywhere.
