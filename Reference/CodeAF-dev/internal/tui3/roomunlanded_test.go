// THE OTHER HALF OF THE ROOM'S OWN LAW. roomgone_test.go pins the page a LANDED
// node draws when it has nothing to replay; these pin the page a node that has
// NOT landed draws in the same state. The law room.go states over
// [app.roomRecordRows] — a room is never an empty body under a correct header —
// was enforced for the landed half only, so a queued or running node whose page
// had no blocks yet drew a correct header over a screen with NOTHING on it: the
// worst page this surface can draw, and the one a person reads as the program
// having lost their work.
