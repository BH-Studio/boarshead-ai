// ── THE SPENDING TAB ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Money has ONE EDITOR and MANY DOORS (docs/design/spending/DESIGN.md). The
// editor is this tab: the registry's four money rows, in the order a person
// worries about them, with the day's own bill above them and — between them —
// the two rails this build enforces somewhere a settings row cannot reach.
//
//	 today             $3.42 of $500 · resets at midnight
//	 per day           $500
//	 per conversation  no limit                          this one $0.41
//	 per plan          asks first above $100
//	 per task          $5 a task                         set in /crew
//	 per standing run  $5 a firing                       each order may name its own
//	 practice          $50 of the day
//
// Three of those seven base rows are READINGS and not settings, and the
// difference is the whole of what keeps this tab honest:
//
//   - `today` is where the eye lands, and it answers "what is it costing" before
//     anybody edits anything. It is a receipt: the cursor steps over it, and
//     before the first call of the day it is not there at all (the emptiness
//     law — a `$0.00 of $500` on a fresh morning is a claim nobody made).
//   - `per task` and `per standing run` are rails this build HAS and does not
//     keep a settings row for. A task's limit is set in /crew, and a standing
//     order's per-firing rail is written per item on the `stand` tool. The
//     design asked for seven rows and the honest way to have seven is to SAY what those two rails are,
//     not to grow two knobs that write nowhere. A row that pretended to edit a
//     rail nothing reads would be worse than the absence it was covering.
//
// Two more readings exist only when a figure is short: `unwritten` for a row
// the disk could not take, and `unbilled` for a charged call no provider receipt
// could price. Their zero state is absence, so the ordinary seven-row tab stays
// exactly seven rows wide.
//
// EVERY VALUE ON THIS TAB IS A SENTENCE FRAGMENT COMPLETING "it may spend…",
// and every one of them degrades through rowfit rather than being cut: the
// label is the identity and stays whole, the value gives up its longest
// spelling first, and the receipt is the first thing off the row (rowfit.go's
// law 3, the design's "Narrow widths").

// railReading is one row of this tab that is a fact rather than a knob: what it
// is called, what it says, and the dim fact beside that. Both are [rowField]s
// because every one of them has a shorter spelling for a narrower frame.
