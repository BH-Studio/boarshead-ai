// ── THE SPEND PLACE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// What this machine has cost, by the day, by the model, and by what it was for
// (SCREEN 2c). Three questions of the same rows and nothing else, and the two
// arrow axes that move between them (SCREEN 3d).
//
// THE FIGURES ARE THE BILL AND NOT AN ESTIMATE. Every model call writes one
// line to a machine-wide ledger where it was made (internal/session's
// usage_ledger.go), and this page adds those lines up. It is the only place on
// the surface that can answer "what did opus cost me this month" or "what did
// Tuesday cost", because a conversation's own spend is a lifetime scalar with
// no day and no model in it.
//
// THE LEDGER IS READ THROUGH A CACHE AND ON A CLOCK, NEVER ON A DRAW. The file
// grows by a line per call, so a reader that re-parsed it whenever it changed
// would re-parse it after every turn forever; [session.UsageCache] keeps what it
// has parsed and reads only what was appended since. The read happens when this
// place opens and on the place clock's beat (placecounts.go), and every draw
// after that is arithmetic over lines already in memory.
//
// THERE IS NO BUDGET EDITOR HERE AND THERE WILL NOT BE ONE. The allowance is a
// rail, it is drawn on the status line's money segment, and it is edited on the
// segment that shows it — the label between the arrows being the reading and the
// control at once is the same move that segment already makes. A second place to
// set it would be a second answer to what the ceiling is.

// spendPage is the whole spend place: which window it is showing, the lines it
// is showing it over, and the row the cursor is on.
type spendPage struct {
	// cache is this surface's reader over the machine-wide ledger. It holds

	// top and shown are the WINDOW the last draw put over the body: the first
	// line of the reading that was drawn, and how many of them fit. The window
	// follows the cursor ([placeTop]) rather than being scrolled on its own, and
	// the pair is what turns a row of the terminal back into a line of the body
	// for the pointer (pages.go's [app.placeBodyPress]).
	top, shown int
	// hover is the line of the reading the pointer is over, and -1 for none.
	// Mouse navigation moves the shared cursor to this line.
	hover int
	// unfolded is whether the subjects' fold is open. It lasts while the place
	// is up and a fresh visit starts it shut, as every fold on a place does.
	unfolded bool
	// woke is whether focus has been put at the page's centre of mass yet on
	// this visit; after that the cursor is the person's.
	woke bool
	// read is the instant the lines were read, and every figure and age on the
	// page is measured from it rather than from a fresh clock.
	read time.Time
	// held is whether the ledger holds ANY priced line at all, in any window, and
	// it is what tells the two empty pages apart — the same fact and the same
	// argument as the standing and tasks places' own ([standingPlace.held]).
	//
	// A WINDOW EMPTIED BY THE ARROWS IS NOT AN EMPTY MACHINE. Both draw no rows,
	// and the right answer to each is the opposite of the other: a machine that
	// has spent nothing wants the frame to say what arrives here
	// ([placeWhisper]), while a window paged onto a quiet fortnight wants the
	// HEADER — the control that pages it back — above nothing at all. Drawing the
	// whisper in both cases swallowed the only way out of the second.

	// NOT. [app.rebuildSpend] runs on every `shift+←` — at key-repeat rate,

	// ([app.askSpendSeats], [session.Agent.PlanSpend]). THE WINDOW ARROWS RE-ASK IT
	// and they are the one keystroke that does: the rollup arrives already summed
