// ── THE QUOTED HALF OF A LANDED CARD ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The card's second row quotes what the work came to, and the report it quotes
// is the model's own markdown. A model that opens with a fenced block — a diff,
// a command's output, a JSON result — spends that row on the fence marker itself
// unless the reading skips it, and `"```"` is the row saying nothing at all
// (#889). These pin every road the reading can take.

// THE FIRST PROSE LINE, OVER THE TABLE. A leading fence is skipped whether a
// language word follows it or not, blank lines are skipped, a report that is
// nothing but a fence quotes the first line inside it, and a report with no
// prose at all returns nothing — which is the emptiness law's case, not this
// reader's.
