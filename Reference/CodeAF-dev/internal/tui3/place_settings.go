//
// How this machine is set: every row of the profile, under its own inner tab
// bar, with one box that searches across all of them.
//
// THE PANEL ITSELF IS settings.go's AND STAYS THERE. That file is the registry
// join, the value editors, the model picker and the account rows — two thousand
// lines of what a SETTING is — and none of it is about being a place. What is
// here is the place: the handle the registry files, and the dozen answers the
// frame asks of it. The same split every other room keeps
// (docs/design/home-rethink/ARCHITECTURE.md's three layers).
//
// IT IS THE ONE PLACE WITH A SECOND BAR INSIDE IT, and the two are not a
// repetition: the nav at the top is the places and the bar in the body is this
// place's own sections.

// placeSettings is this place's handle on the registry (pages.go's [place]
// states the contract and why the handle holds no state of its own).
