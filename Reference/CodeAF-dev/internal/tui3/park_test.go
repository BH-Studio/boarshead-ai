// WHAT A MESSAGE TYPED WHILE AN ANSWER IS STILL COMING DOES.
//
// The defect these pin came off a live session: an answer was streaming, the
// person typed "do much more of a deep resaerch please", pressed enter — and
// their sentence was drawn INTO THE MIDDLE of the reply, between two paragraphs
// of the same flowing answer. Two things were wrong and each is pinned on its
// own here, because either could come back without the other:
//
//	the render order  a person's line must never cut a streamed block in two
//	the key           cmd+enter waits when plain enter would steer immediately
//
// Every assertion below reads what a person would see or what the session was
// actually told, never the shape of the code between them.

// streaming is an app with one turn open and one paragraph of it already on
// screen. The agent holds the live channel, so it behaves exactly as a real one
// does mid-turn.
