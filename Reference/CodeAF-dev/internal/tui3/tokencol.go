// THE DEFECT THIS FIXES: a running turn draws one still line, and that line
// claims exactly as much at second one as at second forty. The shimmer says
// "alive"; the caption says what the work is about; neither says whether
// anything is MOVING — and a person watching a slow endpoint, a long think or a
// stalled stream cannot tell the three apart. The pulse already learned to name
// what it is waiting for (render.go's [app.waitingWords]); this is the other
// half of the same question, and it is the half a number answers better than a
// sentence: how big is what is going up, how much has come back, right now.
//
// WHAT THE TWO FIGURES MEAN, AND WHERE EACH OF THEM COMES FROM.
//
//	↑  the weight of the request    The conversation's context — what the next
//	   IN FLIGHT.                   request carries whole: the system prompt,
//	                                every message, every tool result. It is
//	                                [session.Agent.ContextTokens] read through
//	                                [app.measureContext] and the usage beat, so
//	                                it steps up when a step's usage lands and
//	                                again when a tool result joins.
//	↓  what this work has           The books' output, plus an estimate of what
//	   RECEIVED.                    has arrived on the page SINCE those books
//	                                last moved — prose, reasoning, and the
//	                                arguments of calls still streaming in.
//
// ↑ USED TO BE THE BILL, AND THE BILL IS THE WRONG FIGURE FOR THIS COLUMN. It
// was the input the provider charged, summed over every request of the turn, so
// three steps on a 50k conversation read 150k — a number that answers "what
// have I paid for" (the status line's question, and /cost's) with a figure
// shaped like "how big is this", and which nobody could reconcile with anything
// else on the screen. The weight of the request is the figure a person reads
// the column for: it is what is being SENT, and it grows exactly when the
// conversation does. Spend stays where it always was.
//
// ↓ IS THE BOOKS PLUS WHAT IS NEW SINCE THEM, NEVER THE LARGER OF THE TWO. The
// first cut drew max(books, estimate of the whole turn), and the moment a bill
// counted tokens the page never showed — a call's arguments, hidden reasoning,
// the error in a four-bytes-to-the-token guess — the estimate sat under the
// books and ↓ STOOD STILL until the prose caught up, which on a turn of tool
// calls is never. So every page remembers how much of its writing it had when
// the books last moved ([tokenCol.bill]), and draws the books plus an estimate
// of only what arrived after. The whole-turn estimate stays as the floor for a
// page whose books have not said anything yet.
//
// A CALL'S ARGUMENTS ARE THE MODEL'S WRITING TOO. A `write` or a `propose_task`
// streams its body for seconds, and the provider bills every byte of it as
// output; a count of prose alone froze ↓ for exactly as long as the model was
// writing hardest, then leapt when the bill landed. The forming row already
// carries the size of what has arrived (feed.go's [feed.formTool]), and
// [modelWrote] counts it.
//
// ONE COLUMN, EVERY PAGE THAT STREAMS. The state lives on [feed] — the ONE
// reducer both the conversation and a task room grow their transcripts with
// (feed.go, and docs/design/lens/DESIGN.md's Decision 1 on why there is not a
// second one) — so a node's page draws the same column by the same code, from
// its own sources:
//
//   - the conversation's books are the session's, turn-scoped (app.go's
//     [app.take]), and its weight is the conversation's own;
//   - a task room on THIS machine takes its books from the node's lane — the
//     sum of the steps the lane has heard, as its bill is counted
//     ([taskNode.liveCost]) — and its weight from the node's own worker
//     ([taskWeightDoor]), asked on the same beat as the conversation's;
//   - a task room on ANOTHER machine has no lane at all (room.go's
//     [app.openFarRoom]), so it reads both off the node's journal, which banks
//     one line per request ([session.RequestBooks]): ↑ is the newest request as
//     it was sent, ↓ the output of every request in the tail the page read.
//
// In a room ↑ is ALWAYS ONE REQUEST, NEVER A SUM, for the conversation's
// reason. Where a page knows nothing yet — a node that was already running when
// the room opened and has not asked anything since — the figure is absent,
// which is the emptiness law and not a gap. Every page reaches the drawing
// through [deck.col]; a page with no column to carry (a run's read-only
// transcript, roomorch.go) leaves it nil and draws nothing.
//
// A ROW CARRIES THE FIGURES OF THE WORK IT STANDS FOR. That is the whole of the
// hierarchy and there is no other rule in it:
//
//   - the compact block's live row, and the door that replaces it when the
//     block is open, stand for THE WHOLE RUNNING TURN, and carry the pair
//     (livesteps.go);
//   - a step's own caption row, drawn inside an opened block, stands for THAT
//     STEP, and carries only ↓ — what the model wrote inside it (caption.go).
//     A step's share of what went UP is not attributable: a request carries the
//     whole conversation, not the step it happens to be in, and a figure that
//     divided it between steps would be arithmetic nobody performed.
//
// A ROW THAT HAS FINISHED CARRIES NOTHING. The column is a sign of motion, so
// it lives exactly as long as the motion does: a settled step drops its figure,
// and the whole column goes with the turn — this is the owner's ruling, and the
// session's totals are the status line's, which never go away.
//
// IT IS SPARE CELLS AND NEVER A RESERVATION. The words are the point of every
// row it lands on, so the column takes what is left at the right edge after the
// sentence has taken what it needs, exactly as the step clock does beside it
// (steptime.go) — no rewrap, no ellipsis, no fourth row. On a frame too narrow
// to hold all of it, the column sheds whole pieces in a fixed order (see
// [app.tokenColumn]), and on one too narrow for any of it the sentence wins.
//
// IT IS THE MARGIN'S INK, AND IT LIGHTS UP ONLY WHERE IT MOVED. The first cut
// painted the figures in the datum hue and they shouted; the second painted
// them dim and still, and a person could not tell a figure that had just moved
// from one that had been standing for a minute. So the RESTING column is the
// margin's tier every other right-edge fact wears (`41s`, `189 lines`), with the
// arrow one stop under its figure — and the side that has just moved GLOWS: its
// figure steps up to the reading ink and its arrow up one stop, then decays back
// through the palette's own ramp over [tokenGlowSpan] ([tokenGlow]). The two
// halves glow independently, so a person sees WHICH way the traffic is going.
// While a tool runs nothing moves, both halves rest dim, and that is the whole
// reading of "waiting, not dead": the shimmer says alive, the figures say quiet.
// AND ONLY GROWTH GLOWS: a figure that appears — a task page opened, a tab
// taken up — stands at its value, dim, at once ([chaseFigure]).
// A FIGURE THAT MOVES IS ALREADY SALIENT; the glow says only that it moved just
// now, and it is gone again before it can compete with the sentence.
//
// UNDER TEN THOUSAND EVERY TOKEN IS VISIBLE. A figure spelled `2.5k` changes
// once per hundred tokens, which on a slow stream is once every several seconds
// — exactly the stillness the column exists to rule out. So a column figure
// under 10,000 is spelled whole ([tokenColWord]); from there up it keeps
// [tokenWord]'s one decimal, where a hundred tokens is a rounding error and the
// glow carries the motion instead.
//
// AND A JUMP IN ↑ LEAVES A RECEIPT. When the request's weight steps up — a tool
// result joining, a step's usage landing — a faint `+3.4k` stands just left of
// the figure for [tokenReceiptSpan] and goes: the eased walk makes the jump
// legible, and the receipt says how big it was without anybody subtracting.
// It is the first thing a narrow row gives up.
//
// AND THE FIGURES EASE, on reveal.go's clock and curve, because THE ARRIVAL
// SHAPE IS NOT THE DRAWING SHAPE: output arrives in lumps and the books land a
// step at a time, and a figure that jumped four thousand tokens between two
// frames reads as a glitch where the same four thousand walked reads as work.
// The books stay exact — nothing here is rounded into them — and the drawn pair
// snaps the instant the work stops, along with every other meter on the surface.
// THE LINEAR TIER NEVER PACES ONE AND NEVER GLOWS ONE (tui3.go's
// Options.Linear): a reader hears the exact figure, not its animation.
