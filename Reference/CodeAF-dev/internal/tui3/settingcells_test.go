// ── THE TAB STRIP IS LAID OUT IN CELLS, NOT IN BYTES ────────────────────────
//
// [tabChipCols] measured `len(title)`, a count of bytes, while everything that
// reads it — [tabWindow]'s fit, [tabSpans]'s arithmetic, the band [sheetTabBar]
// paints under the open tab — is laid out in the columns a terminal draws. The
// two agree only while every tab title is ASCII, which they all are today; the
// moment one is not, the strip hides the wrong number of chips and a click
// lands on the neighbour of the tab it was aimed at.
//
// The titles below are the two ways the readings part company: a double-width
// rune, which weighs three bytes and draws two cells, and a combining accent,
// which weighs two bytes and draws none at all.

// cellTabs is the strip with one wide title and one combining one in it. The
// ASCII names stay so that the geometry under test is the real strip's — nine
// chips that do not fit eighty columns — and not a special case.

// functions under test read this one package variable and nothing else, so
// nothing outside them can see the change.

// existing tests slice the line as `[]rune`, which is right for ASCII, wrong by
