// ── WHAT `+` PUT DOWN, AND WHOSE IT WAS ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// The start page stands over whatever was on the frame, and `esc` puts that
// thing back. Both halves of that sentence have an owner in them: the page has a
// KIND, and a task has a CONVERSATION. An `esc` that remembered only a number
// got both wrong in the two places where a number is not enough — a run's page
// carries the id zero on purpose, and a task read out of somebody else's
// conversation carries an id this window very probably also uses.
//
// And the third promise the page makes is about a sentence rather than a page:
// the conversation you were in keeps its draft. These hold the door to that
// promise — the create may not CLOSE a conversation that is holding one.

// startDoor wires a lab window with a door onto new conversations and counts
// what it was asked for, so "opening and escaping made nothing" stays an
// assertion in every one of these.

// read this page as "there was nothing here" and dropped somebody's graph on the
