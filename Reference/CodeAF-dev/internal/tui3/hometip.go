// ── THE TIP ROW, AND HOME'S KEYS ROW ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The foot of either box is three rows: the tip, the rule, the keys.
//
//	                                  💡 /manual answers any question about codeaf ✕

//
// THE TIP IS RIGHT-ALIGNED OVER THE RULE, one cell in from the edge, directly
// above where the rule used to say the project (the owner's placing,
// 2026-09-22). It is led by a bulb and closed by a cross a pointer can press:
// the cross puts the tip away until the row next changes hands
// ([app.noticeDismiss]). The same bulb, tip and cross, laid out by the same
// function, stand over a conversation's project at the right end of its keys
// row (footswap.go's [app.hintRow]) once the person has been quiet there for
// [chatTipQuiet] (notice.go's THE CONVERSATION'S TIP).
//
// THE PROJECT IS ON THE KEYS ROW NOW, right-justified, and it is the keys that
// keep their room: the path gives up its right end, one ellipsis, where the
// keys leave it no room for the whole, and goes entirely where they leave it
// less than a word. On home it is still the door onto the folder chooser it
// was on the rule (placemouse.go's [app.placeTargetPress]), so its columns are
// recorded where they are drawn, on [app.homeDoor]'s bargain; a conversation's
// keys row does the same for its own workspace (footswap.go's [app.hintRow]).

// homeTipLead is the bulb before a tip on the row.
//
// IT IS AN EMOJI, AND THAT IS THE OWNER'S RULING (2026-09-22) against the
// vocabulary's own no-emoji-in-chrome law (internal/tui2/tokens's glyph.go):
// one bulb, on one row, asked for by name. It is not a slot in the vocabulary
// because the vocabulary refuses the emoji planes on purpose and its width
// gate would refuse this one; and it is not the icon law's to own, because the
// law owns the vocabulary's runes and no other. It measures two cells
// everywhere the renderer measures, and the row is laid out from that
// measurement rather than from a guess.
const homeTipLead = "💡"

// homeTipGap is the cell between the bulb and the tip, and between the tip and
// its cross.
const homeTipGap = " "

// homeTipFloor is the fewest cells of tip worth drawing beside the bulb and
// the cross: under it the row says nothing, because a bulb beside three
// letters and an ellipsis is a row that teaches nothing.

// homeFootPathFloor is the fewest cells of path worth drawing after
// `project: ` on a keys row — the root and an ellipsis, or nothing.

// tipLine lays the tip row out: the bulb, the tip, the cross, right-aligned
// to end one cell in from the right edge. It reports the cross's columns, for
// the press, and an empty line where the frame is too narrow for the row to
// say anything.
