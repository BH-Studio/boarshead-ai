package tui3

// A PREVIEW, DRAWN — AND NOTHING ELSE IN THIS FILE TOUCHES A DISK.
//
// contextpreview.go reads a file into a [filePreview], which carries no palette,
// no width and no escape sequence. This file turns one of those into rows. The
// split is what makes the pane cheap and what makes it testable: a resize, a
// scroll, a theme change and a re-measured terminal all redraw from a value that
// is already in memory, and a test can pin exactly what a person sees without a
// fixture tree.
//
// EVERY FUNCTION HERE IS PURE. No app, no state, no clock. Give it a palette, a
// preview and a box and it answers the same rows every time.
//
// THE PANE IS A RECTANGLE AND NOTHING LEAVES IT. Every row is fitted to
// box.Width with [fit], which measures the way the renderer underneath composes
// its grid, and every line of somebody else's text was already stripped of
// escapes and control bytes on the way in ([previewLines]). A file cannot repaint
// the frame it is being previewed in.
//
// THE LAYOUT IS THE SCREENSHOT'S, ADAPTED. A body that fills the region, and one
// dim foot line stating what the thing is and what is not being shown — the
// limitation on the left, the facts on the right. Nothing else: no border, no
// title bar, no colour behind the pane [design-law: internal/tui is the visual
// north star].
