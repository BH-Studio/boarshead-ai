// THE COMMAND CHIP: a slash command does not look like a word.
//
// "/task" is not a noun in a sentence, and until this wave it was drawn as one
// — the same ink as the words either side of it, in the box and in the message
// after it was sent. A person who typed "/tsak" found out it was not a command
// from the answer, one keystroke too late, and a person who typed "/task" into
// the middle of a sentence had no way at all to tell that this surface even
// knew the word.
//
// So a RECOGNIZED command wears a background: the same tint the cursor's row
// wears elsewhere, behind exactly the cells the token already occupies
// ([palette.chip]). It is the smallest mark that says "this is a specifier, not
// prose" — no brackets, no border, nothing added to the line.
//
// TWO LAWS HOLD THE WHOLE THING UP.
//
// The first is that A CHIP ADDS NO CELLS. It is a repaint of the runes that are
// already there and never a space of padding around them, because the composer
// counts the caret's column off the draft's own runes (input.go's
// [caretColumnIn]): a chip a cell wider than its token would put the caret in
// the wrong place on every row that held one.
//
// The second is that ONLY A COMMAND THIS SURFACE RUNS GETS ONE. The word is
// resolved through the one command table, aliases included ([canonicalCommand]),
// so "/task" and "/clear" are chipped and "/tsak" and "/Users" stay plain text.
// A chip on a word this surface would answer with "unknown command: /tsak" would
// be the surface promising something it is about to refuse.
//
// ── THE CHIP IS A RECOGNITION MARK ──
//
// A CHIP MARKS A WORD THIS SURFACE KNOWS: any recognized command, wherever it
// stands in the draft or the sent message. It no longer says "enter will act on
// this" — send still runs only a leading command, and still treats a send-door
// tag anywhere else as actionable (see [app.slashTagHint] and the door-only
// [editor.liveTags]). What it says is "this is a specifier, not prose", which
// is true of a command mentioned mid-sentence and is the promise a person
// reads when they are learning what this surface answers to. A person may make
// a live tag plain by pressing backspace immediately after it, and its chip
// leaves on that first press without deleting a letter.
//
// THE TWO TAG DOORS BOTH END WHERE A PERSON CAN SEE THEM. /standing raises its
// ratification card, and /task starts its work in the open — a started row and a
// task on the roster, one worker that can be stopped (issue #936 took the wait in
// front of it away, not the row). Pasted text cannot turn a tinted word into
// silent work, because a tag's promise is carried by [commandDoor] and the hint
// line, never by the tint alone.
