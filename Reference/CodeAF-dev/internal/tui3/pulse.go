// The program's name and the places on the left (topnav.go), and right-aligned
// on the other end, quiet unless it has a reason not to be, the machine's own
// vital signs. The first
// line is a conversation's and every place's; the second is home's, which leaves
// its counts to the panels under it (DESIGN.md's law 11, [pulseBudget]). It is the
// watch made visible (docs/HOME-BRIDGE.md): a person who has just sat down learns
// in one glance how many things are stopped on them, how many are moving, what
// the day has cost against what it is allowed, and what time it is, without
// reading a single row.
//
// THE WORDS AND THE ORDER ARE THE DESIGN'S, EXACTLY. The retained
// docs/design/home-rethink/FIDELITY.md item 2 records the owner's instruction
// for this line, and every clause below follows that record.
//
// ── THE LAWS ──
//
//   - THE MONEY ON THIS LINE IS THE MONEY ON THE SPEND PLACE, and it is ONE
//     FUNCTION rather than two that agree. Every segment comes off
//     [app.machine], and the day's figure inside it comes off the usage
//     ledger through [spendDayTotal] — the same arithmetic over the same rows that
//     draws `today $3.42 of $500` in the body of the spend place and `today` on
//     Settings→Spending. This line used to sum the task records hanging off home's
//     own world instead, so it drew `$1.85 / $500.00` over a spend place drawing
//     `today $0.13 of $500` on the same frame, and which of the two you were shown
//     depended on which rooms you had walked through. A top line that argues with
//     the body under it is worse than no top line.
//
//   - AND NO SEGMENT IS A FACT ABOUT A SCREEN. A place a person walked out of is
//     not a source of facts about the machine: the figures here are read from the
//     machine itself, ON A BEAT AND NEVER ON A DRAW (homemachine.go's
//     [app.readMachine]), and this line reads the memo that beat left behind.
//
//   - EVERY SEGMENT OBEYS THE EMPTINESS LAW. Nothing stopped on anybody draws no
//     `want you` clause — not `0 want you` — nothing in flight draws no `moving`,
//     and a day that has cost nothing says nothing about money. SCREEN 1c is that
//     law taken all the way and it is a real frame this file has to be able to
//     draw: a quiet morning is the name and the clock, and nothing else.
//
//   - THE CLOCK IS NEVER EMPTY AND IS ALWAYS THE FIRST TO GIVE WAY, which are
//     two different laws that used to be written as one. The time is never
//     absent and never zero, so on a screen with nothing else to say it is the
//     one segment left and it draws; but it is also the LOWEST-RANKED thing on
//     the line, and a frame too narrow for every segment sheds it before it
//     sheds a word about the machine. (What this law used to say was "THE CLOCK
//     ALWAYS DRAWS", and it was read as a width law as well as an emptiness law,
//     which is how sixty columns came to spend twelve cells on `thu 12:01am`
//     while the whole right end went unwritten.)
//
//   - THE LADDER IS THE NAV'S NOW (topnav.go's [app.navTails]). The line shares
//     its row with the places, and the owner ruled the order the row gives
//     things up in (2026-09-24): the clock, then the moving count, then the
//     words of `2 want you` (never its count), then the places fold, and the
//     day's figure is the last clause but one standing.
//
//   - AND THE COUNT THAT WANTS YOU NEVER LEAVES THE ROW. It was allowed to,
//     for one wave, on the argument that a place's own rows and the strip's
//     marks say it too; at eighty columns that left a conversation's frame
//     with no number anywhere on its top line for the things stopped on the
//     person reading it, which is the one fact a glance at this row is for.
//     So `2 want you` shortens to `2 ?` in the same amber before anything
//     else is given up, and it outlasts the money and the places.
//
//   - THE ALLOWANCE IS A FRACTION HERE, AND THE OWNER OVERRULED THIS FILE TO PUT
//     IT THERE. What stood here for four waves was the opposite law, and it read:
//     "NEVER A QUOTA FRACTION HERE. What the day has spent belongs on the pulse;
//     what the day is ALLOWED to spend is the machine card's `today` band and
//     nowhere else. A ceiling on this line would turn a glance into an arithmetic
//     problem." (That band is retired with home's resting state and this line is
//     the only one left that draws either figure.) The design draws
//     `$0.55 / $20.00`, the owner said "follow the
//     exact design" on 2026-08-25, and the old law is retired rather than quietly
//     dropped — this paragraph is its headstone. The argument it lost is worth
//     keeping: the fraction is two figures where one would do. The argument that
//     beat it is that "how much is left" is the only thing anybody ever wanted the
//     first figure FOR, and a person who has to remember their own ceiling to read
//     a spend segment is doing the arithmetic anyway, in their head, wrongly.
//
//   - AND THE FRACTION RETIRED THE COLOUR CHANGE THAT STOOD IN FOR IT. The figure
//     used to rise out of the dim into the warning hue as the bound came close,
//     because a glance could take that in without reading. It no longer does: the
//     bound is now ON THE LINE, in cells a person can read, and a figure that both
//     stated the ceiling and changed colour about it would be saying one thing
//     twice. [machineFacts.nearCeiling] is unmoved and still governs the `today`
//     band, which is the surface that has a ceiling to talk about at length.
