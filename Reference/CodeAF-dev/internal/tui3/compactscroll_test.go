// THE DEFECT THESE TESTS PIN: scrolling up in a resumed conversation stopped at
// the last compaction and pretended that was the beginning of the chat.
//
// The journal had every line of it. [app.backfill] paged through the SESSION's
// transcript, which starts after the latest marker, so the moment replayFrom hit
// zero the `· earlier · keep scrolling` marker went out and an hour of
// conversation was unreachable on a screen that looked complete.
//
// What is asserted here is the whole of the fix: the scroll runs through the
// boundary into the region above it, the marker stays honest until the real
// beginning, and the boundary itself is DRAWN — one dim line saying what it is,
// staying where it happened while the reader scrolls on past it.
