// ── WATCHING A CONVERSATION SOMEBODY ELSE IS TYPING INTO ────────────────────
//
// More than one window can be attached to one conversation on a far machine: a
// desk and a laptop, two rooms, or a person and the terminal they forgot to
// close. Until now every one of them had a composer, so two windows raced and
// neither screen said the other existed.
//
// THE KEYBOARD FOLLOWS THE NEWEST WINDOW, AND NOTHING IS EVER THROWN AWAY. The
// engine decides who holds it (internal/remote's driver.go) and this file is the
// half a person sees:
//
//   - The window that does not hold it becomes a WATCHER. Its transcript keeps
//     arriving live — that is the whole reason it is not simply closed, because
//     a forgotten window still showing the work is a feature — and where its
//     composer was, one dim line stands instead.
//   - `enter` takes the keyboard back, in one round trip on the connection that
//     was already open. The other window becomes the watcher in the same
//     instant, told by the engine rather than by discovering it on a keystroke.
//   - THE DRAFT IS KEPT. It is not cleared, not sent and not lost: the box is
//     not drawn, and the words are exactly where they were when the keyboard
//     comes back.
//
// WHY `enter` AND NOT THE FIRST KEYSTROKE. Taking the keyboard off another
// machine is a thing to mean, and the first keystroke is a thing a sleeve does.
// It is also a round trip: bound to a character key, the first letter of every
// sentence would race a wire call that can fail, and the letter would be the
// thing that got lost. `enter` is already this surface's "my turn to speak", and
// the line says so in the place a person is looking when they wonder.
//
// AND ALL OF IT IS ABSENT ON A LOCAL SESSION. There is no room to be a watcher
// in — a conversation open in a second window here is refused at the journal,
// with [sessionBusyWord] — so the seam is nil, [app.watching] is false, and not
// one row of this file is ever drawn.

// ── the keys ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// watchKey is the narrow thing a watcher's keyboard does differently, and it is
// deliberately narrow: EVERYTHING THAT READS STILL WORKS. Scrolling, copy mode,
// the places, a permission card, ctrl+c — a watcher is a person watching their
// own work, not a guest, and all of those are handled above this in the router
// ([app.key]) or fall through it untouched.
//
// What it takes is the two things that only make sense with a composer: the
// send keys, which become the take-back, and a character typed into a box that
// is not on the frame.
//
// THE DOOR HOME IS COUNTED HERE RATHER THAN LET THROUGH, and that is worth the
// four lines it costs. [app.homeGesture] reads two consecutive spaces out of the
// BOX, and this register has no box on the frame — so letting the space fall
// through while swallowing the letters turned a typed sentence into a run of
// spaces and opened home on the first word with two in it. Driven over a real
// connection, `this should be swallowed` walked straight out of the
// conversation. The gesture is the same gesture; it is simply counted where the
// keys actually are, and any other key ends the run exactly as a letter in the
// box would.
