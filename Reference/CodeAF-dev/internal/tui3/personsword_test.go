// WHAT THE SURFACE DOES WHEN A PERSON'S OWN WORD LET GO OF THE REQUEST.
//
// The engine cuts a request that has put nothing in front of anybody when the
// person names another model, and asks the same step again on theirs
// (internal/session's steer.go, THE PERSON'S WORD WINS). Two things are owed on
// this side of that, and until #935 the engine said nothing at all so neither
// happened: the clock the page is counting up belongs to a request that no
// longer exists and has to start again — it is the very `waiting · 13m 37s` the
// person spoke to be rid of — and anything the dead attempt drew has to come
// off, because the transcript no longer holds a word of it.

// personCut is the event the engine sends for it: a MOVE, with `Next` naming
// where the step is going, which is what every surface reads to tell a hop from
// a retry (session.RetryNews).
