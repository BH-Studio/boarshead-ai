// THE RECORD BESIDE THE LIST.
//
// The tasks place is a column of names. A name is what a person scans, and it is
// almost never what they came for: the questions they arrive with are "what did
// this do", "what did it cost", "where did it leave my files" and, on a row that
// is their call, "do I accept it". Every one of those used to cost a keypress
// into the record card, a read, and an `esc` back to a list they then had to find
// their place in again — so walking ten rows of a morning's work was ten opens.
//
// SO A WIDE FRAME SPLITS: the list keeps the left, a dim seam divides it, and the
// right is the cursor row's record, following the cursor. Nothing is opened and
// nothing is lost — enter still opens the full card, esc still comes back — and a
// person reading down the list reads the answers as they go.
//
// ── THE LAWS ──
//
//   - ONE FUNCTION DECIDES WHETHER THERE IS A PANE AT ALL ([taskPaneCols]).
//     Under [taskPaneFloor] the pane is ABSENT rather than blank and the list's
//     cursor row grows its own line instead; a second opinion about that width is
//     how a frame comes to draw a seam with nothing behind it.
//
//   - IT IS NOT A SECOND RENDERER. Every row it draws is built by the record's own
//     builders (taskrecord.go's `taskRecord…` half), so the pane and the card
//     cannot say two different things about one piece of work.
//
//   - THE SEAM IS THE ONE THIS SURFACE ALREADY DRAWS. [railSeam] is the rule the
//     roster and the room split on; DESIGN-LANGUAGE bans borders, and a second
//     spelling of one stroke would be a second border to keep in step.
//
//   - NOTHING ON THE DRAW PATH TOUCHES A DISK. The report under the title is read
//     off the loop, once per row, after the cursor has SETTLED — a held `↓` moving
//     thirty times a second fires no reads at all ([app.taskPaneFollow]) — and
//     what has been read is kept per row for as long as the place is open.
//
//   - UNTIL THE REPORT ARRIVES ITS SLOT IS EMPTY. The emptiness law applied to a
//     fact that is merely late: no spinner, no `loading`, and no row that appears
//     and then changes its mind.

// a frame and shorter than a glance: anything under a repeat interval would read
// a journal per row walked, and anything a person would NOTICE would make the
