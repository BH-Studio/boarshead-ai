// AN INTERLEAVED STREAM IS ONE THOUGHT AND ONE ANSWER, NOT A SAW BLADE.
//
// The report this file is written from: a subharness design thread on a model
// that puts reasoning and answer on the wire interleaved, a few tokens of each
// at a time. The surface treated every hand-off as a new phase — each reasoning
// delta closed the streaming reply and opened a fresh thinking block, so a
// single sentence arrived as "thre", a `thought for 0s · 2 tok` row, then "ad
// gets saved…", all the way down the page. The rule these tests pin: a text
// delta settles the thought block but does not let go of it, so the next
// reasoning delta grows the same block and the answer streams on unbroken; only
// a real boundary — a tool call, the turn ending — seals the block so a
// genuinely new stretch of thinking earns a row of its own.

// interleaved is the wire shape that broke: reasoning and answer alternating
// mid-word, then a settle.
