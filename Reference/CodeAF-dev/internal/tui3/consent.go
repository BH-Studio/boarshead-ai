// ── THE APPROVAL QUESTION ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// internal/session's consent.go decides that one tool call needs a person, and
// then BLOCKS that call until somebody answers. This file is what is left of
// the surface's half of that once the drawing moved.
//
//	  ╰─▶ bash rm -rf build
//	? needs your ok to run bash [1] allow once · [2] always, this command · [3] deny · [esc] later · 7s
//	  bash pattern "rm -rf *"
//	  2 more
//
// THE BLOCK DRAWS IT NOW (question.go), and everything about those four rows
// belongs to the block: the row it re-uses, the answers, the queue count, the
// narrow sheet, the clock, the keyboard and the receipt. docs/design/questions/
// DESIGN.md is why — one renderer for every decision this engine hands a
// person — and the 1388 lines that used to be here were the strongest argument
// for it, because every law they carried had to be argued again in eight other
// blocks that never got round to it.
//
// What is left is the three things that are the LANE'S and not the block's:
//
//   - THE ROW. The question is about a call the transcript has already drawn
//     (session sends the consent request AFTER the batch's EventToolBegin
//     rows), so this marks that row as stopped and draws one where a surface
//     that attached mid-batch has none. A question about a call nobody can see
//     is a question nobody can answer.
//   - THE WIDENING YES IS WRITTEN DOWN ([app.consentAnswered]) — the tool's
//     allow, or, for the one tool judged by its arguments, the SHAPE the person
//     picked out of the block's second beat. It is the only thing this surface
//     does that outlives the process, so it is the only thing it prints a
//     receipt for, and the receipt says where to undo it.
//   - THE READING CLOCK'S LENGTH, which is a setting ([app.consentWait]) and is
//     handed to the question when it is raised. What the clock DOES is the
//     block's ([app.tickQuestion]), and what it does is hold: silence is not a
//     no, and F41 — a hidden ~10s timer that recorded "denied" and killed work
//     nobody refused — is the reason that sentence is a law.
//
// After an answer the ROW STAYS, annotated dim with what was decided. The
// transcript is what happened, and "you were asked about this and said yes" is
// part of what happened — one of the few things this surface records that the
// session file never will (consent is events, never journal).

// askConsent takes one session.EventConsentRequest.
//
// It puts the call's row into the question state and raises the question on the
// block. THE SAME QUESTION ARRIVES TWICE ON PURPOSE: the engine also sends it
// whole on the questions lane ([session.Agent.WatchQuestions]), and the block
// replaces by token — so whichever gets here first draws, and the second is the
// same decision rather than a second one. What this one carries that the lane's
// cannot is everything below: the shapes, the write seam, the clock.
