// ── THE NAVIGATION HEADER: WHICH CONVERSATION THIS WINDOW HAS, AND WHICH ONE IS UP ──
//
// The frame's first row used to be ONE WORD — the conversation's own name, with
// a `▾` after it where the switcher had somewhere to go (roomcrumbs.go's bar,
// which this replaces). It answered "what is this page" and nothing else, so the
// other conversations a person had been in all day were reachable only through a
// keystroke they had to know about, and there was nowhere on screen that said
// they existed at all.
//
// So the top of the frame is a HEADER PANEL, and the number of rows in it is
// what page you are standing on:
//
//	 │ main ×│ the tree walk  │ chat three  │ +                +2   ← the tabs
//	 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────   ← the rule
//
//	 │ main ×│ the tree walk  │ chat three  │ +                +2   ← the tabs
//	 ─ main ▸ Ship the port ▸ Cut the goldens ──────── esc/← main ─  ← the trail
//	 ─ ⠿ working · 2m 12s · $0.04 · 6 tool calls ───────── Stop ───  ← the facts
//
// THE THREE ROWS ARE THREE QUESTIONS AND THAT IS WHY THEY ARE THREE ROWS. The
// tabs say WHICH CONVERSATION; the trail says WHERE INSIDE IT, and nothing else
// — no state glyph, no model, no money, because a path with telemetry threaded
// through it is a path nobody can read as a path; the facts row says WHAT THE
// WORK IS DOING and ends in the rule that separates the header from everything
// under it. Out in the conversation there is no trail and no facts — `main` with
// nothing after it is the tab above said twice — so the panel is the tabs and
// one low-contrast rule, which is what gives the transcript and the roster
// beside it an edge that does not depend on the terminal's own background.
//
// ── WHAT A TAB IS ALLOWED TO CLAIM ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A TAB IS A CONVERSATION THIS WINDOW HAS BEEN IN, and that is the whole of the
// claim. It is NOT a promise that the conversation is running: over a shared
// engine handle (`Options.SharedAgent`, which is every `--host` door and the
// ordinary socket onto this machine's own engine) the far side holds ONE
// conversation at a time and ends the previous one on the swap, and a strip
// drawing eight live sessions there would be the surface inventing seven of
// them. What is true in both worlds is that these are the conversations a person
// has been in from this window and can go back to in one press — which is what
// the browser tab it looks like promises too.
//
// ── AND THE ✕ ON A TAB CLOSES A VIEW, NEVER WORK ────────────────────────────
//
// This is the law the whole close gesture hangs off, and it is the opposite of
// what the strip used to say. Dismissing a tab TAKES THE TAB OFF THE ROW and
// does nothing else: the agent behind it goes on running, its draft, its caret
// and its attachments are kept exactly where the person left them, and the
// conversation is still on the switcher `alt+k` opens — which is where
// reopening it brings the tab, and the draft, back. Nothing on this row calls
// [app.closeFront] or [app.closeKept], and nothing on it interrupts an agent.
//
// So the mark can be drawn on every tab honestly, over a shared handle included:
// it is a claim about a ROW OF THIS WINDOW, and this window owns every one of
// them. Ending work is `Stop` on the facts row, spelled out in a word, and
// ending the program is `/quit` — two gestures a person types on purpose, and
// neither of them is a mark on a tab.
//
// ── AND WHY THE ORDER NEVER MOVES ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// [app.prev] is a RECENCY stack — the order `tab` walks and the switcher's own
// ring — and a strip drawn from it would re-order itself on every switch, which
// is the one thing tabs may not do: a person reaches for the position, not for
// the word. So the strip keeps its OWN list in the order each conversation was
// first entered ([app.chatTabs]), and recency decides only which tab is up and,
// when the list outgrows the cap, which one falls off the end.

const (
	// tabSep is the rule between two tabs. It is ONE CELL AND IT IS INERT: the
	// row is a set of padded targets and the separator is what tells them apart,
	// so it answers to no pointer and no press (the strip claims the row so a

	// pointer: a row that grew two cells when a hand crossed it would re-pack
	// every label beside it, and the tab somebody was reaching for would move
	// out from under them.
	//
	// THE AIR BEFORE THE MARK IS THE LABEL'S OWN PAD, so a tab is symmetric: the
	// inset, the status slot and the pad lead the name, and the pad, the mark

	// that said the other conversations existed at all. Neither is true now: the
	// legend under the box says `alt+k chats` wherever the card would open
	// (render.go's [hopDoorWord]), in the person's own keyboard's spelling, which
	// is a door that teaches the key rather than replacing it.

	// WHAT SURVIVES IS THE COUNT, BECAUSE THE COUNT IS A FACT AND NOT A DOOR.
