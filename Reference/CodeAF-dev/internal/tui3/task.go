// THE TASK SURFACE: A DECISION, AND THEN A PRESENCE.
//
// internal/session's task_contract.go says what a task IS — a node in a
// dynamically evolving DAG, of which v1 ships the degenerate one-node case —
// and this file is the two places that node touches a person:
//
//   - THE PROPOSAL IS A DECISION MOMENT, INLINE. It arrives mid-conversation,
//     it blocks the turn that raised it, and it is answered once. That is the
//     shape the consent question already has on this surface, so it takes the
//     consent grammar whole: the question hue (violet, the fifth colour, spent
//     nowhere else), the row that keeps its verdict afterwards, the keyboard
//     lane at the bottom of the screen. It is drawn in the TRANSCRIPT rather
//     than above the input because a proposal is part of what happened — the
//     model asked, you answered, the work started — and a modal that vanished
//     would leave the conversation unable to explain where a running node came
//     from.
//   - THE RUNNING NODE IS A STANDING PRESENCE, IN A RAIL. It outlives the turn
//     that proposed it: its "done" lands minutes later with no turn open and no
//     stream to land on. A transcript line cannot hold something that is still
//     true, so the right column holds it — one row per node, alive at the top,
//     gone when it has come home — and the transcript gets one dim line when it
//     lands. THE RAIL IS PRESENCE; THE NOTE IS HISTORY. Neither says the other's
//     half.
//
// THE RAIL IS TREE-READY AND THE TREE IS NOT DRAWN. v1's graph has no edges, so
// nothing here draws one — but every node carries its DependsOn, the row model
// stores it, and a node whose prerequisites are unmet renders v1's own sentence
// under it ("waits: collect sources", internal/tui's model_test.go). When edges
// arrive the shape is already in the model; what changes is how many rows have
// something to say.

// ── the two rows of state ───────────────────────────────────────────────────

// taskCard is one proposal, from the question to the verdict.
//
// It is a pointer held in two places — the transcript entry that draws it and
// [app.task], the lane that answers it — so the answer and the row can never
// disagree about what was decided.

		// asserting a present that is not happening, which is the one thing a row

		// the bill go on being the clock and the bill.

		// to the report" is news about the WORK and "rate limited" is news about

		// than as a clause per field, because they are one kind of thing: what is
		// true of this node RIGHT NOW. Anything that is none of that is the
		// duplicate this guard exists for.
		//
		// AND A NAME IS THE LOUDEST NEWS OF ALL. A notice that carries a title the
		// node does not have was thrown away here, and the row kept the only name
		// this surface can make without one — "task 19" ([taskTitleOf],
		// taskident.go) — for the whole of that node's life, on the column, on the
		// strip, in its room's header and on the card that landed. The states are
		// monotonic but the NAMING is not: a row can be published before its title
		// is known and again after, in the same state, and the second one is the
		// only chance this surface gets to learn what the work is called.
		//
		// AND A LANDING THAT CHANGED WHAT IT IS ASKING IS NEWS IN THE SAME STATE.
		// A node the model accepted whose merge was then REFUSED settles again as
		// `unverified` with a different merge word, a different file list and a
		// different road — a different question, with different answers, now the
		// person's — and a guard that only looked at the state threw that event
		// away, which is why the card in front of somebody kept asking the
		// question the first landing asked ([taskReasks], #767).

		// NOBODY MAY MISS. The floor hands an unanswered question back to the person
		// at the end of the model's turn by publishing a row whose state, span,
		// branch and report are all exactly what they were and whose only news is
		// [session.TaskNotice.Decider] — so a guard that only ever looked at the
		// state would throw away the event that puts the chips back on the card
		// somebody is waiting in front of (taskdone.go's [app.handedBackCard]).
		//
		// AND A PROGRAM THE NODE HAS NOT BEEN TOLD OF IS NEWS, on the brief's
		// terms: an empty one says nothing, and one the node already carries is the
