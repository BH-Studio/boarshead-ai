// WHAT THIS MACHINE HAS TO SAY ABOUT ITSELF, IN ONE READING.
//
// The pulse line at the top of every place says it in four clauses — how many
// things have stopped on a person, how many are in flight, what the day has
// cost, and the time (pulse.go) — and this file is where those numbers come
// from.
//
// IT USED TO FEED A CARD AS WELL. Home had a resting state: the cursor walked
// up off the top of the list onto no row at all, and the right-hand column
// became a card about the machine — what was keeping an eye on things, what had
// happened since you left, what the day had come to. That state is retired.
// `↑` off the top row reaches the TAB BAR now (pages.go's [barCursor]), which is
// a row a person can walk along and open a room from, and the three questions
// the card answered each have a room of their own on that bar: standing, the
// `since you left` lines home draws in its own list, and spend. So the facts
// stayed and the second surface went, which is one reading feeding one line
// rather than one reading feeding two things that could drift apart.
//
// ── AND IT NEVER BLOCKS, AND A DRAW NEVER TAKES IT ──
//
// The reading is taken on a beat and at a door — home's three-second beat and
// every place's ([homeEvery]), the pulse's own ten-second beat while no home is
// open (pulsebeat.go), and [app.showPage] on the way into any room — and left
// in [app.machine]. The pulse is drawn on every frame and reads that memo and
// nothing else, so a frame costs no file, however often it is painted.

	// IT IS [machineFacts.hands]' MIRROR AND IS COUNTED THE SAME WAY, off the same
	// three worlds in the same walk ([machineCounts]). The two are the whole
	// of the switcher's sort order said as two numbers — SCREEN 2b ranks the one

// the task records under home's own world and add the standing ledger to them,
// which was a THIRD accounting of money the ledger already holds: the top line
// drew `$1.85 / $500.00` over a spend place drawing `today $0.13 of $500` on the
// same frame, fourteen times apart against one denominator, and a person could
// not tell which of the two was their bill. The ledger is the only reading that
// sees every call — internal/session writes a row as each call's bill is
// decoded, interrupted turns included (docs/changes/unreleased's
// 290-one-ledger-one-number) — so the second reading is gone rather than made to
// agree, because two readings that agree today are two readings that disagree
// later.
