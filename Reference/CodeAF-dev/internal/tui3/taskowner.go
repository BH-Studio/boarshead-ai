// WHO OWNS ONE PIECE OF WORK, AND HOW THIS WINDOW REACHES THEM.
//
// Every row on the tasks place belongs to a CONVERSATION — the pair
// [session.TaskIndexEntry] identifies a row by is that conversation and the id
// inside it, because ids restart with every conversation. Until this file the
// surface asked one question about that pair ("is it mine?") and answered
// everything else with a read-only card. That is right for work whose
// conversation closed months ago and wrong for the rows a person actually
// presses, which are the ones happening right now.
//
// THE LANE INTO THOSE ROWS ALREADY EXISTS, AND `codeaf chat` IS ALREADY ON IT.
// The ordinary local launch is a SURFACE talking to this workspace's engine over
// a unix socket (cmd/codeaf's chatv3_local.go: `remote.Roam("", …)` with an
// empty machine label, dialling [enginehost.Attach]). The engine keys its
// conversations by [remote.Hello.Session], and a second hello carrying the same
// key is handed THE SAME LIVE SESSION rather than a new one — that is the whole
// of internal/enginehost's Host.open, and internal/remote has served several
// surfaces onto one conversation since version 2. So the task page can dial the
// engine it is already talking to, say which conversation, read that task's
// journal, and give the connection back — without restarting the work, moving
// it, or taking it off the window that owns it.
//
// FOUR REACHES, IN ORDER OF CERTAINTY, and every rung is a fact this surface
// already keeps rather than a new reading:
//
//   - HERE — the conversation on screen. Its live node has a room, as it always
//     did.
//   - OPEN — a conversation THIS PROCESS holds and is not drawing (keeper.go).
//     Reaching it is a switch, not an open: nothing is resumed, nothing is
//     closed, and both conversations go on running.
//   - ATTACH — a conversation the ENGINE is running that this window can join
//     as a second view ([Options.OpenTaskOwner]). The page is that task's own
//     transcript, live, with `esc` back to where the person was — or, for a
//     task handed to a program, which writes no transcript, the program's
//     actions off the owner's store ([app.guestPageRead]).
//
// AND WHERE THERE IS NO REACH AT ALL — no capability, an engine that refused, a
// conversation on no list this machine keeps — the card says the one short thing
// that is true. It does not claim the work is fine and does not promise where it
// will end up: this window cannot see either.
//
// THERE IS NO RUNG FOR "OPEN THE TRANSCRIPT INSTEAD", and its absence is a
// decision. Work that has LANDED already opens the card, which is the page that
// answers what a person came to a record row asking; work that is running is in
// a process that holds that transcript's lock, so opening the file would be
// refused by the flock even if the ladder tried. The row that owns this file's
// four rungs is the running one.
//
// A view attaches as a watcher ([remote.Hello.Watch]). The engine refuses that
// connection the keyboard even when it is unclaimed, and the page shows that it
// is reading. The view cannot steer or stop work in either conversation.
