// THE BRIDGE: HOW WIDE HOME HAS TO BE BEFORE IT DRAWS A CARD.
//
// Everything this file arranges was built somewhere else. The list is
// switcher.go's flat ranked reading (place_home.go wires it), the pulse over the
// top is pulse.go's, the frame around all of it is the router's (pages.go), and
// the card on the right is the band registry's (homebands.go). What is here is
// the ARRANGEMENT — where each of them stands at which width, and the one cell
// on the whole page that is allowed to move (homespinner.go).

//
// ── THE LAWS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   - ONE COLUMN, AND A SECOND ONE ONLY WHEN THE WIDTH IS REALLY THERE. The
//     zones' column and the everyday card tier both went with the strips: at
//     every ordinary width the right-hand note on each row carries the one fact
//     the card was for, and a card drawn beside it was showing a person what
//     pressing enter shows a beat later (SCREEN 1a). Past [homeCardMin] the
//     width is genuinely spare, and there the card is not a preview but a thing
//     that ACTS — a question you can answer without opening anything (SCREEN
//     1d).
//
//   - THE LADDER IS ONE DECISION, TAKEN ONCE PER WIDTH. [homeTierAt] is the only
//     place a number is compared, and [app.homeFrame] settles it beside the
//     phone tier's own — before the column is built, because the shape decides
//     what the column HOLDS and a flag settled at the draw would build one shape
//     and paint another.
//
//   - NO BORDERS, AND THE COLUMNS ARE MADE OF ALIGNMENT. The gutter is the same
//     four cells the card has always been separated by ([homeGutter]), drawn on
//     every row whether or not the column to its left had anything to say, so
//     each column's edge is a straight line the eye can find. This surface draws
//     no rules but the two the frame already had.

// ── the ladder ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// homeTier is which of home's two shapes a frame is wide enough for. The
// phone's own inbox is a third shape and is decided by [layoutTier], which is
// the whole program's breakpoint table; this ladder is home's own, and the two
// are settled in the same breath ([app.homeFrame]).
type homeTier int

const (
	// homeTierList is home at every ordinary width: the switcher takes the whole
	// frame and there is no card at all (SCREEN 1a and 1c).
	homeTierList homeTier = iota
	// homeTierCard is the wide frame: the list keeps everything it wants and the
	// card stands beside it, acting rather than previewing (SCREEN 1d).
	homeTierCard
)

// homeCardCol is what a card needs to stay a card. Under it the bands start
// giving their clauses up to each other, and a card that cannot say a whole
// sentence is a preview nobody reads.
const homeCardCol = 36

// homeSwitchName is the longest conversation NAME this list undertakes to draw
// whole beside its facts. Seventy cells is a sentence of a title — far past what
// a session names itself and past what most people type — and the law it serves
// is rowfit.go's first: the identity is whole before any fact gets a cell, so
// what this number buys is that the drop ladder never has to reach the title.
const homeSwitchName = 70

// homeSwitchTail is what a row spends on everything BUT its name at that
// reading: the mark and the two cells after it, then a project tag and an age,
// each carrying the one space a row puts in front of a fact.
const homeSwitchTail = 1 + 2 + (1 + 18) + (1 + 3)

// homeSwitchFull is the width at which the flat list stops wanting cells — the
// baseline SCREEN 1a is drawn at, where a row can carry its mark, its name, its
// project tag and its age with none of them giving way.
//
// THE NOTE IS NOT IN THAT LIST, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE OF THIS NUMBER. It was
// 120, which was this same reading WITH the row's note on it — the `asks: May I
// re-run the typecheck job…` clause — and that put [homeCardMin] at a hundred
// and sixty, so no ordinary window ever drew a card. The arithmetic was honest
// and the input was not: the note is THE FACT THE CARD EXISTS TO CARRY, and
// reserving the list's width for it meant the layout held cells back from the
// card in order to draw, in the list, the sentence the card would have drawn
// properly. A 120- and a 140-column window got neither.
//
// So the note is not what the list is measured at. It is ranked first out of the
// row, before the project tag and the age, which is the mechanism for this: past
// [homeCardMin] the note gives way and the card takes it up, and the name, the
// tag and the age are untouched at every width the tier exists at.
const homeSwitchFull = homeSwitchName + homeSwitchTail

// homeCardMin is the width at which a card appears beside the list — WHICH IS
// THE SUM OF THE TWO COLUMNS AND THE GUTTER, and not a number chosen next to
// them. A hundred and thirty-six cells is where the list has everything it asks
// for AND a card still fits; the tier begins exactly there because that is what
// the parts add up to, and it moves by itself the day one of them changes.
//
// THE CARD IS NOT PAID FOR OUT OF THE LIST. Below this the list would have to
// give up a fact its own ladder ranks above the note — the project tag, the age,
// or the name itself — to make room for a card, which is the layout arguing with
// itself. The NOTE is a different matter and is exactly what changes hands here:
// see [homeSwitchFull].
const homeCardMin = homeSwitchFull + homeGutter + homeCardCol

// homeCardCap is the widest the card is drawn.
//
// IT WAS FORTY-EIGHT AND THE CARD WAS DEMONSTRABLY CUT OFF THERE. On a
// two-hundred-column terminal the list was holding a hundred and forty-eight
// cells — twenty-eight more than it asks for ([homeSwitchFull]) — while the card
// beside it drew `→ verbs: put it away, new chat here, open folde…` and cut the
// sentence under a failed task mid-clause. A card that ends in an ellipsis over
// the thing it was about to offer is not a card with all the room it will ever
// ask for, whatever the number next to it said.
//
// THE GIVE-WAY RULE IS THE ARITHMETIC AND NOT THE CAP. The list keeps HALF of
// every cell past [homeCardMin] ([homeColumns]), so its share is
// `width/2 + 40` and is at [homeSwitchFull] or above at every width the tier
// exists at — by construction, at any cap. Raising this number therefore never
// takes a cell from the list; it only decides how many of the card's OWN half it
// is allowed to keep. Fifty-six is a comfortable measure for the clauses the
// card actually draws, it is reached at two hundred columns where the list still
// holds a hundred and forty-four, and past it the cells do more good in the list
// — which is the same argument [homeSwitchFull] makes from the other end.

// where am I. So the selection is on screen from the first frame, and there is
