// ── ctrl+shift+t PUTS THE LAST TAB BACK ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// This file holds the claim [app.reopenTabKey] makes — that the chord undoes the
// last `ctrl+w`, again and again, in reverse — and the ways it could quietly stop
// being true: that it never fabricates a conversation, that it skips a tab
// somebody already brought back by hand, that leaning on it cannot reopen one
// conversation twice in a row, that `ctrl+t` is untouched, and that the new-chat
// page is deliberately not on the stack at all.

// reopenPress is the chord as a terminal that can spell it sends it. It is built
// from the fields rather than through the suite's own `key` helper, because a
// shifted control key is exactly the event that helper has no spelling for — and
// what this whole feature hangs off is that the terminal CAN tell it from ctrl+t.
