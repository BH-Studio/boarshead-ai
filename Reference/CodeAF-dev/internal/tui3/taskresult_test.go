// ── WHAT AN OPEN LANDED CARD SAYS, AND IN WHAT ORDER ────────────────────────
//
// THE DEFECT, FROM A REAL CARD (2026-09-07). A ten-chapter story landed, its
// branch would not merge, somebody took it as done, and the expansion drew ONE
// DIM WALL in composition order: the merge refusal, git's own error, the
// sentence recording the decision, the words "finished, but needs your look"
// from before that decision, the file count, the branch, the model, the price,
// the span — and then, at the bottom and still in its markdown source, the
// story. Everything at one weight, in one hue, with the thing the person
// delegated the work for last.
//
// The card read ONE FIELD. internal/session has kept the landing's own story and
// what the work produced apart since task_result.go — the report is rewritten by
// every accept, verdict and refused merge that happens to a node afterwards,
// while the result never moves — and this card had never read the second one.
//
// These are the rules the split lands under.

// doneResultApp is one landed node with an answer of its own, at a stated width.
