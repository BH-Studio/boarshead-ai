// working while it is open. These tests drive the owner's report of 2026-09-24
// through the surface's own Update loop: open senior-dev's task by every door a
// person has onto it, then leave it by `esc`, by a press on the conversation's
// tab, and by a press on Home, and read what the FRAME shows after each — how
// many tabs are drawn selected, whether Home is on the bar, and whether the
// program's page is still covering whatever the press chose (tabbar_test.go
// holds the readings and the ordinary room they are held against).
