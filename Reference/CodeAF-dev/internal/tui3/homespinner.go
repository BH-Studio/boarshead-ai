// THE ONE SPINNER.
//
// However many things are moving on this machine, EXACTLY ONE ROW ANIMATES —
// the most recently active — and every other live row holds a still `●`
// (docs/HOME-BRIDGE.md). It is two promises at once, and they happen to be the
// same promise:
//
//   - CALM. A dashboard is a page somebody glances at, and eleven braille cells
//     turning at thirty frames a second in three columns is a page that cannot
//     be glanced at. One moving cell says "this machine is working" exactly as
//     well as eleven do, and it says it without taking the eye off whatever the
//     person came to read.
//
//   - A FLAT WIRE. Home is a still page on a three-second beat ([homeEvery]) and
//     the paint clock is woken only while something genuinely moves
//     ([app.homeAnimating]). What that clock costs over SSH is the frame it
//     redraws, and a frame with one turning cell in it is the same frame however
//     busy the machine gets — so a machine with twenty tasks out costs the wire
//     exactly what a machine with one costs.
//
// ── WHICH ROW ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// IT IS THE MOST RECENTLY ACTIVE ROW, which is the one order a person can
// verify: the thing that started last is the thing they just did, and a spinner
// that lands on it is the screen acknowledging the keystroke they are still
// thinking about. It is deliberately NOT the top of the list — the list is
// ranked by what wants a person first ([readSwitcher]) — because the top row and
// the moving cell answer two different questions, and neither is the other's
// summary.
