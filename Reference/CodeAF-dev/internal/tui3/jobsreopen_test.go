// A CONVERSATION REOPENED REDRAWS THE JOBS IT RAN.
//
// The engine keeps its half of that promise: waking a checkpointed conversation
// replays every restored job row onto the standing lane as a
// [session.EventJobUpdate] (session's task_run.go). The surface used to throw
// them away — [app.taskEvent]'s switch had no case for the kind — so a developer
// who left a dev server and a build running yesterday came back to a column that
// said they never ran, and because the section is the ONLY door to a job's page
// there was no way left to read the log.
//
// These cases pin the routing, which is the only piece that was missing: the
// reducer (jobstate.go), the state and the drawing (jobsview.go) were all there
// and all tested.
