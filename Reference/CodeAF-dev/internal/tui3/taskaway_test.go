// each other: a task started in the first appeared on no surface of the second,
// and a task some window was killed in the middle of went on claiming `running`
// in the shared file forever with nobody left to correct it. These are the whole
// of the fix — the history page draws the other windows' work, every record row
// has its claim of running judged against what those windows actually say, and
// the roster's own tree is left exactly as it was.

// awayFake is a surface's agent that also answers "what do the other windows
// have out", and counts how many times it was asked — which is the whole of the
// cache's claim ([app.refreshElsewhere]).
