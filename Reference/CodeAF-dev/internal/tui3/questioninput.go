// THE FOUR SHAPES BELOW A QUESTION, which is rung six of the ladder:
// "structured input — blanks · checklist · this-or-this · dial, never free text
// where a key would do" (docs/design/questions/DESIGN.md).
//
// WHY THE RUNG EXISTS AT ALL. A question whose answer is "postgres, port 5432,
// keep the old file" asked as free text is a question the model has to parse,
// and it parses it wrong roughly as often as a person types it differently from
// how they said it last time. Every shape here turns that into keys: a hole with
// a kind that validates it, a row that ticks, a pair that has exactly two sides,
// a dial with a sentence under it saying what the setting DOES. The answer that
// comes back is structured because the input was, not because anything guessed.
//
// ── THE ROWS, DRAWN HERE SO THEY STAY TRUE ──
//
// blanks, at 100 columns, the second hole focused. A choice hole wears the
// disclosure mark and a hole that takes anything does not, so the two are told
// apart without a legend:
//
//	  land them in [ ~/notes ] as [ a new file ] and keep the old copy: [ no ▾ ]
//	  name · anything you like
//
// checklist, after `a` took the suggestion and `shift+↑` lifted the second row:
//
//	  everything ticked goes in one commit.
//	  ✓ 2 move the tests beside them
//	  ✓ 1 rewrite the imports
//	    3 delete the old package
//	    4 rename the module
//
// pairs — one at a time, because a person answers a pair in a quarter second and
// a page of them is a page nobody finishes:
//
//	  which matters more here?
//	  speed against completeness
//	  a  finishing tonight    b  keeping every old row
//	  1 of 3
//
// dial:
//
//	  for questions in this project
//	  ask me everything · [tell me, then act] · just do it
//	  tell me, then act
//
// The reader tier never draws a dial as a picture — DESIGN.md: "the reader tier
// never draws a dial (a number input instead)" — so at that tier the middle row
// is `2 of 3 · tell me, then act` and the keys still move it.

// answer to it.
