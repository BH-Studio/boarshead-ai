// ── BRINGING THE MANAGER INTO THE PANE ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// The pane hosts the selected team's manager only while that conversation is
// the one in front ([app.teamsHosting]); everything here is how it gets there,
// and what the pane says while it does not.
//
// THE PANE USED TO SAY `opening ◆ prism's manager…` WHENEVER THE MANAGER WAS NOT
// IN FRONT, whether or not anything was opening it. The one attempt was made by
// [app.teamsBringManager] on the page's own doors (opening the page, choosing a
// team, a close and a reopen), and every other road to the same state made
// none: the teams arriving from the disk after the page opened, a manager set
// on the file by a session, a message handed to the hosted conversation that
// moved the front (a press on a Traffic row), a refusal that went to a line the
// pane does not draw. Each of them left the word on the pane with nothing
// behind it, and the owner watched it for as long as he looked (2026-09-24).
// And the attempt that did run went through the switcher's own door, which
// ends by stepping off whatever place is standing ([app.hopLand]): a manager
// this window was not holding was opened and the person was taken off the page
// to it.
//
// SO AN ATTEMPT IS NOW A THING THE PAGE HOLDS ([teamsOpen]), and the word on the
// pane is read off it rather than off the front. [app.teamsSync], which runs
// after every message, starts one whenever the selected team's manager is not
// in front and no attempt has been made for it, so no road can leave the pane
// waiting on nothing. The open is asked off the loop and lands the manager
// behind, then brings it forward only if the page still wants it, so the
// person never leaves the page for it. And the pane never waits silently: a
// refusal is said with its reason, an attempt the engine has not answered
// within [teamsOpenBound] is said too, and both offer `Retry` and
// `Open in chats` (the chat surface's own door, [app.trafficGo]). A manager
// whose transcript is gone offers `+ Manager`, which makes a new one.
//
// ONE OPEN PER MANAGER IS OUT AT A TIME. A team chosen twice (a double press, or
// away and back while the first open was on the wire) used to ask the door
// twice for the same transcript. The first answer came back as a stale attempt
// and was put behind, the second met the first one's lock, and the pane said
// the conversation was open in another window, about a conversation this window
// was holding, until the person pressed Retry. Now a choice while an open is
// out takes that open up as its own ([teamsOpenOut]), an answer for the manager
// the page is asking about is the page's answer whichever attempt it was, and a
// refusal about a conversation this window already holds is no refusal. `Retry`
// alone asks again while an open is out, because it is pressed when that open
// has not answered.
//
// AND THE DOOR IS NEVER ASKED FROM UPDATE. Over a connection that holds one
// conversation at a time the open is the engine's swap; it was made on the
// loop, and the window froze for the round trip. It goes through the ordered
// door line now ([app.offLoop]), because a swap is a gesture whose order
// matters, and the swap is taken when it answers.

// teamsOpenBound is how long the pane says `opening` before it says the engine
// has not answered. Long enough for an ordinary open over the socket, short
// enough that a person is not left looking at a word with nothing behind it.

// the disk any more.
