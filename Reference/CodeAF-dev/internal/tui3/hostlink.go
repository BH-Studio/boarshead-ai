// ── THE LINK TO THE MACHINE THE CONVERSATION IS ON ──────────────────────────
//
// host.go says the MACHINE is shown as the place; this file says what the link
// itself can honestly add: a measured round trip while it is healthy, the
// reconnecting condition while it is not, and news or waiting questions when
// it comes back.
//
// Do not confuse this with link.go, which is about the terminal READING this
// surface being on the far side of an ssh — a different link, a different fact,
// and one that only ever changes how often a frame is drawn. This one is the
// pipe `--host` opens to the engine, and internal/remote redials it for up to
// five minutes without telling anybody (its redial.go).
//
// FOUR THINGS CROSS AND EACH HAS A DIFFERENT LIFE:
//
//	the note      a CONDITION, true right now and false a second later, so it
//	              is a status-line segment and nothing else. It is asked on the
//	              frame, so it must answer from what is already held.
//	the ping      a MEASUREMENT, one empty round trip on a slow clock. Its
//	              rolling answer is cached before the frame reads it.
//	the notice    NEWS, once — the engine did not keep the turn, or it came back
//	              with a different conversation open. It is an ordinary note in
//	              the transcript, which is where every one-off sentence this
//	              surface says already lands ([Options.Notice] takes the same
//	              road on the first frame).
//	a held card   a QUESTION that was raised while nobody was here. It is not a
//	              new kind of card: it is the card this surface would have drawn
//	              live, replayed through the same door.
//
// AND ALL FOUR ARE ABSENT ON A LOCAL SESSION, because there is no link to have
// anything to say about — a capability that cannot work is absent, not broken.

// LinkSeam is what a door that opened this conversation over a connection can
// tell the surface about that connection.
//
// It is functions rather than a handle for [StandingSeam]'s reason: the door
// owns what the link IS and this package owns what a person reads, and a test
// of "what does the status line say while it is reconnecting" should be a
// string handed over rather than a pipe torn in half.
//
// The zero value is a surface with no connection to report — every local
// session, every test, and every headless frame. Nothing half-works there: no
// segment is drawn, no notice is looked for, and no question is asked about.
type LinkSeam struct {
	// Note is the quiet true sentence about the link right now, and the empty
	// string whenever there is nothing to say — which is almost always. It
	// reads `reconnecting to devbox — trying for up to 5 minutes` while a
	// dropped link is being redialled (internal/remote's [Client.LinkNote]).
	//
	// IT IS ASKED ON THE DRAW PATH AND MUST ANSWER IMMEDIATELY. The status row
	// is laid out twice per frame and the frame turns thirty times a second, so
	// a Note that reached for the wire would be a terminal that stopped
	// repainting for as long as the far machine took to answer — on a link that
	// had just died, ten seconds per frame ([hostStanding] in cmd/codeaf states
	// the whole of that law about its own seam, and keeps a cache to obey it).
	//
	// This one needs no cache, and that is a fact about the client rather than
	// a hope: the sentence is built from a field the redial loop has already
	// set, under the mutex that guards it, with nothing on the wire behind it.
	// A door that wired something slower here would be wiring a different law.
	Note func() string

	// Ping measures one empty call to the far machine and back. It is asked on
	// this file's own slow clock, never while a frame is being assembled and

	Ping func() (time.Duration, error)

	// Notice is one sentence to show once and then forget, and the empty string
	// when there is none.
	//
	// IT DRAINS, so it is read from exactly one place ([app.takeLinkNotice],
	// called at the top of [app.Update] and nowhere else). A second reader

	//
	// AN ERROR IS AN ERROR AND NOT AN EMPTY LIST, which is the shape
	// internal/remote hands over: "nothing is waiting" and "the far end did not
	// answer" are different facts, and a surface that drew the second as the
	// first would be quietly telling a person there is nothing to answer.
