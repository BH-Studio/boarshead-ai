// ── TEAMS: NAMED SETS OF CONVERSATIONS, KEPT ON THEIR OWN FILE ─────────────
//
// A team is a set of conversations a person marked on the wall and named.
// Activating one narrows the tab strip to its members; leaving it widens the
// strip again. Neither ever ends work: the strip's own law (chattabs.go) is
// that the × closes a view, never work, and a team is only a view of the
// strip. A member whose tab was closed is still a member, and it carries the
// file and the workspace it needs to be opened again.
//
// A TEAM IS KNOWN BY ITS ID, NEVER BY ITS PLACE OR ITS NAME. The id is random
// and minted once; the active team, each team's remembered place on the wall,
// an open popover and every pointer target name a team by it, so deleting or
// reordering one never moves any of those onto another. The name is the
// person's and may change.
//
// THE STORE IS internal/teams. The file, the ids, the tree, the migration from
// the first build's spaces.json, handles, the manager and the lock two writers
// share all live there, because the team tools a model calls (internal/session)
// write the same file. What is here is the interface's side: which tabs make a
// team, how a team is named on the card, what the strip shows.
//
// EVERY EDIT HERE IS THE STORE'S READ-MODIFY-WRITE ([app.teamEdit], over
// [TeamsSeam.Update]). The change is made to what this window loaded, so the
// person sees it at once and keeps it even when the store refuses, and then
// made again, off the loop and under the store's lock, to the file as it is
// now, on whichever machine the session keeps it (teamseam.go); what that wrote
// is what the window holds afterwards. A manager, a handle or a member another
// process wrote since the opening is therefore kept, where saving the whole
// loaded list would have put the old list back over it.
//
// THE FRAME NEVER READS IT (framedisk_law_test.go). The file is read once, by
// [app.teamsEnsure], on an opening (the wall, an alt+digit, the strip chip);
// every function a frame calls reads only what that loaded.

// teamsFile is the file's name inside the profile directory, and
// teamsLegacyFile the first build's.
