// THE SEAT BLOCK: what a run's own tasks spent, rolled up by seat and drawn
// last on the spend page. Its reading is the plan store's rather than the
// machine-wide ledger's, so these tests hand the page a fake that answers
// PlanSpend the way the session does and stand it over a ledger that has
// something on it — the block is a second reading beside the ledger's, and it
// meets the page only where both are drawn.
