// tassort.go is WHAT THE LIST IS ORDERED BY, AND IT IS ALSO THE COLUMN THE LIST
// DRAWS. The two are one fact: THE SORT KEY IS THE COLUMN YOU SEE.
//
// The table has exactly two fact columns and both are always filled. `state` is
// the one word every row has. The second is the sort key — age by default, and
// cost or files only while the list is sorted by one of them — so a blank cell
// is now a TRUE ANSWER (this row cost nothing anybody recorded) rather than a
// missing one. Before it, the row's tail offered six facts and most rows could
// say two of them, so the right edge was holes, and a blank meant either
// "nothing to say" or "the frame ran out" with nothing on screen telling the two
// apart.
//
// SORTING IS INSIDE EACH LEVEL OF THE TREE AND THE TREE NEVER FLATTENS.
// Conversations order by their aggregate inside their section, the work under a
// conversation orders by its own value, and a family's children order among
// themselves. [tasksTreeOf] applies ONE comparison at each level it builds, so
// there is one answer to "which of these two rows comes first" wherever the
// question is asked.

// tasksSortKey is one of the five things this list can be ordered by.
