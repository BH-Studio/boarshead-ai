// THE JUMP CHIP: the one thing on this surface that says a scroll happened.

//
// A transcript that streams keeps the reader at the live edge on its own
// (view.go's [app.offsetFor]), and a reader who scrolls up to read something is
// dropped out of that arrangement until they scroll back down. That is the right
// bargain — a window that yanked itself to the bottom mid-sentence is a window
// nobody can read on — but it left the surface with a state it never mentioned:
// a reply can be arriving three screens below the last row on the frame, and the
// only sign of it was the status line saying something was working.
//
// So the surface says it, in the smallest way it can: one dim chip, at the LEFT
// edge — where the eye is, at the head of the row it is reading — floating on
// a row of whitespace that already existed. It was right-aligned until
// 2026-09-09, and out there, against the rail, it was the one thing on the
// frame nobody saw. It is chrome —
// dim — until the pointer is on it, and then it is accent, because at that
// moment it is the live thing on the frame. Clicking it rejoins the live edge
// and the chip is gone on the next frame, which is the whole of its behaviour.
//
// IT NEVER TAKES A ROW OF ITS OWN. The chip is drawn into the first row of the
// frame's breathing gap ([app.breathingRows]), so the transcript is exactly as
// tall with it as without it and nothing below it moves when it appears. On a
// window too short to have a gap the chip is not drawn at all — a surface that
// bought an affordance with a row of conversation would have spent the wrong
// thing — and the key below still works, because a key costs nothing.
//
// THE KEY IS ON THE CHIP because the mouse is opt-in on this surface (view.go's
// [app.View]): a person with ui.mouse off can see the chip and can never press
// it, and a control that cannot be operated by the only input the surface is
// guaranteed to have is a decoration. ctrl+l is the chord because every other
// way back to the bottom is unreachable while there is a sentence in the box —
// `end` and ctrl+e are end-of-line, ↓ moves the caret, pgdown is a page at a
// time — and because nothing on this keyboard was spelling it: in an alt-screen
// application the terminal's own ctrl+l (repaint the screen) means nothing at
// all, so the chord arrives here free and with its "latest" mnemonic intact.

// jumpKey is the chord that rejoins the live edge, written down once: the key
// router binds it and the chip prints it, and a chip that named a key nobody
// bound would be the surface lying about itself.

// rather than kept (view.go's [app.offsetFor] says why), so a second flag saying
// "the reader has scrolled" would be a second answer to a question that already
// has one — and the two would disagree the first time a turn streamed six rows
// into a window nobody had touched. Sticking is not enough on its own either: a
// conversation shorter than the window has nothing below it, and a chip offering
// to jump to a row that is already on screen is a chip that does nothing.
