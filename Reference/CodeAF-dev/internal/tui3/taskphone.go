// TASKS, REACHED BY A THUMB.
//
// The roster and the record were built for a keyboard and they show it at
// [tierPhone]: the strip is a row of chips three cells apart, the page under
// `alt+t` names its verbs in a dim sentence at the foot, and the card a row
// opens does the same. None of those is a thing a finger can do.
//
// Nothing new is invented here — the three doors already exist and every one of
// them is reachable with a key. What changes is their SHAPE on a phone:
//
//   - THE STRIP IS ONE DOOR, AND IT LOOKS LIKE ONE. A row of chips three cells
//     apart is a keyboard's idea of a tab bar: a thumb cannot land between two
//     of them, and the only door there — a press on the empty half — was
//     invisible. "Not accessible after some tabs" is a person who could not find
//     it. So at this tier the strip is a SINGLE full-width row that says what is
//     there and that it opens — `▸ 3 tasks · 1 running` — the fold glyph the
//     rest of the phone UI folds with ([glyphShut]), the count the chips would
//     have carried, and the most urgent state among them. The whole row is one
//     tap target, and it opens the roster PAGE ([app.showTaskPlace]) — the
//     scrollable list of task cards this file also shapes, not the overlay
//     column a keyboard drives.
//
//   - THE ROSTER PAGE IS A LIST OF CARDS WITH A WAY BACK. Its rows already open
//     on one press ([app.taskSheetPress]); at this tier each is a two-line CARD
//     a thumb goes into (the name and its state on top, what it did and how long
//     ago under it — the reading draws it, tasksplace.go), the list SCROLLS to
//     keep the cursor's card whole ([tasksTop] walks it in lines rather than in
//     rows), and its foot is a `‹ back` bar ([phoneBar]) instead of a key legend
//     — so a person leaves by tapping, no keyboard anywhere in the flow.
//
//   - THE CARD'S VERBS BECOME BANDS. `esc back · ↑↓ scroll · m puts it in your
//     message` is a sentence about keys; at this tier the two things it names
//     that a finger can do — going back, and putting the task in your message —
//     are the bar's targets instead, in home's own bar shape ([phoneBar]).
//
// So the whole flow is a thumb's: conversation → tap the `▸ tasks` door → the
// scrollable list of task cards → tap a card → the task record with its
// `‹ back` → back to the list → `‹ back` to the conversation. Two backs, both
// bands, mouse motion ignored on the glass the way home ignores it.

// taskPhoneMentionWord is the card's second target, and it is the same words the
// key line has always used for the same act — one gesture, one spelling.

//
// TWO TARGETS AND NOT THREE. The bar carries what a thumb can do and the card
// has exactly two of those — the scroll is the screen itself, and a target
// saying `↑↓ scroll` would be a target that does nothing when it is pressed.
// AND OVER ANOTHER WINDOW'S WORK IT CARRIES ONE. There is nothing landed for a
// mention to point at, so the chip is absent rather than drawn dead — the same
// answer the wide foot gives ([taskAwayCardKeys] says why), on the tier where a
// dead chip is worst: a thumb has no hover to discover with and finds out by
