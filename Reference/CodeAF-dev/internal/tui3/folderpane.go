// THE PREVIEW PANE, AND HOW THE SHEET'S WIDTH IS DIVIDED.
//
// The owner's reference is Yazi's arrangement (../reference-yazi.png): a
// readable path along the top, a NARROW ancestry column on the left, a GENEROUS
// list of what you are standing in, and a LARGE preview on the right — with the
// sizes right-aligned, one unmistakable selection, and compact controls at the
// foot. This file is the arithmetic of that, adapted to this surface's own
// tokens inside the framed context modal: quiet ancestry, readable names, a
// column-wide selection band, compact type cues and aligned previews. Gaps
// separate the columns without taking cells away from their names.
//
// THE PREVIEW TAKES THE THIRD COLUMN'S PLACE AND IT IS AN IMPROVEMENT ON IT
// rather than an addition. The browse used to draw the CHILDREN of the row
// under the cursor over there, which meant one readdir per cursor move on top
// of the two already in flight, and it could only ever show a folder. The
// preview pane shows the same folder's contents — the same readdir, done by
// contextpreview.go, cached and cancellable — AND a file's source with syntax
// colour, AND a picture, AND a PDF's text. So the region is stable: it is
// always "what is the thing under the cursor", whichever kind of thing that is.
//
// ── THREE STATES, TWO KEYS, AND THE RULE THAT MAKES SCROLLING OBVIOUS ───────
//
// The pane is BESIDE the list, ALONE on the sheet, or OFF. alt+w turns it off
// and back on; alt+o gives it the whole sheet and gives the sheet back.
//
// And the pane the arrow keys act on is THE PANE THAT IS DRAWN — there is no
// focus to lose track of. With a list on screen `↑↓` walk the list and
// `shift+↑↓` scroll the preview beside it; with the preview alone there is no
// list to walk, so `↑↓` scroll it and `←→` slide it sideways. A modal focus
// would have needed a fourth thing on the foot row to say where the keyboard
// currently was.
