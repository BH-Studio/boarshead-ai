// ── WHILE A TURN RUNS, THE CONVERSATION SHOWS THREE LINES OF WHAT IT IS DOING ─
//
// A completed turn out in the conversation is one chip: the question, the answer,
// and the machinery between them folded away (workfold.go). A RUNNING turn was
// the opposite — every thought, every call, every line of narration, drawn in
// full and scrolling under the reader's eye at the speed the model works. The
// person who asked the question is watching a machine's transcript of itself,
// and the answer they are waiting for is being pushed off the bottom of the
// frame by the work that is producing it.
//
// So the running turn draws what the finished one draws, one tense earlier: a
// compact rolling window of the last few STEPS, under the question, in the work
// column. A step is what caption.go already derives — "listing github issues",
// "reading 2 files in internal/tui3" — so nothing here invents a word about the
// work. There is no second vocabulary and no second derivation.
//
// WHAT THE WINDOW SAYS, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO SAY.
//
//   - THE STEP TITLES, AND NOTHING ELSE. No reasoning, no tool names, no
//     arguments, no output, no counts. Every one of those is a fact about the
//     machinery, and the machinery is what a person delegated precisely so they
//     would not have to watch it. All of it is one gesture away and none of it is
//     lost — the window HIDES rows, it never drops them.
//   - IT NEVER MANUFACTURES A STEP. Before the first caption, a Working state keeps
//     the window alive. Between finished calls, a quiet inline mark carries
//     activity beside the latest description without inventing another step.
//     The same row opens hidden work even before there is a caption to click.
//   - A NEW CAPTION ARRIVES ONLY WITH WORK. Silence can change the activity
//     state, but never invents another semantic description.
//   - IT NEVER SAYS THE TURN TWICE. A kept row splits a turn into runs, and a run
//     above the split can hold nothing but reasoning that is over — no step of
//     its own. Such a run draws NO door: a second `▸ Work · ctrl+e` on the same
//     key is one turn claiming to be two pieces of running work, which is the
//     reading [liveWork.last] already took the token column off every run but the
//     frontier to avoid. Its reasoning goes back under the ordinary
//     `thought for …` row (thinking.go, drawn by render.go's walk), which is the
//     chip a finished turn draws and carries its own door onto the working.
//
// THE MOTION IS THE ONE THIS SURFACE ALREADY OWNS. The newest step shimmers
// while a call under it is in flight, or only an inline mark moves between calls
// (captionmotion.go's [app.shimmer] — the spinner,
// relocated), and the steps above it step down the fade ladder the thinking
// window uses (styles.go's [thoughtFade]): faint, then dim, then the live one.
// Nothing here starts a timer or a goroutine; every frame this block moves on is
// a frame the running turn was already asking for (app.go's frame clock).
//
// ONE KEY, ONE CLICK, AND THE SAME KEY BACK. The block is the running turn's
// chip before the turn has finished, opened by the same gestures. Conversation
// windows use the turn key; rooms reserve zero beside positive phase keys.
// A click anywhere on it, or `ctrl+e`, opens the outline: every step as a caption
// row with its own door onto its own calls ([app.captionCallsOpen] keeps the
// running step's calls open and the past ones shut, exactly as it does under a
// finished chip). An opened window keeps a door of its own so the same key shuts
// it again.
//
// AND COMPLETION ALWAYS COLLAPSES IT, whatever the reader chose while it ran
// ([app.collapseLiveWork], called at the settle). The expansion is a thing a
// person wanted WHILE the work was happening; a turn that is over is an exchange
// again — a question and an answer — and the machinery behind it goes back
// behind the chip. This is the owner's ruling and it is the one place on this
// surface where a reader's expansion does not outlive what it was about.
//
// WHAT IT MAY NEVER COVER is [liveWorkKeeps], and the list is the conversation's
// own: the person's words, a question waiting to be answered, an explicit
// user-directed notice, a seam, an answer. A window that swallowed one of
// those would be hiding the one row on the frame that needed a person.
//
// THE LENS OPTS INTO LIVE COMPACTNESS separately from its past folds. A task
// room keeps its settled phase chips and compacts only the unowned live edge.
// A node's transcript inside a run's page stays detailed.

// liveStepRows is THE COMPACT READING BUDGET, and it is ROWS rather than steps.
//
// Three is the number the thinking window arrived at for the same reason
// (thinking.go): where the work is now, and the two steps it took to get there.
// Counting ROWS is what makes the budget survive a narrow frame — a caption that
// wraps to two lines has spent two of the three, and the alternative is a block
// that is three lines wide on this terminal and six on that one.
const liveStepRows = 3

// liveWorkWord is what the open block calls itself. It is [app.workfoldLabel]'s
// "worked" in the present tense, because it is the same chip about the same work
// one tense earlier, and a second vocabulary for a running turn would be a second
// thing to keep in step.
const liveWorkWord = "working"

// liveWork is one run of a running turn's machinery, and the steps inside it.
//
// It is derived per layout and journaled nowhere, exactly like [workfold]: the
// same entries derive the same window, and the reader's expansion dies with the
// turn that owned it.
//
// A turn holds more than one of these when the person has said something into
// it. A correction is one of their own messages and a window may not cover it,
// so the run ends there and a new one opens under it — which leaves their
// sentence standing between two compact blocks, where they said it.
