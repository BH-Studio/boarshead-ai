// ── THE MANAGER'S REAL CONVERSATION, HOSTED ON THE TEAMS PAGE ───────────────
//
// The ruling (c-2) is that the right pane of the teams page IS the selected
// team's manager conversation, the full chat: typing steers it, its prompts are
// answered in it, its Traffic rail is there. Not a render of it: the same
// conversation, with every key and every press it would have had.
//
// SO THE PAGE DOES NOT DRAW A CONVERSATION; IT LENDS ONE A RECTANGLE. While the
// pane hosts the manager ([app.teamsHosting]), the conversation's own geometry
// is the terminal less the rail on the left: [app.size] answers the narrower
// width, so every layout, scroll and hit test the conversation makes resolves
// against the cells it is really drawn in. The frame is the conversation's own
// ([app.chatFrameLines]) with two changes: the head's rows are the places'
// head at the full width (so the bar still says `teams`), and the page's header,
// members and inbox are pinned rows between the head and the transcript,
// charged in [app.topHeight] exactly as the task strip is, so the scrolling
// knows they are there. The rail is joined on the left of every row under the
// head.
//
// EVERY KEY AND POINTER EVENT THE PAGE DOES NOT TAKE IS HANDED TO THE
// CONVERSATION as if no place were standing ([app.teamsRoute]): the page is
// set aside for the length of that one message, the pointer's column is moved
// into the conversation's own cells, and the conversation answers exactly as
// it does on its own screen. The page keeps `tab`, the digits and the map (the
// place grammar), `alt+↑↓` (the page's buttons), and presses on its own rows.
//
// THE MANAGER IS BROUGHT IN FRONT when its team is selected
// ([app.teamsBringManager]), and that is the one move of the front this page
// makes: choosing a team is choosing whom to talk to. The conversation that was
// in front stays open behind.

// teamsHosting reports whether the pane hosts the manager now: the page is
// standing (or a message is being handed to the conversation), the selected
// team's manager is the conversation in front, and no surface that takes the
// whole frame is up over it. It is asked by [app.size] on every layout, so it
// reads a handful of fields and allocates nothing.
