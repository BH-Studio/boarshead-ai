// THE INDEX IS ONE FILE FOR THE WHOLE MACHINE, SO IT IS READ ONCE FOR THE WHOLE
// SCREEN.
//
// This is a PERFORMANCE law and it is stated as one because the cost of getting
// it wrong is invisible in every other test: the band drew the right rows the
// whole time it was re-parsing a megabyte of JSON on every arrival and every
// third second. What went wrong was the SHAPE of the cache — keyed by the row,
// over a reading that is global — which multiplied one file read by the number
// of rows a person walks past. Measured on a real machine with a 900KB index:
// 10ms of every keystroke, against 0.16ms for the whole rest of the frame.
//
// So: one reading on `open`, none at all while walking the list, and another
// only when the file has actually changed.
