// DRAG THE MOUSE OVER TEXT AND IT IS COPIED. That is the whole feature, and it
// exists because mouse reporting takes the terminal's own drag-select away: the
// app owns every mouse event while reporting is on, so the one gesture every
// terminal user owns — sweep the pointer over text, paste it somewhere — did
// nothing at all here unless they knew about ctrl+s or copy mode. Both of those
// remain (copymode.go), but a person should not need to know a chord to copy a
// sentence they can see.
//
// So the drag is answered in kind: press, sweep, and the cells under the sweep
// wear the selection highlight; release, and their text is on the clipboard —
// stripped of paint and rails exactly as copy mode strips it, written over
// OSC 52 so it works over ssh and through tmux, with a word on the status line
// saying what landed.
//
// ── CELLS, NOT ROWS ──
//
// The first build selected whole rows, on the reasoning that a transcript is
// made of lines and a row has no seams around wide glyphs. Both true, and
// neither is what a person's hand is asking for: a press on the third word and
// a release on the fifth means those three words, on every screen they have
// ever used, and a sweep that answered with the whole line read as broken
// rather than as opinionated (#222). So the selection is a STREAM, the way a
// terminal's is — from the anchor cell to the end of its row, every row between
// in full, and the head's row up to the pointer — and a sweep that stays on one
// row is the span between its two columns. The wide-glyph seam is answered by
// snapping: a column is converted through the row's plain text so a glyph is
// wholly in or wholly out, and a selection never emits half of one.
//
// The gestures a hand already knows come with it: a double-click takes the word
// under the pointer, a triple-click the row, and a plain click is still a click.
// The whole-row copy the old sweep did is what triple-click does now.
//
// ── THE GESTURE IS ANCHORED TO CONTENT, NOT TO THE GLASS ──
//
// Every row coordinate this file keeps is an index into the body's OWN row
// list, converted from the screen the moment the event arrives. The first build
// kept screen rows, and a streaming room broke both gestures at once: a task's
// page follows its live edge and repaints four times a second, so between a
// press and its release the text slid up under the pointer — the parked click
// fired on whatever had scrolled into the cell (usually nothing), and a sweep
// copied rows the person never highlighted. Anchored to content, the selection
// rides the scroll, the click opens the row that was actually pressed, and a
// row that has scrolled clean off the screen resolves to no click at all.
// Columns need no such conversion: the body is drawn from column zero and only
// ever scrolls vertically.
//
// ── WHAT THIS COSTS THE CLICK, AND WHY IT IS SAFE TO PAY ──
//
// A drag and a click begin identically: a left press. The press therefore
// cannot act on the body any more — a drag that begins on a thinking block
// would collapse the very text somebody is trying to copy, and the collapse
// would shuffle every row under the selection mid-sweep. So a press on the BODY
// is parked, and the body acts on RELEASE: release in place is the click,
// exactly as every button in every GUI has fired on mouse-up for forty years,
// and release after a sweep is a copy and no click at all. The chrome — offer
// rows, panels, chips, the rail, the strip — keeps firing on press, because
// nothing anybody drags starts on a button.
type dragSelect struct {
	// parked is a left press the body has not answered yet: the click fires on

// selects". That reasoning was about what a SWEEP means and got applied to what

// and drifted across it was silently spent as a two-line copy — the tool call
