// A landing is `[a] accept · [n] not right` on its card, in its room and on its

// keys are task-states' own, letter for letter). HOME CANNOT OFFER A LETTER. Its
// box says "type to search or start something new" and the promise has no
// asterisk — a bare letter on this screen always types, whatever the cursor is
// resting on (home.go's [app.homeKey] states it), and the ONE printable
// exception it allows is a digit drawn on the row itself. An `a` that sometimes
// accepted a landing and sometimes began "a site for my café" is the mode that
// law exists to forbid.
//
// So the KEY is home's and the WORDS are the task's: `1 accept   2 not right`,
// read off [session.TaskAsk], mapped back to the landing's own keys before the
// answer leaves this surface ([needsLandingKey]). Nothing about the answer is
