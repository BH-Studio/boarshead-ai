// THE AGENT-BUILDING SEAM (tui3.go's [Conversation]).
//
// The door hands this surface two closures that build a conversation and
// everything that answers for it in the same call. These are the surface's half:
// that /new and a resume go through them when they are wired, that they are
// asked about THIS conversation's own workspace, and — the reason the seam
// exists at all — that the closures which came with a conversation are the ones
// a keystroke in that conversation reaches.

// seamHistory is a recall list that records nothing. These tests care only about
// WHICH conversation's list the surface is holding, never about its contents.

// TestAnAlwaysAfterNewReachesTheConversationInFront is this lane's proof.
//
// THE BUG IT REPRODUCES. The consent card's "always" does two things: it writes
// the rule into the person's profile, and it hands the gate the running session
// is behind a rebuilt policy (cmd/codeaf's chatv3_approval.go). The second half
// was wired once, at boot, around the agent the door opened before this surface
// existed — so after a /new the write still landed and the push went into the
// session that /new had just closed. The card said `saved`, it was saved, and
// the very next call asked again, with nothing on screen to connect the two.
//
// It cannot be written against the code this lane replaces, and that is the
// shape of the fault rather than a gap in the test: before [Options.Start] there
// was exactly ONE save seam on the whole surface and no way for a second
// conversation to carry its own, so there was nothing for an assertion to
// compare. What is asserted here is that the boot conversation's seam is never
// reached again once a new conversation is in front.
