// THE STANDING RUN LANE, which is what makes an adaptive run visible at all.
//
// A run is not a node: no row, no roster, nothing on screen that knows it
// exists. Its three event kinds are the whole of the surface's knowledge of one,
// and they arrive on a subscription of the session's own — never on a turn's
// stream, because the run outlives the turn that started it. Until this lane was
// opened the events fired into nothing and the run's page could not be reached.

// runLaneAgent is a session driving adaptive runs: the standing lane, and
// nothing else. It deliberately does NOT implement the run's doors, because the
// lane is the half under test and a surface with the lane alone must still fold
// what arrives on it.
