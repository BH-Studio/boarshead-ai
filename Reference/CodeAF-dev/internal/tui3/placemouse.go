// ── THE POINTER ON A PLACE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Three gestures, one law each, and every one of them is the same law on all
// seven places:
//
//	a press on a tab word   goes to that place (topnav.go's [app.navPress])
//	a press on a body row   is `enter` on it: the cursor lands and the row
//	                        opens, and a click never spends (pages.go's
//	                        [place.press])
//	the pointer resting     previews the row it is over, and moves nothing —
//	                        over a tab word, that preview is the word's
//	                        hover ground (topnav.go's [app.navHover])
//	the wheel               walks the cursor, three rows a tick, and over the
//	                        nav walks the places, one room a tick
//
// THIS FILE IS THE ARITHMETIC AND NEVER THE PLACES. Which place answers which
// gesture is pages.go's — it is the one file that may know them all by name —
// and what is here is what does not vary between them: turning a row of the
// terminal into a line of a body, keeping a window over that body under the
// cursor, and repainting only when the pointer actually moved.
//
// WHY THE SPANS AND THE WINDOWS ARE WRITTEN BY THE DRAW. A press resolves
// against what was PAINTED, never against a second computation of what should
// have been painted: the tab bar gives up words as the frame narrows, and a
// body scrolls, so a span or a line computed independently would open the wrong
// room or act on the wrong row exactly when a person could not tell why.

// placeWheelRows is how far one turn of the wheel walks a place's cursor. It is
// three because three is what every other list on this surface moves by
// (app.go's wheel ladder, copy mode, the task page, home), and a wheel that
// meant a different distance on the places would be one gesture with seven
// speeds.
const placeWheelRows = 3

// placeWheelDelta is one turn of the wheel as a distance, and zero for a button
// that is not the wheel at all.

// placeTabWheel is the wheel turned over the nav's row on a place: IT WALKS
// THE PLACES.
//
// The wheel means "the next one of these" everywhere else on this surface — it
// walks a list's cursor, three rows a tick (placeWheelRows) — and over a row
// whose contents are the seven rooms, the next one of these is the next room. It
// is `tab` and `shift+tab` under the hand that is already on the bar, which is
// the same bargain the chips already struck with the left button.
//
// ONE ROOM PER TICK AND NOT THREE. A wheel notch that walked three places would
// open two rooms nobody asked to see on its way to the third, and each of those
// openings closes the last room and throws away its filter.

// placeBodyLine turns a row of the terminal into a line of a place's body,
// given the window the last draw put over it.
//
// THE HEAD IS ONE NUMBER FOR EVERY PLACE ([placeHeadRows]) and the window is
// two more: which line was drawn first, and how many were drawn. A row past the
// last drawn one belongs to the foot — the rule, the note, the composer, the
// strip, the hint — and answers nothing, which is what stops a press on the
// hint line acting on a body row that scrolled off the top.

// placeTop is the window a place's body is drawn through: the first line of it
// that fits on screen with the cursor still on screen.
//
// THE WINDOW FOLLOWS THE CURSOR AND IS NEVER SCROLLED ON ITS OWN. It is the
// bargain the task page, home and the standing place all already struck, and it
// is what makes the wheel and `↓` one gesture rather than two — a place with an
// offset of its own would need a second key to bring the cursor back into view.
// A body that fits whole has no window at all, which is the common case and
// costs nothing.

// placeHoverMoved selects the pointed row and records its pointer styling,
// repainting only when either changes.

// one of them would be a screen redrawn eighty times for a highlight that did

// walkPage is `tab` and `shift+tab`: the next place, and round again from the

//
// IT USED TO ASK WHETHER THE NEXT ROOM WOULD LET IT IN. Tasks refused on a
// machine that had run no work and standing refused with no orders on it, so
// `tab` walked into the refusal, was put straight back where it started, and did
// it again on the next press — on a fresh machine the circle had one member and
// the key read as broken, which is what the owner met ("left right does not seem
// to move tabs, only shift does", shift+tab happening to land on settings, which
// always opened). The walk answered it by asking a `pageReady` before turning any
// handle.
//
// EVERY ROOM OPENS NOW (pages.go's [app.showPage]), so there is nothing to ask:
// the next place is the next place, and a room with nothing in it spends the

// segment in the status line already follows and the reason there is no
// settings page anywhere in this gesture: pressing the model is `/model`,

// press exactly as the conversation's own cells do (`alt+e`, `alt+a`) — so
// the pointer and the keyboard reach the same four doors by the same names,
// on every place with a draft (boxseam.go).
//
// THE COLUMNS ARE THE ONES THE FRAME DREW (homedraft.go's [app.targetLegend]

// ── the pointer, in the box ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

// placeBoxPress answers a click on the composer a place draws at its foot, and

// box already answers (draftclick.go) reaching the other seven screens: a press
// puts the caret on the letter it landed on, at the row's end past the end of a
// line, and at the start of the text left of it.
//
// IT IS THE ROUTER'S ROW, WHICH IS WHY IT LIVES HERE AND IS READ WHERE IT IS.
// The box is drawn by [placeFrameWithBar] on every place, in the same cells, so
// a press answered by whichever place happens to be standing would be the same
// row meaning different things in different rooms — the argument the tab bar's
// own press is read first for.
//
// THE ARITHMETIC IS THE FRAME'S OWN AND NEVER A SECOND COPY OF IT.
// [draftClickIndex] is the pure inverse of the layout [draftBlock] drew the
// rows with, and it is handed exactly the numbers the frame handed the drawing:
// the same room, the same row cap, the same head. A press and a paint that
// each did their own wrap would disagree on any line that wrapped.
