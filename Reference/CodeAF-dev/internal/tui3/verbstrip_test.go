// ── THE STRIP BELONGS TO A ROW ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// verbstrip.go states the law — "a letter cannot act on a row that has moved out
// from under it" — and for three waves it was enforced by a list of the keys
// that move a cursor. The tasks place binds four more spellings of its own
// cursor (`ctrl+n`, `ctrl+p`, `home`, `end`), none of which were on that list,
// so `→` over a running task and then `ctrl+n` left the strip standing under a
// DIFFERENT row, and `s` there stopped the task the strip was captured on.
//
// These tests are about the law and not about the list: the strip is bound to
// the row's own name, so a key nobody has bound yet cannot get past it.

// stripWalkLab is the tasks place with three rows that can be stopped and the
// cursor on the MIDDLE one, so that every key either end of the list moves it.
