// ── THE NEW-CHAT START PAGE: `+`, AND THE CONVERSATION THAT IS NOT MADE YET ──
//
// The tab strip grew a `+` and the question that comes with one is what it is
// allowed to DO. A browser's plus opens an empty tab and costs nothing; this
// surface's cheapest equivalent — /new — is a synchronous conversation swap that
// asks the door for an agent, puts the one on screen into the keeper, and over a
// shared engine handle ENDS it, because the far side holds one conversation at a
// time (keeper.go's [app.stow] says so in those words). A `+` wired to that would
// be a control that closes somebody's work by being pressed, and pressing it
// twice by accident would close two.
//
// So `+` OPENS A PAGE AND NOTHING ELSE. No agent, no session file, no wire, no
// keeper entry, nothing on the recency stack. What it opens is the greeting's own
// unit — the wordmark, the model line, a real message box, this directory's last
// conversations — standing over the conversation the person was in, which is
// still exactly where they left it one `esc` away. The conversation is made by
// the FIRST MESSAGE, through the same door /new and home already use, and not a
// keystroke earlier.
//
// ── THE THREE THINGS THAT MUST NOT LEAK ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// 1. THE OLD SENTENCE STAYS IN THE OLD CHAT. The page is a blank box, and the
//    half-written message behind it — its caret, its tray, the documents behind
//    its compact tokens — belongs to the conversation it was typed at and comes
//    back untouched on `esc`. This is not written here: the box is a view onto
//    one recipient's composer and the start page is a recipient of its own
//    (recipient.go's [startRecipient]), so the swap in and the swap out are the
//    same two calls every task page already makes.
//
// 2. NOTHING THE OLD CHAT WAS HOLDING RIDES OUT ON THE FIRST MESSAGE. /new's own
//    law is that the draft goes with the PERSON — it copies the leaving box, its
//    chips and its pastes forward into the new conversation (app.go's
//    [app.renew]) — and that law is right for /new and wrong here, because `+`
//    promises the conversation you were in keeps its draft. So the create is
//    asked for and then the start page's OWN composer is laid out over what the
//    renew carried, which is the one line of policy this file adds.
//
// 3. A DOOR THAT REFUSES LOSES NOTHING. The refusal is said on the page rather
//    than noted into a transcript that is not on the frame, the words stay in
//    the box, and the conversation behind is untouched — [app.renew] asks the
//    door before it puts anything down, so a failure costs exactly nothing.
//
// ── WHAT IT IS NOT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It is not home. Home is a dashboard over the whole machine and takes the frame
// whole — no tab strip, no room header — and raising it takes six disk readings
// and spends the greeting for good (home.go's [app.raiseHome] calls
// [app.dismissWelcome]). It is not a new AGENT either: nothing is instantiated,
// and a person who opens the page three times and escapes three times has made
// nothing and closed nothing.

// An unnamed conversation cannot be kept by the existing session keeper. Refuse
// creation before detaching it when doing so would strand its unsent words.
const startDraftUnownedWord = "finish or clear the draft in the current chat before starting another"

// startKeepsLeaving keeps the draft behind either new-conversation surface.
//
// A FRESH CONVERSATION HOLDING AN UNSENT SENTENCE IS KEPT. /new's exception ends
// a fresh and empty conversation because nothing is in it and the draft goes with
// the PERSON — same box, same person, one step later. `+` promises the opposite
// in as many words: the conversation you were in keeps its draft. Replacing it
// ends the only owner that sentence has, and then the create is holding somebody's
// paragraph with nowhere to put it but the new conversation's box — a draft in
// front of a model it was never addressed to, which is the one leak this page
// exists to prevent. Kept, the words stay in their own conversation and come back
// by pressing its tab.
//
// HOME MAKES THE SAME PROMISE. Its new conversation starts with its own box and
// tray, while the conversation behind it keeps the draft somebody left there.
// /new inside a conversation still carries the draft forward.
