// ── ONE GRAMMAR, EVERY PLACE ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This is the whole key law of the places, in one function, and the reason it is
// one function is the finding tui2 already wrote down about the surface before
// this one: "self was a page with a page-local key grammar, a place enum, its own
// focus zone and its own esc ladder; services were a second page beside it; the
// notebook was an overlay. Four surfaces, four sets of keys, four ways to be
// lost." An enum is fine. A per-place key grammar is not.
//
// SIX CLASSES, AND A KEY BELONGS TO EXACTLY ONE (SCREEN 3a):
//
//	↑↓ enter esc tab      move, open, back out, next place      never text
//	any printable         goes to the composer, always          never a verb
//	alt+enter             send what you typed off as a task     one chord
//	alt+1…8               jump straight to a place              drawn on the map
//	alt+<letter>          change how THIS place is shown        drawn on the map
//	shift+←→↑↓            move this place's time window         no letters spent
//	→ then a letter       act on the row — letters are verbs only here
//
// AND THE TAB BAR IS ONE OF THE ROWS `↑↓` MOVE THROUGH. It is drawn over every
// place's body, so the row above the first row of a body is the same row on all
// seven: `↑` off the top lands on it, `←`/`→` walk the seven words without
// opening anything, `enter` or `↓` goes into the one under the cursor, and `esc`
// comes back down. Two arrows change meaning up there and the change is stated
// where a person can see it — `←`/`→` are ROW verbs (the strip, the folds) and
// the bar is not a row of any place's reading — so nothing on the bar acts on a
// row that is not under the cursor (pages.go's [barCursor]).
//
// Two adaptations to terminal reality, both forced and both stated:
//
//   - THE MAP IS A CHORD, NOT A HOLD. A terminal cannot tell a program that a
//     modifier is down; it only says what arrived. So SCREEN 3b's "hold alt and
//     the map appears" is `alt+.`, which draws the map in the cells a person was
//     already reading and leaves it there until the next key.
//   - `alt+b` AND `alt+f` ARE NOT AVAILABLE to the alt+letter class. They are
//     the word jumps inside every box on this surface, the manual says they
//     "work nearly everywhere", and a composer that lost them would be a
//     composer that got worse to type in so that a place could gain a view.
//
// AND A BOX THAT HAS TAKEN THE KEYBOARD OWNS ITS OWN KEYS. The router claims
// keys at the PLACE level; a layer inside a place that has deliberately taken
// the whole keyboard — home's errand pane, the settings panel's value editor and
// its model picker — is read before this function and keeps every key it had.
// That is not an exception to one grammar, it is the same arbitration the manual
// already states about `tab`: everything else that wants it gets it first, and
// the router is the last claimant rather than the first.
//
// WHERE IT IS CALLED FROM MATTERS. A case added to input.go's plain switch is
// invisible to every place, because each place's handler returns above it. So
// the router is read twice, by design: once inside [app.placeKeyPress] —
// reached from one place only, the conversation router's pageShowing branch
// (input.go) — and once more as the first line of the handlers that kept the
// old convention (tasks, home), which costs nothing: it is idempotent for a
// key it did not take. That is also what leaves the task page's
// "every printable key is the filter" law untouched: `alt+` and `shift+`
// chords carry no text and never reach a default arm.

// placeKeyPress is every key on whatever place is standing: the router's own six
// classes first, and then that place's own reading of whatever is left.
//
// IT IS THE ONE DOOR, and that is what makes the grammar one grammar. Each place
// used to open its own handler with a call to [app.placeKey], which worked and
// was five copies of the same two lines — a place added later that forgot them
// would be a room `tab` could not leave.
