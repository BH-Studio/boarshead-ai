// ── A PAGE READING SOMEBODY ELSE'S WORK SAYS WHEN THAT WORK IS WAITING ─────
//
// The owner's task lane cannot answer this: a node stopped on a question is
// still `running`, so a reading page drew a clock over work that had not moved
// since somebody was asked something. The questions lane can — it replays
// everything open the moment the view attaches — and the whole of what this page
// does with it is DRAW it. Answering belongs to the window that owns the work,
// and the wire refuses this connection the answering door by construction
// (internal/remote's watcherReads).
