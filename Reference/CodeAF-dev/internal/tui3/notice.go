// THE NOTICES: telling a person one thing at the moment it becomes true.
//
// A surface learns you by what you have already done, and this file is where it
// keeps what it has told you. Two kinds of thing live here at launch:
//
//   - EARNED HINTS. One dim line beside the box — `/files finds files codeaf
//     wrote for you` — on the row directly above the rule over home's box, and
//     over the project at the right of a conversation's keys row. A tip RETIRES FOR GOOD
//     the first time the gesture it teaches is used (the files place opened),
//     or after it has been shown [noticeShownDefault] times without being
//     acted on. A hint that stays
//     up after you have learned the key is a cheatsheet, and a cheatsheet is
//     read once and never again (render.go's [app.hintWord] says the same about
//     static keys).
//   - NEWS. One dim transcript line, said once, the first time this binary runs
//     after its build changed — the place a shipped feature announces itself.
//     The channel exists and is empty; a wave that ships something registers a
//     row with [notice.news] set and writes nothing else.
//
// ONE TABLE, TWO BOXES, TWO RULES. Until 2026-09-22 a hint row named which box
// it could draw beside; the owner ruled that there is ONE set of tips, and the
// two boxes say them by rules of their own, because a conversation is a screen
// you sit in and home is a screen you pass through. A CONVERSATION RANKS: the
// first eligible row in the table's order takes the foot, so a tip that has
// just become true is said at once — `/compact summarizes the conversation
// now` when the window crosses half, not forty minutes later — and
// [noticeGap] keeps a busy first session from reading as a slideshow
// ([noticeBoard.rank]). HOME TAKES TURNS: every tip that is true gets one, the
// row moving on with every visit and every [hintEvery] at rest
// ([noticeBoard.rotate]). Both go through [noticeBoard.pick].
//
// THE TABLE BELOW IS THE ONE PLACE A NOTICE IS WRITTEN DOWN, the way commands.go
// is the one place a command is. [checkNotices] runs over it at init and fails
// the build on a duplicate id, an empty line, a retire event nobody defined, or
// a word from the machinery vocabulary this surface does not use in front of a
// person.
//
// EVENTS, NOT POLLING. The surface never asks every frame whether a hint has
// become relevant; it is TOLD, at the small set of seams that prove a gesture
// happened ([app.noticeEvent]) — a task started, the task page opened, a turn
// ended. An event retires every notice that names it, records that it happened
// (which is what arms the hints that wait on it), and re-decides what each slot
// holds. The deciding is [noticeBoard.pick], and it is pure: it reads the board
// and the candidates and touches nothing else, so the arbitration has tests that
// need no frame.
//
// WHAT IS REMEMBERED IS PER PROFILE, in one small file beside config.json
// (notice_ledger.go): how many times each notice has been shown, when it
// retired, and which build the news channel last saw. A missing or unreadable
// ledger is an empty one — a person is never told their hints file is corrupt,
// because the worst case is a tip they have seen before.

// noticeSlot is where a notice may draw. The type is an enum rather than a bool
// so a later wave can add one without touching the rows that exist — a new
// slot lands as one constant above [noticeSlots] and one case in
// [app.noticeShow].

// before the project, and on a row of its own above the rule. That last one
// had to be told where the rule's numbers and the task column's divider were;
// the keys row's right end is where the project already stands, wherever the
// column is.
//
// IT WAITS FOR FIFTEEN SECONDS OF QUIET, on conversations alone. A
// conversation is a screen somebody works in, and a sentence appearing under
// the answer they are reading, or between two things they are typing, is the
// surface talking over them. Every key, press, wheel and paste starts the
// wait again ([app.stirred]), and so does a turn ending, because the answer
// arriving is exactly when somebody starts reading. Home's row does not wait:
