// THE LANDED `your call` IS A QUESTION, AND IT FOLLOWS THE PERSON EVERYWHERE.
//
// A node that lands needing a look invites the person into its room — the
// roster says `your call`, enter opens the page — and for a while the page they
// arrived on had nothing to answer with: `this task has finished — say it to
// main` at the foot, over work nobody had decided about (#767). The answers are
// the landing question's now, on the block above the box, drawn on whichever
// page a person is standing on; what is left to this file is that the room stops
// claiming the work is finished, and that the frame's hint slot names the same
// letters the block draws (tasksettle.go).

// roomQuestionFake is a room fake that also holds the questions lane, so the
// block has its optional half ([questionAgent] states the law).
