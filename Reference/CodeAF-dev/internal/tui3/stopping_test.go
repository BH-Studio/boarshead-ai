// THE STOP, AND THE SECONDS AFTER IT.

// [app.interrupt] has always been instant in the session — the turn's context is
// cancelled on the keystroke — and the question these tests are about is whether
// the SCREEN was. It was not: the engine keeps the stream open until its turn
// loop lets go, which for a `bash` holding a leaked pipe or a `jobs` kill is
// three or four seconds, and for the whole of that window the surface went on
// drawing what arrived. What is pinned here is the law that closed it: the frame
// after esc shows no motion, claims "working" nowhere, and draws nothing new
// until the turn is over ([app.windingDown], [keptAfterStop], [stoppingWord]).

// stoppingApp is a turn caught mid-flight, with the two things on screen that a
// stop is most likely to interrupt: a tool that is running and a reply that is
// still arriving.

// stoppingAppOnAHeldClock is the same turn WITH THE CLOCK IN THE TEST'S HAND,
// the way stopbound_test.go's [boundedStopApp] holds its own.
//
// THE HEAD DRAWS THE TIME OF DAY ON EVERY FRAME (pulse.go's [pulseClock], off
// [app.now]), so a test that compares two whole frames is comparing the wall
// clock too whether it meant to or not. Left on [time.Now] that comparison
// fails whenever its two captures straddle a minute boundary, which is about
// three quarters of one percent of runs at these durations: measured at one
// failure in eighty one, and read on a pull request as a regression in a change
// that could not reach the path (#1370).
//
// THE CLOCK IS PINNED RATHER THAN THE HEAD BEING EXCLUDED FROM THE COMPARISON,
// because the comparison catching ANY drawing after a stop is the whole of what
// these tests are for, and an exclusion would buy the same green by making the
// assertion weaker. [TestTheStoppedFramesComparisonStillCoversTheHead] is what
// holds that line.
//
// It is pinned HERE and not in [newTestApp], which has calling files in the
