// ── THE CARD'S RHYTHM, AND ITS THREE ROLES ──────────────────────────────────
//
// The right column of home is a stack of bands (homebands.go), and every one of
// them used to be separated from its neighbour by exactly one blank row. That is
// a rhythm with no information in it: the address under the title, the bill
// under the work and the verbs under the bill all stood the same distance apart,
// so a card of seven bands read as seven facts in a heap rather than as four
// readings of one conversation. The owner met it as "the right side preview —
// make the spacing a bit more wide… it seems small".
//
// SO THE CARD HAS GROUPS, AND THE GAP IS WHAT SAYS SO. Four readings, in the
// order somebody asks them:
//
//	identity    what this is called, and where it lives
//	activity    what it is stopped on, what it ran, what it made
//	economics   what it cost
//	verbs       what can be done with it
//
// ONE GAP LAW, APPLIED EVERYWHERE ON THE CARD. Bands inside a group stand
// [homeCardGap] apart; groups stand [homeCardGroupGap] apart. There is no third
// gap, and in particular there is no tighter one: two lines that want to be
// closer than a blank row are ONE BAND rather than two — which is exactly what
// the title and the address are, because the address is the title's second line
// and was never a fact in its own right.
//
// AND AIR IS THE FIRST THING GIVEN UP. A frame too short for the card at the
// group rhythm is drawn at the flat one before a single band is dropped, and
// only a frame too short for THAT loses bands from the bottom
// ([homeCardStack]). Whitespace is the cheapest thing on this card and a fact is
// the dearest, so they go in that order.

// homeCardGap is the blank rows between two bands of one group, and
// homeCardGroupGap the blank rows between two groups. They are the card's whole
// spacing vocabulary and they are written down once: a number spelled at each
// band is a number that drifts the day somebody adds a band.
const (
	homeCardGap      = 1
	homeCardGroupGap = 2
)

// homeCardPlaceRow is which row of a card the place line is: the SECOND, and
// never further down.
//
// The address is the title's own second line — identity is one band and not two
// — and a short frame drops bands from the bottom without ever touching the
// first, so neither the rhythm nor the room a card is given can move it. The
// rule is written down once here rather than as a `2` spelled at each of the
// tests that assert it, because a number spelled three times is a number that
// drifts.
const homeCardPlaceRow = 1

// cardGroup is which of the card's four readings a band belongs to. The order
// of the constants is the order they are read in, top to bottom.

	return out
}

// homeCardStack assembles a card out of grouped bands, in the room it was given.
//
// IT GIVES UP AIR BEFORE IT GIVES UP A FACT, and it never truncates a band. The
// three steps are the whole law: the group rhythm if it fits, the flat rhythm if
// it does not, and then whole bands off the bottom until it does. The first band
// is not up for negotiation — a card that dropped its own title would be a
// preview that cannot say what it is previewing.
