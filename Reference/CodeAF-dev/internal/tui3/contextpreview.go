// WHAT A FILE IS, READ OFF THE LOOP AND BOUNDED IN EVERY DIRECTION.
//
// The context browser shows a person what they are about to attach BEFORE they
// attach it, which means it opens strangers' files on a keystroke: a directory
// walked with the arrow keys hands this code a minified bundle, a four gigabyte
// core dump, a photograph, a scanned invoice and a symlink into a mount that has
// gone away, in whatever order the person happens to move.
//
// So this file is the reading half and it holds four laws.
//
// NOTHING IS EXECUTED AND NOTHING IS FETCHED. A preview opens a file for
// reading and stats a directory. It does not run a script because it is
// executable, does not follow a URL because a file mentions one, and does not
// shell out to a converter. Looking at a thing must never be the same gesture as
// running it — that is the whole difference between a browser and a launcher.
//
// SOMEBODY ELSE'S BYTES REACH NO FRAME UNPARSED. Every line kept here has been
// through [drawableLine]: escape sequences stripped, control bytes dropped, tabs
// expanded. A preview pane is a rectangle inside a framebuffer this surface
// composes, and a file carrying `\x1b[2J` would otherwise clear the person's
// screen when the cursor moved onto it.
//
// EVERY BOUND IS STATED AS A CONSTANT AND NONE IS A HOPE. Bytes read, lines
// held, cells in a line, pixels decoded, entries listed, previews cached and
// readers running at once all have a number below, because the file on the other
// side of the cursor is chosen by somebody else.
//
// AND AN ANSWER ABOUT A MOMENT THAT HAS PASSED IS DROPPED. A read is stamped
// with the generation that asked for it and with the file's own size and
// modification time; [previewPump.took] refuses an answer that does not match
// both. Walking down a directory faster than a disk can answer is the ordinary
// case, not the exotic one.
//
// The drawing half is contextpreviewdraw.go, and the split is deliberate: what
// this file produces is DATA — no palette, no width, no escape sequences — so a
// preview can be read once and drawn at any size, and the renderer can be tested
// without a disk.
