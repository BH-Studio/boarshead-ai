// THE LAW: A HARNESS PAYS NO DEADLINE FOR A WAITER ITS OWNER KNOWS CANNOT
// ANSWER. An owner may register an exact channel, say that no goroutine writes
// it, and report that its queue is open and empty. Only then does the harness
// drop the waiter immediately. A queued value and a close still travel through
// the command, and every unregistered owner or family stays on the old road.
// Waiters on that road still overlap: three parked waiters cost one budget
// between them instead of three, because the harness starts all three and then
// waits once.
//
// WHY THIS IS THE FIX AND NOT A SHORTER BUDGET. The note above [cmdBudget] is
// right and is not reopened: #463 measured that these waiters do answer, usually
// out of buffered channels, and a budget tuned to their observed microseconds
// turns a delivered event into a drop when the scheduler is busy. The seam
// removes that timing guess by asking the synchronous fake about work already
// queued. No knob shortens [cmdBudget], and an owner that cannot state the fact
// gets every microsecond of it.
//
// WHAT IS ALLOWED TO OVERLAP IS EXACTLY [blockingCommands], MINUS TWO. Running
// two commands beside each other is only safe when neither touches anything the
// other can see, and this package's waiters are written to one shape: receive
// from a channel, wrap what came off it in a message, return. They read no field
// of [app] and call nothing that does — [waitEvent]'s fold loop is the longest
// of them and it touches only locals, [foldsInto] and [isLump]. So they may run
// together, and everything else on the belt still runs one at a time exactly
// where it did, because a command that reads a fake or writes the surface would
// be a data race the moment it had company.
//
// The two exceptions are [app.watchDriving] and [app.watchFollowing], whose
// commands CALL A FUNCTION THE TEST SUPPLIED (`<-changed()`, `<-follow()`)
// rather than receiving from a channel they were handed. What that function
// does is the test's business, so it is not this file's to run concurrently.
// They keep the old serial path and pay the old price.

// harnessQueueState is a synchronous fake owner's reading of its own channel.

// AND THE TICK DOES NOT START A WALL TIMER, WHICH IS WHERE MOST OF THE TIME WAS.
//
// The measurement of 2026-09-08, over the whole package at 564s: 447s of it was
// spent on commands the harness dropped, and bubbletea's tick was 197s of that
// — one line, more than every waiter put together. Another 84s went on ticks
// that did answer, and the answer is usually [frameMsg], which [drive] throws
// away. A tick is a timer that was started when the command was BUILT
// (bubbletea's Tick calls time.NewTimer before it returns the closure), so its
// wait is running whether the harness is standing over it or not; standing over
// it is pure loss.
//
// A tick can use the harness clock because this package's tick callbacks do
// nothing: every one
// of them is `func(time.Time) tea.Msg { return someMsg{…} }` over values captured
// when the command was built. [TestEveryTickCallbackIsAMessageAndNothingElse]
// reads the package's own source and holds that. [harnessTick] delivers callbacks
// through the harness immediately when their delay was inside [tickBudget], and
// does not call callbacks for polls the old harness could not receive.
//
// THE ONE EXCEPTION IS taskmention.go's, which calls the reader the surface was
// handed (`read()`). It is inside the budget and therefore runs synchronously
// on the harness's own path, never beside the test.

// overlappable reports whether a command may be left running while the harness
