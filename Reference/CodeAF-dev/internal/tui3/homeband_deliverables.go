// ── THE FILES A CONVERSATION LEFT BEHIND ────────────────────────────────────
//
// ONE READING OF THE INDEX SERVES EVERY CARD ON THE SCREEN, and that is the
// whole architecture of this file. The deliverables index is ONE file for the
// whole machine — every file every conversation ever made, appended — and a card
// wants the handful of rows carrying its own session id. This band used to read
// and parse the WHOLE index inside its own draw, cached per conversation and
// expiring on home's beat, which made two costs nobody could see:
//
//   - EVERY ARRIVAL ON A ROW paid for the whole file, because the cursor moving
//     to a row is a cache key nobody has read yet. Measured on a real machine
//     with a 900KB index: 10ms per keystroke and per hovered row, against 0.16ms
//     for the whole rest of the frame — sixty times the cost of everything else
//     on the screen put together, spent walking rows that belong to other
//     conversations.
//   - AND SO DID EVERY THIRD SECOND OF SITTING STILL, because the per-row entry
//     expired on home's refresh clock, so a screen nobody was touching re-parsed
//     a megabyte of JSON forever.
//
// A cache keyed by the SUBJECT over a reading that is GLOBAL is the shape of
// that bug: it multiplies one file read by the number of rows a person walks
// past. So the reading is taken once, filed by the conversation that made each
// file, and every card is a map lookup — which is the bargain
// homestanding.go's [app.standWeek] already makes for the week's ledger, in the
// same words.
//
// AND IT IS RE-PARSED ONLY WHEN THE FILE CHANGED. Home's beat asks for the
// reading three times a minute and gets one os.Stat for its trouble; the JSON is
// walked again only when a conversation has actually written a file since. So a
// resting screen costs nothing at all, and a file made a second ago still
// appears on home's own beat like every other arrival.

// homeArtifactIndex is that one reading: the machine's deliverables index, filed
// by the conversation that made each file, and the stat it was taken at so a
// beat can tell whether anything has happened since.
