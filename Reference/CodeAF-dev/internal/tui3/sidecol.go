// ── THE SIDE COLUMN: ONE COLUMN, TWO SOURCES ────────────────────────────────
//
// The right of every conversation is one column with one header, and the
// header is two words:
//
//	│ Tasks 14 · Traffic 3 new                  alt+l
//	│ ? @security asks: ship at p99 180ms?          the needs-you band
//	│ ✗ parser bench failed                         a failure, in ink
//	│ ────────────────────────────────────────────
//	│ Running 4
//	│   ⠙ rebase onto dev                   2m
//	│ Queued 3 ▸
//	│ Done 7 ▸
//
// THERE USED TO BE TWO COLUMNS AND A SPECIAL CASE BETWEEN THEM. An ordinary
// chat had the task column; a chat with a team manager in front had the
// Traffic instead, with the manager's own tasks behind a `Traffic · Tasks 2`
// word. Now there is this one component and it has two sources: the
// conversation's own work ([sideTasks], task.go's roster) and what passes in
// its team ([sideTraffic], sidetraffic.go). A chat that is in no team has only
// the first, and its header is the one word.
//
// THE CURRENT WORD IS BOLD INK AND THE OTHER IS DIM, and each is a door with a
// hover ground and a hint. The other word keeps its count, so what arrived in
// the Traffic while the tasks are in front is still on screen (`Traffic 3
// new`). Which word is in front is remembered for the session per kind of chat
// ([sideState.view]): a manager chat opens on the Traffic, every other chat on
// the tasks.
//
// THE BAND IS WHAT NEEDS THE PERSON NOW, from both sources ([app.sideBand]):
// a question or a packet waiting on them, a task whose next step is theirs,
// and a failure nobody has looked at yet. Amber is ONLY for the first kind,
// the items blocked on the person; a failure is a ✗ in ordinary ink. The band
// shows [sideBandCap] rows and then `+N more`, is gone entirely when there is
// nothing in it, and an item in it is not drawn again in the list under it.
// It pushes the list down and never the conversation: the column's width does
// not move for anything drawn in it.
//
// NOTHING HERE MOVES THE CONVERSATION. The column's width is decided by the
// frame's width and the person's own widen answer and by nothing it shows
// ([app.railColumns]), so switching words, folding a group, a row arriving
// and the band appearing all happen inside the column. Nothing here takes the
// keyboard either: alt+t hands it to the column, as it always has, and esc
// gives it back (task.go's [app.railKey]).
//
// THE FRAME DRAWS MEMORY. The Traffic is the cache teamtraffic.go's clock
// keeps, the tasks are the roster's nodes, and the rows the Traffic view lays
// are kept between frames ([sideTrafficCache]) until what they are drawn from
// moves.
