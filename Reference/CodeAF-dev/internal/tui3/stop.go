// STOPPING WORK, AND ASKING FIRST.
//
// Until this file the only thing on this surface that could end work was a
// sentence typed at the model: "stop task 7", and hope. Everything else —
// walking into a node, steering it, reading its transcript, watching what it
// costs — a person could do with their own hands, and the one act with a cost
// attached was the one they had to ask somebody else to do.
//
// So there is a key and there is a button, and between them and the work there
// is exactly one card.
//
//	 ?  Stop this run?
//	      In-flight nodes halt; partial results stay.
//	      1  stop it
//	      2  keep going
//	    [enter] take the pick · [esc] keep going · [←→] pick
//
// The block draws those rows (question.go) and this file owns the words in them.
// The head is the QUESTION and the row under it is the PROMISE — what stopping
// does not take away — on rows of their own, because one sentence carrying both
// said the promise twice. The answer the cursor is on is lit across its whole
// row and the whole row is pressable.
//
// ── THE CARD IS ALWAYS ASKED, AND ITS DEFAULT IS "NO" ──
//
// There is no bypass key, no modifier that skips the question, and no
// "don't ask me again". Stopping is not reversible — a cut node's turn is over
// and its context is gone — and every gesture on this surface that cannot be
// undone is confirmed once, in the same shape (permissions.go's floor states
// the general law). The CURSOR STARTS ON "keep going", which is the same rule
// said in the one place a person actually reads it: a card whose destructive
// answer is under the enter key is a card that stops work when somebody presses
// enter for the reason people press enter, which is to make a question go away.
//
// ── THE KEY AND THE POINTER ANSWER THE SAME CARD ──
//
// `x` raises it — on the roster's focused chip, and inside a room or a run's
// page — and a ✕ in the room's header and on the focused chip raises exactly
// the same card. One question, two hands, no second grammar: ←/→ walk the two
// answers, a DIGIT MOVES THE CURSOR onto the answer it names rather than giving
// it, enter takes the one under the cursor, esc is "keep going", and a press
// anywhere on an answer's row is that answer.
//
// `x` IS TAKEN OVER AN EMPTY BOX AND NOWHERE ELSE, which is the rule every key
// on this surface that is also a letter is held to (task.go's [app.taskKey],
// room.go). A room's box steers the worker in it; a page whose keys ate the
// sentence somebody was typing would be a page you cannot steer. The known cost
// is the one keystroke: `x` typed as the first letter of a sentence into a room
// raises the card instead of going in the box, and the card's default answer
// puts it away again with nothing else changed.
//
// ── AND ONE ROW NEEDS NO CURSOR AT ALL (#892) ──
//
// The roster's keyboard was made askable (`alt+t`) on the argument that "while
// the roster does not hold the keyboard there is no cursor and nothing is being
// aimed at" — and with three rows on screen that is exactly right: a bare `x`
// would have to guess which one, and guessing wrong ends an hour of work. But
// ONE stoppable row is the case the argument was written against and does not
// cover: there is nothing to choose between, so the keystroke cannot be aimed at
// the wrong thing, and the law the argument serves — one bare keystroke over a
// list should not be able to end an hour of work — is already satisfied by the
// card, which asks and defaults to *keep going*, not by the focus requirement.
// So with exactly one stoppable row visible, `x` raises that row's card without
// `alt+t` first. Two or more keep today's behaviour and fall through, because
// with nothing to aim at the only honest answer is the letter the key already
// is.
//
// ── ESC IS STILL BACK, AND NEVER STOP ──
//
// esc closes a card, then a room, then a page, in that order, and it never ends
// work. A dismiss key that also cancelled would make leaving a page a thing
// people did carefully.

// stopAgent is the one door onto ending work, whatever kind it is
// (internal/session's cancel.go). It is a fourth optional assertion on this
// surface for [taskRoomAgent]'s reason exactly: an agent that has never heard of
// stopping keeps everything else it had, and this surface says so in one note
// rather than drawing a button that could only fail.
