// THE LIVE EDGE.
//
// A stream arrives in lumps. waitEvent folds every delta that piled up while
// the last frame was being built, and some endpoints send a paragraph at a
// time. Showing the lump whole is honest — and it is also a block that pops.
// The eye reads that as the machine stalling and then dumping, not as writing.
//
// So the bytes are kept, and the EDGE is what moves. Each frame the live tail
// grows by a stride that is fast when the unread remainder is large and finer
// when it is small — catch up, then write. The curve is the welcome sweep's
// own ease-out (1 − (1 − t)²) said as a per-slot fraction: most of the debt
// goes in the first two frames, the last few characters write themselves.
//
// THE SURFACE PACES THE WIRE'S LUMPS, NEVER ITS OWN FOLD.
//
// That is the whole of which bursts walk, and the distinction is the one this
// file got wrong once already. A model streaming token by token is ALREADY
// writing: the wire is delivering a few characters at a time and the page
// should say them as they land. What pops is a single wire event carrying a
// paragraph — an endpoint that buffers, a link that stalled and then dumped —
// and that is the only thing worth walking.
//
// A FOLD IS NOT A LUMP. [waitEvent] joins the run of short deltas that piled up
// while the last frame was being built, and that run is an artefact of THIS
// side of the channel: the wire delivered it fine-grained. Holding it back
// would be the surface inventing latency the connection never had, which is
// exactly what it did — a token-by-token stream drew in slow motion, and
// twelve fixtures that assert what one delta puts on the page saw twelve bytes
// of it. So the fold is drawn as its parts would have drawn: whole, however
// long the run. Only a single wire event past [revealAtOnce] opens a walk, and
// the bytes of any later burst join a walk that is already running.
//
// A settle snaps whatever is left, because a finished answer that is still
// revealing is a lie — and so does every other door out of the live state
// (livestate.go states that law and owns the six of them). The linear tier
// never paces: it is the screen-reader tier, and an animation is a still
// photograph there (tui3.go's Options.Linear).
//
// THE WALK IS A FUNCTION OF TIME, NOT OF PICTURES. Every step below is taken
// in SLOTS of the paint clock, and the slots are measured from the surface's
// own clock seam ([app.now], which a test pins) rather than counted in frames
// painted. A frame is when the walk is DRAWN; how far it has got is what the
// clock says. That is what makes the pace the same over a link that paints ten
// times a second as at the machine that paints thirty, and it is why nothing
// in this file ever calls [time.Now].
//
//
// THE SAME CURVE WALKS THE METERS. A token count or a bill that jumps from
// one reading to the next is the same pop in a different column. The
// accounting stays exact; what is drawn eases toward it on this clock, and
// snaps the moment the turn is no longer running.

// revealAtOnce is how much a single wire event may carry and still land whole.
//
// THE REASON IS WHAT A PERSON CAN SEE, not a guess about wire shapes. Forty-
// eight bytes is about a short line, a dozen tokens; walking one takes a
// couple of frames and moves the edge by a few characters twice, which is
// motion nobody perceives as writing — it reads as the line simply appearing,
// only later. There is nothing to show, so there is nothing to hold back. Past
// this length a walk has something to say, and a burst that arrives in one
// piece is a burst the wire buffered rather than one it wrote.

// revealCatch is the fraction of the unread remainder one frame-slot takes,
// in thousandths. 450 is a strong ease-out: just under half the debt each

// UI budget — and a forty-byte tail writes itself a few characters at a time.
