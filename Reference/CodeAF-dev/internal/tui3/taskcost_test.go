// check — whose hands, what came home, what it cost — and it was the one the
// card could not say while nothing on the wire carried it. It does now
// (session's TaskNotice.CostUSD), and these are the rules it arrives under:
// inside the card rather than on its head, from the node's own reconciled
// figure rather than the raw notice, and ABSENT rather than $0.00 when nobody
// published a price.
