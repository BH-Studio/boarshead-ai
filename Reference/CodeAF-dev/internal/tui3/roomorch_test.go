// What these hold shut, in the order a person meets them: the shape (a snapshot
// becomes layers, and the layers are the launch order), the crystallizing (a
// node that arrived is marked, once), the drill-in (a chip is a card and a
// card's needs are doors), the gate (the run is out of fuel and three keys say
// what happens next), and the steer lane (words go to the planner, and the page
// says so before the planner has said anything back).

// orchFake is a session with an adaptive run under it: the three doors of
// [orchAgent], over snapshots a test rewrites between polls.
//
// It is a widening of [fakeAgent] rather than a fake of its own for the reason
// [roomFake] widens [taskFake]: the surface asserts the run doors separately
// from everything else it needs, so a fake that could not be a plain session
// would be testing a shape the surface never requires.
