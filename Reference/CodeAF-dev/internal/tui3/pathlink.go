// EVERY PATH A PERSON READS ON THIS SURFACE IS A DOOR, AND THE DOOR HAS TO BE
// THERE.
//
// A reply that says "I wrote it to internal/tui3/pathlink.go" is naming a file
// the reader almost always wants to open next, and until this file existed the
// name was dead text. A terminal will sometimes guess — cmd-click on a word
// that looks pathish — but the guess is made on ONE VISUAL LINE, so the moment
// the pane is narrow enough to wrap a long path the click grabs half of it and
// opens nothing. That is the defect: not that paths were unclickable, but that
// they were unreliably clickable, which is worse, because a person stops
// trying.
//
// So the surface writes the link itself, in OSC 8. An OSC 8 anchor carries the
// URI OUT OF BAND: the terminal is told the target once and the anchor text may
// then be any shape at all, including a path broken across three rows, and a
// click anywhere inside it opens the same file. The sequence occupies no cells,
// so nothing that measures a row has to know about it.
//
// ── THE HONESTY RULE: WE STAT IT ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A link that opens nothing is worse than no link — it is the surface claiming
// a door it does not have (the same law [linkifyTasks] is written under, where
// an unknown task id stays plain text). So NOTHING BECOMES A LINK UNTIL IT HAS
// BEEN FOUND ON DISK. The shape test ([looksPath]) is only the cheap reject
// that decides what is worth a stat; the stat is what decides.
//
// This is what keeps the pass out of trouble in the places a looser rule falls
// over. A unified diff's `a/internal/x.go` and `b/internal/x.go` are not files
// and there are no `a/` and `b/` directories to make them ones. `1/2`, `4:3`
// and `v2.0` are not files. An import path is not a file. None of them is
// special-cased anywhere in here; all of them simply fail to exist.
//
// ── WHAT IS NOT LINKED, AND WHY ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A MODEL MAY NOT MAKE A LINK. Everything a model or a tool writes is laundered
// through internal/sanitize on its way in (prose's sanitizeSource), and that
// strips every OSC there is, OSC 8 included — a reply carrying its own
// `\x1b]8;;https://evil.example` gets no hyperlink, and that is deliberate, not
// incidental. This pass runs AFTER the laundering, on rows the surface itself
// produced, so the only URIs on screen are ones codeaf resolved and checked.
// The target is always a path something confirmed exists — file:// at home, and
// the file door's own URL over a connection (see the far side's section below).
//
// A COMMAND'S OUTPUT IS NOT LINKED. Tool stdout is somebody else's program
// talking — a test runner, a compiler, `ls` — and the surface draws it verbatim
// on purpose. See [linker.rows] for the whole of that decision.
//
// ── ON THE FAR SIDE OF A CONNECTION THE ENGINE ANSWERS ──────────────────────
//
// A hosted session's workspace is on ANOTHER MACHINE, and `file:///app/main.go`
// handed to the terminal in front of you means this machine's /app/main.go. The
// two outcomes are a click that does nothing and a click that opens a stranger's
// file, and for one wave that was the reason this pass was switched off entirely
// over a connection — the same judgement the branch probe makes in [newApp].
//
// IT IS NOT OFF ANY MORE, AND NOTHING ABOUT THE LAW CHANGED — only who performs
// the stat and what the anchor points at. The stat is [remote.Client.StatPaths],
// asked in batches off the render path, answered under the same two-roots rule
// as everything else that crosses (remotefiles.go states the whole of it). The
// target is the file door's own capability URL rather than `file://`, because
// the whole objection to `file://` here was that it names the wrong machine's
// disk. A word the engine has not confirmed is plain text, exactly as a word
// this machine could not stat is plain text at home — the honesty rule is one
// rule and it now has two people who can answer it.
//
// A CONFIRMED DIRECTORY IS STILL NOT LINKED over a connection, and a hosted
// session resolves no `~`: that tilde is THIS machine's home and the file is on
// the other one, which is the one substitution this pass may never make.

// sgrUnderOn and sgrUnderOff are the underline attribute, spelled once. SGR 4
// is in the original ECMA-48 set, so every terminal above the one that draws no
// SGR at all understands it — which is why [palette.underline] asks the colour
// profile and nothing else.

	sgrUnderOn  = "\x1b[4m"

// pathWordMax is the longest word this pass will carry to a stat. It is a bound
// on WORK rather than a judgement about names: a row of a hundred columns of
// base64 is one word, it is not a path, and finding that out should not cost a
// syscall.
const pathWordMax = 512

// pathChainMax is how many CELLS of reassembled text one split path may be put
// back together from. It was a count of ROWS, and a row is the wrong unit for
// the thing it is bounding.
//
// It is a bound on WORK and not a judgement about names: each extension is one
// more stat. But how many rows a path takes is a fact about the FRAME, not
// about the path — the same name is three rows at 160 columns and ten at 28 —
// so a row bound is loosest exactly where paths are shortest and tightest
// exactly where the narrow frame this whole pass exists for needs it most. A
// generated file a few directories deep stopped being a link at 28 columns
// while remaining one at 55, which is the opposite of the intended behaviour.
//
// Measured in cells the bound says what it means: text longer than this is not
// a name, whatever width it was drawn at. It is [pathWordMax], because that is
// this file's already-written-down answer to how long a name can be, and two
// numbers for one idea is how they come to disagree.
const pathChainMax = pathWordMax

// pathSeenMax bounds the memo. A conversation that has named four thousand
// distinct words is a conversation whose oldest answers are far off screen, and
// dropping the lot costs one stat each the next time any of them is drawn.
const pathSeenMax = 4096

// fileURI is the ONE spelling of a file link on this surface.
//
// It is built through net/url rather than by concatenation because a path is
// allowed to contain the characters a URI is not — a space, a '#', a '?' — and
// `"file://" + path` hands the terminal a URI that stops at the first one of
// them. The authority is left empty (`file:///Users/...`), which is the form
// every terminal that implements OSC 8 reads; naming a host is a claim about

// THE LONGEST CHAIN THAT NAMES SOMETHING WINS, and it is worth saying why the
// obvious tie-break is the wrong one. Asking at each step and stopping at the
// first yes sounds cheaper and is a bug, because the prefixes of a path are
// DIRECTORIES and directories exist: a name broken after `…/001/internal`
// resolves, so a first-yes rule would link four rows of a seven-row path to the
// folder two levels above the file. The chain therefore runs to
// [pathChainMax] — the walk is bounded, the stats are memoized, and the last
// answer is kept.
//
// The chain stops early at a continuation that ended before its row did: that
// row's wrap broke on a space, so there was no split, and there is nothing left
// for a longer chain to pick up.
