// The four defects this slice closed, each pinned by the behaviour a person
// reported rather than by the code that answers it:
//
//   - a model slot in the settings panel opens THE picker, not a plainer list
//     that looks like one;
//   - the context-reuse row says what its 250 means;
//   - a model you cannot talk to is not on offer anywhere the picker draws;
//   - the filter ranks prefix over substring over subsequence, and a query of
//     several words narrows rather than fails.

// mixedModels is a catalog with one of everything the door can hand over: text
// models, a drawing model that also writes (the shape that got past the old
// gate), models that answer in speech and video, and two rows that publish no
// modalities at all — the cache written before the field existed.
