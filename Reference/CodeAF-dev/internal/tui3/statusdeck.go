// ── THE PHONE'S STATUS DECK ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The HUD's status is ONE ROW that carries eleven different facts, and it holds
// them by dropping whichever ones do not fit ([dropOrder]). At forty-four
// columns that ladder has nothing left to give: the identity alone is wider
// than the frame, and every number a person opened the terminal to read has
// been dropped before the first segment is drawn.
//
// So at [tierPhone] the row becomes a DECK OF TWO, and the two rows carry the
// two questions a phone-width frame can actually answer at a glance:
//
//	 Fix the nil-map crash          $0.31 · 12%
//	 deepseek-v4-flash        ⏺ 2 running ▸
//
//	row 1   WHAT THIS IS, and WHAT IT HAS COST — the session's name against its
//	        spend and how full it is
//	row 2   WHAT IS ANSWERING, and WHAT IS STILL MOVING — the model chip against
//	        the ambient counts and the state word
//
// The cluster law is the wide row's own: identity left, telemetry right, the
// gap between them as the only separator. Nothing crosses.
//
// AND NOTHING IS DROPPED — it is MOVED. Everything the wide row can carry that
// these two cannot (the contextual key hints, the watch and queue counts, the
// session's diffstat, the cache share, the burn rate, the compaction forecast,
// the workspace and its branch) is one tap away in a fullscreen sheet that
// lists every one of them, one per line. A narrow ladder that silently deletes
// facts teaches a person the numbers are unreliable; a ladder that relocates
// them teaches them where to look.
//
// THE DECK IS TWO ROWS ALWAYS, deterministically, and never one or three. The
// wide row's second row is WRAP-DRIVEN — it appears only when the clusters
// would collide — and a chrome height that has to run the layout to find out
// how tall it is has one more way to disagree with the frame. Here the tier
// decides it: [layoutTier] says phone, the deck is [deckHeight] rows, and
// [app.statusHeight] answers from the tier without laying anything out.
