// ── THE HOME PLACE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THIS FILE IS HOME AS A PLACE (docs/design/home-rethink/ARCHITECTURE.md): the
// switcher it reads, the verbs its rows offer, and the card beside a typed
// search. The reading is switcher.go's and is PURE; the frame
// around it is the router's and knows no place by name; nothing here switches on
// a page id, and the shared router files carry a call into this file rather than
// a home-shaped body.
//
// ── WHERE HOME'S `place` METHODS ALREADY LIVE ───────────────────────────────
//
// The interface itself is the refactor lane's, and these are the functions it
// binds to, written down here so that lane has one list rather than a search:
//
//	id       pageHome
//	open     [app.openHome]        home.go — reads the world, the bands and the
//	                               ledger once, then builds
//	close    [app.closeHome]       home.go — writes the look stamp
//	tick     [app.refreshHome]     home.go — the three-second beat
//	body     [app.homeBody]        home.go, the grid in homegrid.go
//	stops    [homeLine.stop]       home.go
//	enter    [app.homeEnter]       home.go — the doors and their refusals
//	verbs    [app.homeRowVerbs]    HERE
//	alt      —                     the grid is home's one shape
//	window   —                     home has no time window
//	box      [homeView.box]        the one foot box: filter and message at once
//	note     —                     each panel says its own count
//	hint     [app.homeHint]        home.go
//	changed  —                     the per-place look stamps are another lane's
//
// The state struct is [homeView] (home.go), which the refactor lane renames; it
// is not moved here in this wave because four hundred lines of doors, clock and
// typed surface still hold it.
//
// ── HOME IS A SWITCHER, NOT A DIRECTORY ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// Home used to be a tree: every project a heading, its conversations under it,
// three open and the rest folded away under a rule, with two attention strips
// standing over the whole thing. That shape answers "where is my work", and the
// person opening this screen twenty times a day is not asking that. Seconds
// between opens, ten to twenty live chats, three to five projects — so the tree
// bought five rows of scaffolding to reach twenty leaves, and the two strips
// said a second time what the list was already saying once.
//
// SO THE LIST IS ONE FLAT RANKED LIST (SCREEN 1a): what needs you, then what is
// moving, then what is quiet, with the project demoted to a tag on the row and
// the right-hand note carrying the one fact the card was really for. NEEDS-YOU
// AND MOVING ARE THE SORT ORDER NOW, which is why the strips are gone rather
// than moved: a summary standing over a list sorted the same way is the same
// reading twice.
//
// THE READING IS switcher.go's AND THIS FILE OWNS ONLY THE WIRING. [readSwitcher]
// is pure — a world, the standing bands, a look stamp and a clock in, a list of
// lines out — and everything this file does is turn those lines into lines of
// home's own column so that every door, card, digit and key that already worked
// on a conversation or a standing item goes on working on it untouched. A
// switcher row for a conversation IS a [homeSession] row; a switcher row for a
// watch IS a [homeItem] row, painted from the panel cell it wears (homegrid.go).
//
// AND TYPING IS UNTOUCHED. The moment there is something in the box the column
// is [homeView.buildWorld]'s drop-up again, ranked by [homeRank], with `ask
// here` and the action row against the foot — "type to search or start" is the
// promise the foot has always made and this wave does not touch it.

// The row kinds the switcher adds, declared HERE and given values far above the
// iota block in home.go for [homePlace]'s reason: that block is edited by other
// lanes in the same wave, and a constant appended to it would be a conflict over
// a line that says nothing.
const (
	// homeLedger is one line of `since you left` — a watch that fired, work that
	// landed, something memory learned. IT IS A DOOR AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT

	// than by inventories, so you learn the memory place exists on the day it
	// tells you it learned something, and enter on the line goes there.
