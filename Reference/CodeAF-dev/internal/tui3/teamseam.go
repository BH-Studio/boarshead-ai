// ── THE TEAMS SEAM: WHERE THE TEAMS FILE AND THE TRAFFIC ARE ─────────────────
//
// A team's file and its Traffic logs belong to the machine the SESSION runs
// on, because the team tools a model calls (internal/session) read and write
// them in that machine's profile. On a local launch that is this machine's
// profile; over --host it is the far machine's, and this window's own profile
// is somewhere the manager never looks. So the interface does not open the
// store itself. It asks through [TeamsSeam]: the local one wraps
// internal/teams at the profile directory ([localTeams]), and the --host door
// hands one that asks the engine over the wire (cmd/codeaf's hostTeams).
//
// EVERY CALL THAT MAY WAIT IS MADE OFF THE LOOP. An edit is made to what the
// window holds at once, so the strip and the wall show it on the keystroke,
// and queued; the queue is written by one command beside the loop's own
// ([app.teamsWrite]), on the ordered door line, so two edits reach the file in
// the order they were made. The Traffic clock's reads are made by its own
// command ([app.trafficNext]). The one call made on the loop is
// [TeamsSeam.Load], at an opening, and it must not block: locally it is one
// small file (the fourth law's `open`), and over a connection it answers what
// is held and asks the engine behind itself.
//
// A WINDOW THAT CANNOT REACH THE SESSION'S TEAMS HAS NONE, IT DOES NOT BORROW
// THIS MACHINE'S. Over --host with an engine that predates the teams doors the
// door hands no seam, and [app.teamsOff] turns the team writes and the manager
// off with [teamHostedWord] (host.go's honesty table).

// TeamsSeam is the teams file and the Traffic logs of the machine the session
// runs on, as functions (the reason [StandingSeam] gives). The zero value is
// this machine's own profile, which is every local launch.
type TeamsSeam struct {
	// Load is the teams as held, coloured around reserved, and the file's stamp
	// (internal/teams' stamp.go). It is asked on the loop, at an opening, and

	// It may block.
	ReadSince func(since string, reserved []float64) (teams []teamstore.Team, stamp string, same bool, err error)
	// Update is the store's read-modify-write: change is made to the file as
	// it is, and what was written and its stamp come back. change may be made
	// more than once (a write over a wire that met another writer reads and
	// makes it again), so it depends only on the file it is handed. It may
	// block.
	Update func(change func(*teamstore.File) error) (teams []teamstore.Team, stamp string, err error)

	// ── DELEGATION (DESIGN.md section 8) ──
	//
	// The doors below are the delegation store of the same machine: its
	// `teams.` defaults, its decision packets, a team's spend and the delete
	// that removes a closed team's files. Every one of them may block and is
	// asked off the loop. Over --host against an engine without
	// [remote.Welcome.Delegation] they are nil, and [TeamsSeam.delegation]
	// says so: the window then says the inbox and the spend are not available
	// over that connection, and never reads this machine's packet files.
	// Closing and reopening a team are not doors of their own: they are
	// [teamstore.File.Close] and [teamstore.File.Reopen] made through Update.

	// Defaults is the five `teams.` defaults, for a card's `· from Settings`.
	Defaults func() (teamstore.Defaults, error)

	ApplyDefault func(key, raw string) (teamstore.Defaults, error)

	// ── THE TEAMS PAGE (place_teams.go) ──
	//
	// Two more doors, OPTIONAL: a seam without them is a seam, and the page says

	// no wire answers them yet, so cmd/codeaf's hostTeams leaves them nil.

	// only, and the close card says so.
