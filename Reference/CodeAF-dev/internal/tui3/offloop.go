// ── EVERY DOOR IS ASKED OFF THE LOOP ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE LAW. A door on the agent — answering a question, writing a rule, taking up
// a conversation's record — is a CALL TO ANOTHER PROCESS. Bare `codeaf` runs its
// engine in a session host and talks to it over a socket, so this is true of
// every window and not only of `--host` (cmd/codeaf's chatv3_local.go). A call
// made from Update is a call the window cannot draw during, cannot take a key
// during, and cannot even read the news of its own answer during — which is how
// one keystroke came to cost ten seconds (doorbell.go tells that story from the
// other end). So no door is asked from Update. It is asked from the command
// Update hands back, and what it said is folded in on the next pass.
//
// WHAT THE PERSON SEES IS DECIDED IMMEDIATELY, WITHOUT WAITING TO BE TOLD. The
// question closes and writes its receipt on the keystroke ([app.closeQuestion]),
// because this window knows what it just sent and a row that sat unchanged for a
// round trip is a row somebody presses twice. If the door then refuses, the fold
// puts the question back with the door's own sentence
// ([app.reopenQuestion]) — the rare road, drawn honestly, rather than the
// common one paid for in frozen frames.
//
// AND A FOLD KNOWS WHETHER IT IS STILL LOOKING AT THE SAME CONVERSATION. A
// person can switch away between the keystroke and the answer; putting the old
// conversation's question back on the new conversation's screen would be this
// surface inventing a question. So the fold is told `here`, which is false when
// the window has moved on, and a fold with something to release — a subscription
// taken by a door that was asked for a conversation nobody is looking at any
// more — releases it there.
//
// [TestAnAnswerOverAConnectionAsksTheFarMachineNothingFromUpdate] is the runtime
// law, and offlooplaw_test.go is the structural one: a door named here may not
// be called outside an [app.offLoop] literal, or an [app.besideLine] one for a
// read nobody pressed for.

// doorMsg is what one door said, on its way back to the update loop.
//
// IT CARRIES THE FOLD AND NOT THE ANSWER. Every door answers something different
// — an error, a record and a stream, nothing at all — and a message per door
// would be a message type per door plus a case in [app.Update] for each. What
// they have in common is the only thing this loop needs: a piece of work to do
// with what came back, on the loop, for the conversation it was asked of.
type doorMsg struct {
	// front is [app.frontGen] when the door was asked: which conversation this
	// window was looking at.
	front int
	fold  func(here bool) tea.Cmd
}

// offLoop asks one door off the update loop and folds what it said back in.
//
// `ask` runs on the door line's goroutine and may take as long as the engine
// takes; it hands back the fold, which runs on the loop and may touch the
// surface. Nothing in `ask` may touch the surface, and nothing in the fold may
// call a door — the two halves are exactly that split.
//
// THE ASK IS PUT IN THE LINE HERE, ON THE LOOP, AND THAT IS WHAT ORDERS IT.
// Commands are started on goroutines of their own in whatever order the runtime
// feels like, so a door asked from a command was a door that could overtake the
// one asked a keystroke earlier: `D` batches the rule and the answer, and the
// answer resuming the turn could re-ask the question before the rule it was
// supposed to be written under existed. Queuing on the loop means the wire sees
// what a person did in the order they did it ([doorLine]).

// besideLine asks one door off the update loop AND OFF THE ORDERED LINE, and
// folds what it said back in exactly as [app.offLoop] does.
//
// NOTHING A PERSON DID NOT PRESS STANDS IN THE LINE. The line exists for one
// reason: the engine must see a person's gestures in the order they made them.
// A read nobody pressed for has no place in that order, and one that waits on a
// model has no business in front of it. The run's summary is that read: a
// sentence written under a budget of seconds ([app.refreshRunSummary]). Asked
// through the line it stood in front of whatever a person did next, and on a
// real screen a press on a run's row waited 7.6 seconds for a read that took
// two milliseconds. A stop pressed in that window would have waited the same.
//
// WHAT MAY COME HERE IS DECIDED BY PROPERTY, not by how slow a door feels: the
// ask was not a gesture, and nothing a person does next depends on the engine
// having seen it first. A gesture never comes here, however slow its door is,
// because its place in the order is the whole of what the line is for.
//
// It runs on the command's own goroutine, which is what every door did before
// the line existed; what it gives up is the order, and it had none to keep.

// ── THE DOOR LINE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ONE QUEUE, ONE GOROUTINE, IN THE ORDER THE KEYS WERE PRESSED. Every door this
// surface asks is a call to another process, and two of them in flight at once
// arrive in whichever order two goroutines happen to be scheduled. That is not
// a race about speed — it is a race about MEANING: the rule a person wrote with
// `D` and the answer they gave in the same keystroke are one gesture, and the
// engine reading them backwards re-asks a question the rule had just settled.
//
// So the asks go into a line as they are made — which is on the update loop,
// under the keystroke that made them — and one goroutine walks it. A door is
// still never called from the loop: what the loop does is put a job on a slice
// and ring a one-slot channel, neither of which can block on the engine.
