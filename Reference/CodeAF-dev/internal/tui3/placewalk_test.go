// WALKING BETWEEN THE PLACES.
//
// The owner's report against the real binary: "in home left right does not seem
// to move tabs, only shift does". The cause was not the arrows — it was `tab`
// walking into the tasks place, being refused because this machine had run no
// work, and being put straight back on home. Every press did that, so the
// circle had one member and `shift+tab` (which lands on settings, and settings
// always opened) was the only key that appeared to work.
//
// THE WALK ANSWERED IT BY STEPPING PAST A SHUT ROOM. Then the refusals went
// (pages.go's [app.showPage]), and with them the idea of a shut room — so the
// walk is `tab` and nothing else again, and what these tests pin is that the
// circle is the whole set and that every step of it lands.

// TAB WALKS THE WHOLE CIRCLE AND EVERY ROOM ON IT OPENS. On a surface with no
// brain, no store and nothing run, all four still take the frame — and the three
// off the bar, reached by their digits, take it too.
