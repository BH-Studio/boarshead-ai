//
// Why hex rather than internal/tui2/tokens (which this file used to delegate
// to): tokens is the v2 identity ramp, tuned for a rail of coloured cards, and
// D11 asks this surface for a quieter one. Detection is still tokens' — the
// profile question ("what can this terminal say") has one answer in this tree
// and it is [tokens.DetectProfile]; only the answer to "which colour" moved
// here. The spinner frames stay tokens' too: they are a glyph set, not a hue.
//
// The fallback ladder, and what each rung costs:
//
//	TrueColor  the palette exactly as authored — 38;2;r;g;b
//	ANSI256    the nearest member of the xterm cube+grey ramp, computed once at
//	           init by [nearest256]. Pastels land on soft indices; nothing in
//	           the table resolves into 0-15, which are whatever the user's theme
//	           says they are
//	ANSI16     NO HUE AT ALL. The sixteen are the terminal's own theme and its
//	           reds and greens are loud by definition, so this rung answers with
//	           weight instead: bold for what leads, faint for what recedes,
//	           plain for the body. Every distinction D11 draws in colour is also
//	           drawn in text (+/−, ✗, "exit 2"), so nothing is lost but the tint
//	NoColor    no SGR at all, weight included: a terminal told not to style is
//	           not styled halfway
//
// ── THERE IS NO FIFTH COLOUR, AND THE VIOLET IS RETIRED ──
//
// A question had a hue of its own here for a year — a violet (#C08FE8 dark,
// #6F3FA8 light), reserved for the moment the agent is WAITING FOR A PERSON and
// spent on the whole of it: the head, every answer, every key, the word in the
// status line. The owner retired it on 2026-09-11 (colour pick C) and the reason
// was not the hue. It was the AREA: home and the places had always said the same
// "waiting on you" in amber on ONE MARK, so the one object a person must act on
// was the one thing this surface said in two vocabularies, and a block painted
// four rows deep in a colour nobody else used read as an alarm rather than as a
// question.
//
// SO THE QUESTION IS AMBER AND THE AMBER IS STROKE, NEVER FILL. [palette.ask]
// paints with `warn` — the same amber every other surface already spent on
// waiting — and it touches the marks alone: the `?` at the head, the `▸` the
// pointer stands on, the `◆` beside a recommendation. The words are ink and the
// asides are dim, exactly as they are in a paragraph of conversation, because a
// question IS a paragraph of the conversation and its frame is what says it is
// one object. A law test in this package fails a row painted in the hue.
//
// ── THE SIGNAL BAND, AND THE TWO TIERS THAT ARE NOT IN IT ───────────────────
//
// The table divides in two, and the division is the reason a surface can carry
// seven colours and still read calm.
//
// The SIGNAL hues — accent, add, del, bad, ask, warn — answer "what KIND of
// thing is this". None of them outranks the others, so none of them may be
// LIGHTER than the others: the eye reads lightness as figure and ground and
// hue as identity, so a palette whose signals sit at one lightness reads as a
// single grey field at a glance and only resolves into colours when a person
// actually looks. THE SIGNAL HUES SIT INSIDE A FIFTEEN-POINT HSL LIGHTNESS
// BAND, on both ladders, and TestTheSignalHuesAreIsoluminant holds them to it.
// Dark: L 61–76. Light: L 39–53. Anything authored into this table from here
// on owes that check as well as the 256-neighbour one.
//
// The READING tiers — live, ink, muted, dim — answer "how loudly is this being
// said", and they are a LADDER by construction: the sentence still arriving,
// the body, the surface's second voice, and the surface talking about itself.
// Lightness is the whole of their meaning, so the band deliberately does not
// govern them and the test excludes them by name rather than by silence.
//
// #C67173 rather than nord's own #BF616A, which this table carried for four
// waves, is the one move that band cost. At L 56.5 the minus lines of a diff
// sat a clear five points under everything else in the signal set and read as a
// dimmer class of fact than the plus lines beside them, which is not what a
// diff means. The hue and the saturation are held (H 354→359, S 42); only the
// lightness rose, to L 61, and the 256 neighbour was re-checked: 167, a brick
// red, one clear step from [hueBad]'s 173. The obvious alternative, L 62, lands
// on 168 — a pink — and a diff whose minus lines went pink on every
// 256-colour terminal is the fallback nobody looked at, again.
//
// ── THE GLARE LAW ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE BODY MAY NOT BE THE BRIGHTEST THING ON THE SCREEN. The reading tier's top
// rung is the one colour a person looks at for minutes at a time, and on a dark
// terminal a white much above 11:1 stops being legible and starts being a lamp:
// the strokes halate, the counters fill in, and everything quieter beside it
// reads as switched off. Comfortable long-read contrast on the assumed grounds
// is 8–11:1, and TestTheBodyInkDoesNotGlare holds BOTH ladders to it.
//
// THERE IS EXACTLY ONE EXCEPTION AND IT IS NAMED: [hueLive], the tier a reply
// wears WHILE IT IS STILL ARRIVING, stands above the ceiling on purpose. The law
// is about a colour somebody reads for MINUTES; the live tier is transient by
// construction — it exists for the seconds a turn is streaming and drains back
// to the body ink the moment the turn settles, which is the only reason a
// paragraph is allowed to lead at all (THE ACCENT BUDGET above). An exception
// with no bound of its own is a hole rather than an exception, so live carries a
// ceiling of its own: IT MAY NEVER CLIMB BACK INTO THE WHITE THIS WAVE TOOK
// AWAY. tokens' own body tier #E6E6F0 measures 13.79:1 against the middle of the
// assumed dark range and is the glare this whole law was written about;
// TestTheLiveTierIsTheGlareLawsOneException holds live under it, and holds the
// STEP itself — live over ink — inside adaptive.go's [liveStep], so a future
// retune cannot push the streaming text into glare by widening the gap either.
//
// #C6CDDA rather than the #D8DEE9 this table carried for five waves. At 14.05:1
// against #101014 the ink was half again as bright as the person's own accent
// (9.26:1 at the middle of the range), so the loudest thing on a surface whose
// accent budget is ONE LIT ELEMENT PER SCREEN was the paragraph — and the budget
// bought nothing, because whatever it was spent on was outshone by the text
// around it. The move is the smallest one that fixes that: THE HUE IS HELD at
// 219°, the lightness comes down L 88.0 → 81.6, and the saturation eases 28 →
// 21 because a body white is the one colour here with no identity to carry, and
// a tint nobody can name is a tint paid for in contrast.
//
//	ground    #101014  #1a1b26  #1e1e2e
//	#D8DEE9   14.05    12.65    12.14   was: a lamp
//	#C6CDDA   11.88    10.70    10.27   is:  a page
//
// The 256 neighbour was re-checked, because that is where an unchecked change
// silently becomes a different colour. #C6CDDA resolves to 252, and 252 is
// claimed by nothing on either ladder. The near misses are worth naming: the old
// ink's own 254 is the LIGHT ladder's selected ground and 255 is its cursor
// step, so a body ink that drifted back up a rung would be sharing an index with
// furniture. Any future change here owes the same check.
//
// THE LADDER STILL READS AS A LADDER, which is the other half of the law: ink
// 10.70, muted 6.67, dim 3.54 against the middle of the assumed range — three
// clear steps, ink still a wide step above the second voice. Coming down far
// enough to be comfortable without arriving on top of [hueMuted] is the whole
// width of the move.
//
// The LIGHT ladder's body ink is untouched at #3B4252 — 10.06:1 against #FFFFFF
// and 8.73:1 against nord's #ECEFF4. It was measured against the same band and
// was already inside it, and A VALUE IN BAND IS NOT TOUCHED, which is the rule
// THE GROUND LADDER's own retune stated. The law's test walks both ladders
// regardless, so the light side cannot drift out of band unnoticed either.
//
// ── AND THE TRANSCRIPT REACHES IT THROUGH A SEAM ──
//
// Authoring the ink here is only half the fix. A model's markdown is rendered by
// internal/tui2/prose, which resolves every colour on the row from
// internal/tui2/tokens, whose body tier is #E6E6F0 — brighter again than the
// white this table used to carry. Two whites shared one screen and the louder
// one painted the thing people read most.
//
// So markdown.go hands prose a Styler carrying THIS ink
// ([tokens.Styler.WithBodyInk]; [hue.tokenColor] below is the conversion), and a
// reply's paragraphs, its headings and its inline code spans all come back
// wearing the value above. The v2 surface keeps tokens' own white, because the
// override travels on the Styler and never touches the table.
//
// ── THE ACCENT BUDGET ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ONE LIT ELEMENT PER SCREEN. The accent is the loudest thing this palette can
// say, and its whole worth is that a person's eye goes to it without being
// asked — which is a budget, not a colour. Spend it twice and it buys nothing.
//
// So the accent marks THE ONE LIVE OR CHOSEN THING and nothing else. HEADINGS
// ARE NOT THAT: a heading is furniture, it is in the same place every time, and
// a column of lit headings is a screen with no answer to "where am I". They
// wear [hueMuted] — the same hue one step back, which reads as structure rather
// than as a summons. The person's own › glyph and the rail keep the accent
// because they are where the eye starts and where the work is.
//
// docs/DESIGN-LANGUAGE.md states the budget in prose. No test can hold it: a
// screen is composed at fifty call sites and "how many lit things does this
// frame have" is not a question a unit test can ask. It is held by review, and
// by the fact that it is written down in two places on purpose.

// tier16 is what a sixteen-colour terminal draws instead of a hue.
type tier16 uint8

const (
	flat  tier16 = iota // no attribute: the body

// tokens' brighter own (see THE GLARE LAW above, and markdown.go). Nothing else
// in this package hands a colour out; the palette is closed in both directions.
//
// The 256 index is deliberately NOT handed across with it. tokens resolves the
// neighbour itself, with its own metric, and the two answers have to agree or a
// 256-colour terminal is back to two whites — so the agreement is ASSERTED, by
// TestTheTranscriptBodyWearsTheSurfacesOwnInk, rather than papered over by
// shipping our answer to a question we were not asked.

	hueInk = mustHue("#C6CDDA", flat)

	//
	// INK SETTLES WHEN THE TURN ENDS. A streaming answer is THE ONE LIVE THING ON
	// THE SCREEN, which is precisely what THE ACCENT BUDGET above says may lead —
	// and the budget also says the accent itself may not be spent on it, because
	// nothing the model writes is ever painted in the person's own hue (render.go
	// states that law over the user entry). So the live moment is drawn the only
	// way left that says "this is the growing edge" without saying "this is a
	// different kind of thing": ONE LIGHTNESS STEP, on the READING ladder, in the
	// body's own hue. When the turn settles the entry re-renders at the body ink
	// and the brightness drains away — no spinner, no checkmark, no glyph added
	// and none taken away, which is the emptiness law kept through a transition
	// rather than around it.
	//
	// It is a READING tier and not a signal, so the fifteen-point isoluminant
	// band above deliberately does not govern it, exactly as it does not govern
	// ink, muted and dim: lightness IS the whole of its meaning.
	//
	// ── WHY THE HEX IS THE INK'S OWN OLD VALUE ─────────────────────────────────
	//
	// #D8DEE9 is what [hueInk] carried before the readability wave calmed the
	// body down to #C6CDDA, and taking it here is not a coincidence: a tier
	// defined as "one step above the body" has to be authored RELATIVE to the
	// body, and the step the body just vacated is the step that was already
	// measured, already inside the palette's "nothing bright" law, and already
	// proven readable for four waves. Live is the ink the surface used to speak
	// in; the settled body is the calmer ink it speaks in now.
	//
	// THE DEPENDENCY IS STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN. This hue is only ever ONE STEP
	// above whatever [hueInk] carries, and if the two ever meet the effect is
	// simply ABSENT — a streaming reply then looks exactly as it looked before
	// this existed. That is the right failure and the tests are written to allow
	// it (settle_test.go asserts live ≥ ink, not live > ink), because the pair is
	// one retune: a live tier that leapt above an un-calmed body would be the
	// "bright" this file's first rule forbids. It is also what the adaptive
	// derivation does on a ground with no headroom left (adaptive.go).
	//
	// ── THE 256 NEIGHBOUR, CHECKED ─────────────────────────────────────────────
	//
	// #D8DEE9 resolves to 254, on the GREY RAMP rather than into the colour cube,
	// which is what a reading tier owes: a body that rounded into a tint would be
	// prose that looked like it meant something. Against the dark ladder's other
	// roles 254 is clear by a wide margin — the nearest occupied index in the
	// whole table is [hueDim]'s 243, and every signal hue lands in the cube
	// (140, 144, 146, 167, 173, 186, 110). The ONE index it comes near is
	// [hueInk]'s own, which is 252 now that the body has settled at #C6CDDA —
	// one clear step down the same grey ramp, which is the collision check
	// passing exactly when the effect exists and failing into absence when it
	// does not. #C08FE8's note above is why this check is written down and not
	// merely done.
	//
	// ── DEGRADATION ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
	//
	// The tier is `flat`, and that is the whole of the ANSI16 answer: BELOW THE
	// 256 RUNG THE EFFECT IS SIMPLY ABSENT. Every other hue in this table falls
	// back to weight, and this one may not — WEIGHT BELONGS TO MARKDOWN
	// (render.go), so bolding a live reply would make a streaming answer
	// indistinguishable from one whose author opened with a bold lead-in, and
	// faint would say the opposite of what the tier means. With no hue to spend
	// there is nothing honest to degrade to, so nothing is drawn. NO_COLOR is the
	// same answer for the ordinary reason: a terminal told not to style is not
	// styled halfway.

	// what it paints elsewhere — a tool's name, a heading, a band label, each a
	// word or two of LABEL — but narration is paragraphs, and paragraphs of blue
	// prose over an accent-blue question read as one blue field with the answer
	// somewhere inside it. Prose is a READING role, and the reading ladder's law
	// is that lightness is the whole of its meaning — so narration takes the
	// BODY'S own hue family (H 221 against the ink's 219) at a saturation a
	// person cannot name (S 16 against muted's 41), one lightness step under the
	// second voice: 5.2:1 against the middle of the assumed dark range, between

	// the answer chips in a violet of their own, the "finished, needs your look"
	// glyph in this amber — which meant the screen had two ways to say the one

	// first, and on 2026-09-11 the owner moved the conversation's questions onto
	// it as well (colour pick C): [palette.ask] paints with this hue, on a

	//
	// A deadline thirty seconds out is not a failure and

	// tried was [hueInk], and ink is the BODY's colour: a "lifted" datum two
	// rows under a paragraph of ink read as ordinary text, which is the exact
	// defect the payload rule was written against, arriving one rung later. The
	// eye reads lightness as loudness and HUE as identity, so a datum needs a
	// hue of its own — the syntax-highlighting contract every calm terminal
	// theme already keeps: greyscale for prose, colour for identifiers.
	//
	// Nord's frost cyan, at L 70.0 inside the fifteen-point signal band, so a
	// line full of data still reads as one quiet field until somebody looks.

	// ── WHY L 70 AND NOT NORD'S OWN L 67.5 ─────────────────────────────────────
	//
	// #88C0D0 is the hex nord authors and this table carried for four waves, and
	// on the rung where hues are rounded it was not a cyan at all: it resolves to
	// xterm-256 110, which is #87afd7 — A STEEL BLUE, and the SAME INDEX
	// [hueMuted] rounds to. So on every 256-colour terminal the datum wore the
	// second voice's own colour, which is the one thing a hue given out for
	// IDENTITY may not do: the payload rule lifts a model id out of a dim line by
	// giving it a hue of its own, and a lifted datum painted in the tier it was
	// lifted out of is the rule doing nothing while appearing to work.
	//
	// The move is the smallest one that fixes it and it is THE MOVE THIS FILE
	// ALWAYS MAKES: the hue is held at 193°, the saturation at 43%, and only the
	// LIGHTNESS rises, L 67.5 → 70.0. That crosses onto 116 — #87d7d7, which is
	// an actual cyan and is claimed by nothing on either ladder — and it is the
	// first index above #88C0D0 that is: L 69.0 still rounds to 110 and L 73.0 has
	// gone on to 152. The signal band is unmoved, because the spread it measures
	// is [hueDel]'s L 61.0 to [hueAccent]'s L 75.9 and this value sits inside
	// both ends. Contrast against the middle of the assumed dark range goes 8.54
	// → 9.07, which leaves it under the accent's 9.26 — a datum may not outrank
	// the person's own hue.
	//
	// 116 is also one clear step from the accent's 146, which was the collision
	// this line was originally checked against and remains the one that would
	// matter most: a datum painted the person's own colour would spend the accent
	// budget forty times a minute by rounding. Both checks are now written down
	// rather than merely done — TestNoTwoRolesShareA256Index walks the whole

// ── THE GROUND LADDER ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Everything above this line is an INK. What follows is the other kind of
// colour this surface draws: the GROUND under a row. There are four steps,
// they are the only four there will ever be, and they are named here once.
//
//	rest      NO GROUND AT ALL — the row is the terminal's own background
//	cursor    the row the pointer is over, or the row the cursor is on
//	selected  the chosen thing: the current row, the current chip
//	mark      a marked span: copy mode's selection, and the text a yank takes
//
// REST IS NOT A COLOUR, AND THAT IS THE LAW — ON THE CONVERSATION AND ON EVERY
// PLACE ALIKE. It has no entry in the tables below because there is nothing to
// author: an unremarkable row is painted by not painting it. This is the
// emptiness law wearing its background clothes — a surface that tinted every row
// would be a surface where a tint said nothing, and the three steps that DO say
// something are only legible because the fourth state is empty.
//
// ── THE PAINTED PAGE THAT WAS TRIED, AND WHAT THE OWNER SAID ABOUT IT ───────
//
// FIDELITY.md item 13 asked the places to bring their own ground — #12121A over
// every cell of home and the six places — on the reasoning that a surface which
// paints its own page no longer has to guess what is under it. It was built, and
// on 2026-08-25 the owner tested it and reversed it in one sentence: "i want bg
// color and text color to be same as in inside chat please this new bg looks
// weird i think we were taking user terminal stuff or something previously."
//
// So THE TERMINAL'S OWN BACKGROUND SHOWS THROUGH EVERYWHERE, and the reason the
// law originally gave for itself turns out to be the reading a person actually
// has: a ground this program authored is a ground laid over somebody's theme,
// and it looks like one. A place raises the cursor and selection steps of THIS
// ladder and paints nothing else. FIDELITY item 13 carries the reversal note.
//
// ── THE EMPHASIS LAW ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A ROW IS EMPHASIZED BY RAISING ITS GROUND AND TURNING ITS LEADING TEXT
// ACCENT. NOTHING ELSE EVER CHANGES.
//
// No new colour arrives for the emphasized state, no run of bolding spreads
// across the row, and above all NO OUTLINE IS ADDED — emphasis is a step UP
// this ladder, never a ring drawn around a thing. The ground says which band
// of pixels is being spoken about; the accent on the leading glyph or word
// says what it is. Two moves, both already in this file, and a lane that finds
// itself reaching for a third has found a state this ladder does not have
// rather than a colour this table is missing.
//
// ── WHY THE STEPS ARE AUTHORED, AND WHEN THEY ARE DERIVED INSTEAD ───────────
//
// THE STEPS BELOW ARE DERIVED WHEN THE TERMINAL ANSWERS AND AUTHORED WHEN IT
// DOES NOT, and both halves exist because the two are answers to two different
// questions rather than a good way and a bad way of doing one thing.
//
// The honest way to build this ladder is the way a compositor builds it: take
// the background, move it away from itself at a stated ratio, and let every step
// inherit the theme's own hue for free. That needs a background, and for four
// waves this file had none. There is no variable that states it, and the one
// query that would — OSC 11 — is a round trip on a terminal that may never
// answer, which is not something a CONSTRUCTOR may wait on (see [detectTheme]
// for the same wall, met from the other side).
//
// What changed is not the wall, it is the door beside it. A background reply is
// an EVENT: [app.Init] asks with tea.RequestBackgroundColor and the answer, if
// there is one, arrives as a tea.BackgroundColorMsg on the same lane as every
// keystroke. Nothing blocks, there is no timer, and there is no deadline to get
// wrong. adaptive.go turns that one colour into this whole ladder —
// [adaptRamp] — and the surface repaints.
//
// So the values below are THE PERMANENT FALLBACK, and they are load-bearing:
// they are what a terminal that stays silent paints, which is every terminal
// that does not implement the query, every pipe, every recording, and every
// frame drawn between startup and the reply. A silent terminal is not a degraded
// one — it gets exactly the surface four waves of authorship aimed at it — and
// that is the whole reason the question can be asked at all.
//
// What is authored is aimed rather than guessed, and the aim is what adaptive.go
// derives AGAINST: it is the same three ratios either way, measured against a
// real ground when there is one and against an assumed range when there is not.
// The assumed ground is the range real dark terminals actually sit in, #101014
// through #1e1e2e, and the aim is the band a wide reading of calm terminal
// palettes converges on: the cursor step at ≈1.1–1.2:1 against that ground, the
// selected step at ≈1.35–1.5:1, and the marked span louder again because it is
// transient and spans many rows at once. Measured, at the middle of the assumed
// range:
//
//	step      dark      #101014  #1a1b26  #1e1e2e   256
//	cursor    #242932    1.30     1.17     1.09     235
//	selected  #2E3440    1.52     1.37     1.31     237
//	mark      #434C5E    2.20     1.98     1.90     239
//
//	step      light     #FFFFFF  #ECEFF4            256
//	cursor    #E5E9F0    1.22     1.06              255
//	selected  #D8DEE9    1.35     1.17              254
//	mark      #B7C0D1    1.83     1.59              251
//
// The cost of authoring is stated rather than hidden, and it is exactly the cost
// a reply pays off: a fixed ground reads one notch louder on a blacker terminal
// and one notch quieter on a lighter one, and on a tinted page like nord's own
// #ECEFF4 the whole light ladder drops close to invisible. That is the price of
// not knowing. It is still cheaper than a query that hangs — which is why the
// query does not hang, and why these values remain what a terminal that will not
// say gets.
//
// Two things survived this retune unchanged and both were deliberate. #2E3440
// is the value this file has drawn under the pointer since the day it first
// drew a background — it moves DOWN one rung to become the selected step, and
// the row a person has been looking at for four waves keeps its exact weight
// while the pointer's own step gets quieter. And the light ladder's first two
// steps are byte-identical to what they were, because they were already inside
// the band; a value in band is not touched.
//
// The last COLUMN of each table is what keeps the ladder honest below
// truecolor: all six steps resolve into the 256 palette's GREY RAMP — 235, 237,
// 239 climbing away from black and 255, 254, 251 descending off the page —
// rather than into its colour cube. A ground that rounded into a hue would be a
// tint that looked like it meant something, and no step on this ladder means
// anything by itself.
var (
	// hueCursor is the cursor step: the row the pointer is over, and the row a
	// keyboard cursor sits on. Nord's own polar night pulled toward the void —

	hueCursor = mustHue("#242932", flat)

// Six hues that mean NOTHING, which was once their design and is now the reason
// nothing on this surface paints with them.
//
// They were spent on one cell: the marker at the head of a task row, hashed off
// the id, so that ◆ teal was task 3 everywhere it appeared. The argument was that
// a person running four tasks needs to know WHICH ONE a row belongs to. What that
// cost was a private alphabet of eight shapes in six colours which had to be
// learned, was relearned every session because ids restart, and put arbitrary
// colour on a surface whose whole colour law is that colour means something —
// while the row already carried the id in a form a person can say out loud and
// the state in its own mark and its own word. So the marker is one shape, dim,
// and the same for every task (taskident.go states the change and why).
//
// THE HUES ARE LEFT HERE RATHER THAN DELETED because the palettes below are
// built as complete ramps and every tier declares one; an empty ring would be a
// hole in three tables to save six lines, and a structural test walks those
// tables field by field to prove the light ladder is derived from the dark one
// (adaptive_test.go). THE DOOR IS GONE, which is the half that mattered:

//
// Everything above this line is the CONVERSATION's palette. Home and the six
// places beside it (pages.go) PAINT FROM IT TOO, and this block is the record of
// why there is no second table any more.
//
// FIDELITY.md item 1 asked for the design's own nine hexes on the places: three
// greys (#E6E6F0 / #A0A6BB / #7C8296), three colours (amber #EECE96, cyan
// #A4D7EA, green #A2E2BC) and three grounds (#12121A / #1D1D28 / #262633). It
// was built exactly, with place-scoped variants of the glare law, the isoluminant

//
//	"i want bg color and text color to be same as in inside chat please this new
//	 bg looks weird i think we were taking user terminal stuff or something
//	 previously"

// authored for the same reading, so the design's own semantics survive without a
// single new colour.

// THE DESIGN'S THREE MEANINGS ARE KEPT AND ONLY THE HEXES ARE THE CHAT'S: amber
// is a person being waited on, the accent is work in flight this instant, and
// green is a figure in dollars. Home already warned in [hueWarn] before the
// fidelity wave, so the amber reading did not move at all — only the two points
// of lightness the design's own token table carried.
//
// ── THE ONE-ACCENT LAW, AS THE DESIGN'S OWN PREAMBLE STATES IT ──────────────
//
// The designer wrote it down and then flagged it as unresolved: "one accent per
// screen vs. two live states. I read the law as one accent per meaning — amber
// for waiting on a person, cyan for in flight, and nothing else in colour."
//
// That reading survives the reversal, because it is arithmetic about how many
// meanings a screen carries rather than a claim about which hexes carry them. So
// a place still RETIRES two of the conversation's roles rather than merely
// re-pointing them ([placeRampFrom]):
//
//   - [hueData]'s cyan — the payload rule's identity ink — becomes the body ink
//     on a place, because a lifted datum on a screen with three meanings lifts by
//     being the SUBJECT tier, which is what SCREEN 2a says every hierarchy step
//     past the fourth must do.
//   - the question hue became the amber, because home used to say "a person is
//     needed" in two colours and the design says it in one. Since 2026-09-11 that
//     is true of the conversation too ([palette.ask]), so this one is no longer a
//     re-point: there is nothing left to retire.
//   - [hueAdd]'s olive — the tick on work that landed — becomes the second voice,
//     because the glyph already says it landed and a hue saying it again spends
//     the screen's colour budget on the least urgent fact on it.
//
// The conversation keeps the other two, untouched: a datum inside a conversation
// and a landed diff are different objects from a row on a list.
//
// The ONE hue that survives outside the design's three is [hueBad]'s orange-red.
// It is a deviation and it is flagged rather than hidden: the design's own token
// table has a Coral for broken, its preamble does not name it, and a failed row
// stripped of every non-glyph signal is a row whose failure is carried by one
// cell of punctuation. It stays until the owner says otherwise.
//
// ── AND THE GROUND IS THE TERMINAL'S, ON A PLACE AS IN A CHAT ───────────────

// The painted page is gone with the inks that were authored against it. THE
// GROUND LADDER above is the only ladder, on every surface: rest is not a colour,
// and a place lifts a row off the terminal's own background only where a person
// put a pointer or a cursor on it ([hueCursor], [hueSelected], [hueMark]).
//
// The NoColor and plain profiles therefore need no special case here at all —
// there is nothing to suppress — and TestEveryPlaceHoldsAtThePlainFloor still
// walks every place with both floors on, because "legible as text with every
// escape removed" is a law about the layout rather than about the ground.

//
// The palette holds a ramp rather than reading the package vars directly, which
