// THE ARROWS ARE THE COLUMN'S, AT EVERY WIDTH.
//
// Home's foot says `↑↓ move · enter open` on every frame it draws, and on a
// narrow one it was a promise nothing kept: the roster reads the keyboard
// ABOVE [app.key] (app.go's Update), and its stand-down list named every
// fullscreen page but this one. A roster held on a frame with no column for it
// is drawn nowhere at all while home is up ([app.frame] returns home's frame
// long before [app.railFull] is asked), so the six keys it takes — ↑ ↓ ← → enter
// esc — went into a list nobody could see, and the only thing left that moved
// the selection was the pointer.
//
// These tests press the keys THROUGH [app.Update], which is the whole point:
// calling [app.homeKey] directly is asking home what it would do with a key it
// never received.
