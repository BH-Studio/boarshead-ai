// cut of this test carried three of them and missed every READ the same agent
// makes over the same socket. What a door IS, exactly, is a method on
// [remote.Agent] that reaches the wire: `a.c.call`, `a.c.callWithin` or
// `a.c.callAnswered`, directly or through another of its own methods. That is
// read out of `internal/remote` itself, so a method added there is on this law
// the day it is written — and a method that turns out to be a local read off
// the welcome or the facts desk (`Usage`, `ContextTokens`, `SteerRepeatKnown`)
// is off it for the only reason that matters: it crosses nothing.

// on this list is EXPECTED to be asked from the loop and is not reported; a door
