// ── WHAT THIS PROJECT DOES WHILE NOBODY IS THERE, ON THE SETTINGS PAGE ──────
//
// A SETTING THAT CHANGES WHAT THE PROGRAM DOES ON ITS OWN IS NEVER REACHABLE
// ONLY BY A SLASH COMMAND (owner ruling 2026-09-11). `/autonomy` has been the
// only door to these rules since they landed, and slash commands are invisible:
// a person who has never been told the word cannot find it, and this is the one
// setting that decides whether their work is answered without them.
//
// So the rules have a row where settings are browsed. It is the SAME reader and
// the SAME writer as the command — [app.autonomySheetText] prints what these
// rows draw, [app.changeAutonomy] writes what these rows write, and the engine's
// own door ([session.Agent.SetAutonomy]) refuses what it always refused — so the
// two can never disagree. What this file adds is a place to stand.
//
//	questions while you are away
//	permission        ask me
//	choice            recommend then go · 30s
//	judgement         ask me
//	clarification     ask me · never runs on a clock
//	confirmation      ask me · destructive always asks
//	landing           decide yourself
//	assumptions       recommend then go · 10m
//	already done      ask me
//
// THE WORDS ARE THE PERSON'S AND THE KIND IS THE ENGINE'S. The value cycles
// through the three answers in a person's words; the row's own name is the word
// `/autonomy` takes, so somebody who wants the command can read it off the page
// they are already looking at.

// The words these rows say, spelled once here and quoted in the manual exactly.
