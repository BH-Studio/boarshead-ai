// Package tui3 is the v3 chat surface in its first, linear form: a try-out
// door onto internal/session and nothing else. One column, one conversation,
// one input line — the person types, the agent works, and what it does streams
// back as it happens.
//
// It is deliberately less than docs/CHAT-V3.md describes. The rooms,
// the cards and the node drill-in all belong to the tasker, and the tasker is
// not attached yet: when it is, it arrives as extra tools inside the session
// and extra panes beside this one. Until then a surface that draws a rail
// would be drawing a lie, so this one draws a conversation.
//
// The seam is [Agent] — the handful of methods this surface calls on a session.
// *session.Agent satisfies it; so does a scripted fake, which is how the
// surface is tested without a provider. The surface never constructs an agent
// (cmd/codeaf owns config resolution and session files); it is handed one, and
// handed a way to ask for a fresh one when the person types /new.
//
// What lives where:
//
//	tui3.go     the package seam: Agent, Options, Run
//	app.go      the program model: state, messages, the event pump, slashes
//	consent.go  the approval question: the overlay, the keys, the annotation
//	thinking.go the reasoning block: streamed, then collapsed to one row
//	followup.go ctrl+enter: the message that waits for the turn to end
//	input.go    the multi-line draft and the key map
//	render.go   the styles and the transcript → lines function
//	view.go     the frame: status line, conversation viewport, input block
//	palette.go  the model picker, and the overlay grammar all three lists share
//	commands.go the command list: what "/" opens
//	files.go    the file completion: what "@" opens
//	taskmention.go the other half of "@": this project's tasks, and the pointer
//	            block a chosen one becomes in the sentence
//	attach.go   the attachment tray: pictures on their way into a message
//	recall.go   the up arrow: input history, and the draft it holds for you
//	draft.go    the unsent sentence, kept per directory between sessions
//	replay.go   a resumed session, drawn
//	resume.go   the session picker: /resume, and what `codeaf resume` opens on
//	models.go   where the model list comes from, and never from the network
//	settings.go the settings panel: tabs over internal/config's own registry
//	welcome.go  the box an empty session opens with, and the sessions in it

	//     conversation on screen.
	//   - THE CONVERSATION BEING LEFT IS NOT CLOSED (welcome.go's

	//     opened. The engine already ends the previous conversation as part of the
	//     swap (internal/remote's Session.swap interrupts and closes it), so there
	//     is nothing left here to close.
	//
	// WHAT IT COSTS A PERSON is that these doors hold ONE conversation at a time:
	// opening another from home, the switcher or Sessions swaps to it and

// heard the signal: [app.quit] did not run, the unsent draft was not written to
// disk, the session was not closed, and the door printed
// "error: program was interrupted" and exited 1. A person who typed `kill -INT`
// at a hung terminal, or whose terminal was not in raw mode so that ^C arrived
// as a signal rather than as a keystroke, lost their draft and got an error for
// a perfectly ordinary way to leave.
//
// SO THE SIGNAL BECOMES A MESSAGE INSTEAD OF A RETURN. sigQuitMsg is routed in
// [app.Update] to the same [app.quit] ctrl+c calls, which writes the
// draft, closes the session and returns tea.Quit — the ordinary exit, with a nil
// error and status 0. Sending InterruptMsg ourselves would have reproduced
// exactly the bug; tea.QuitMsg would exit cleanly but skip [app.quit] and take
// the draft with it. This is the one path of the three that both runs and exits
// zero.
//
// SIGHUP IS ON THE SET TOO. It is what arrives when a terminal window closes or
// an ssh connection drops, and it must reach the same draft-writing, session-
// closing road instead of ending the process underneath every defer.
//
// A SECOND SIGNAL ENDS THE PROCESS AT ONCE. Before that forced exit, this door
// hands the screen back on a bounded best effort; putting a tidy terminal ahead
