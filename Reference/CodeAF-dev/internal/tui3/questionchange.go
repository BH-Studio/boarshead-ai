// `c change` on a receipt: a decision made again.
//
// The receipt above the box has offered `c change` on every reversible decision
// since it was written (question.go's [app.questionReceiptLine]) and nothing has
// ever taken the key — a sentence on the screen naming a key that does nothing.
// What it takes now is the SAME question, put back on the block with its answers
// exactly as they were read the first time, and the answer it takes carries one
// bit saying the decision is being changed ([session.Answer.Revises]).
//
// IT IS NOT A SECOND ANSWERING PATH. The block draws it, the pointer walks it
// and [app.answerQuestion] sends it, all unchanged; the only difference between
// a question and a question being changed is that bit and the receipt that came
// off the screen to make room for it.
//
// THE KEY IS ONLY TAKEN WHERE THE SENTENCE IS ON THE SCREEN AND THE BOX IS
// EMPTY. A receipt is drawn above the box in the conversation for a short while
// after an answer ([app.questionRecordsShown]); outside that, `c` is a letter
// somebody is typing, and a surface that took it would be answering a question
// with the first word of a sentence.
