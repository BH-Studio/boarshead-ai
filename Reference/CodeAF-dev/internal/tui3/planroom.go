package tui3

// planroom.go is A RUN'S TASK IN THE TASK ROOM.
//
// A task on the run engine is a row of the run's plan store and not a node of
// this window's graph: it has no journal and no live lane, and for a while it
// opened a page of its own that looked like the room and was not one. The owner
// ruled that the two should be the same page, so there is ONE PAGE TYPE and
// this file is its second source. A run's task opens the same [taskRoom], with
// the same head, the same transcript renderer, the same box and the same keys;
// what changes is where the page READS from.
//
//   - The transcript is the worker's trajectory: each step is the conversation's
//     own shell call, with its command and what came back, drawn by the same
//     renderers every call is drawn by ([app.planRoomEntries]).
//   - A person's note on the task is their correction, drawn where a
//     correction is drawn, and what they type into the box becomes one
//     ([app.planRoomSteer], the store's own note verb).
//   - `x` stops it through the plan's door, which for the run's own task is the
//     run's stop ([app.planRoomStopTarget]).
//   - The head reads the store's own figures, and a figure the store has not
//     got is left off rather than drawn as a zero ([app.planRoomNode]).
//
// THE STORE IS READ OFF THE LOOP AND ON A BEAT. A page on work that can still
// move is read again every [elsewhereEvery], the rail's own beat for the same
// store, and a page on work that has ended is read once and never again.
