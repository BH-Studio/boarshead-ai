// A TURN NOBODY ASKED FOR REACHES THE SCREEN.
//
// Work handed to a task lands minutes later, usually with nothing running: the
// session takes the news and starts a turn of its own to say what it makes of it
// ([session.Agent.Wakes]). Nobody is holding that turn's channel, so what these
// tests own is that the surface holds it — and that it draws a turn the person
// did not type without inventing a line saying they did.

// THE LANE THIS SURFACE READS IS THE ONE THE REAL SESSION HANDS OUT. The
// assertion is optional at runtime (followup.go's [wakeAgent] is asserted, not
// required), so this is where a signature drift would otherwise be found by
// nobody: a surface that silently stopped matching would simply never wake.
