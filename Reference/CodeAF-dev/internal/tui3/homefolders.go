// ── WHAT A CONVERSATION IS ABOUT, ON HOME ───────────────────────────────────
//
// A conversation is filed under the project it is STANDING IN — the folder the
// window was opened in, which is what home's buckets are and always were. Since
// the places wave it can also be ABOUT somewhere else: a folder somebody named
// with `/folder` or `/attach`, or one the ground ladder resolved and the
// conversation wrote down (internal/session/places.go). That fact belongs on
// home, because home is where a person goes to find the conversation they had
// about a thing rather than the conversation they had in a directory.
//
// THE WORD HERE IS `folder` AND NEVER `place`. This surface already spends
// "place" on the seven rooms of the tab bar (homeplaces.go, pages.go), and a
// second meaning on the same screen would be one word for two things a person
// can point at. The session layer's own type keeps its name; everything this
// file draws or is called is a folder.
//
// TWO RULES, AND BOTH ARE THE EMPTINESS LAW:
//
//   - THE STANDING FOLDER IS NOT NEWS. The project heading over the row already
//     says where the conversation lives, so the folder it is standing in earns
//     nothing on the row under it.
//   - AND NEITHER IS A FOLDER THAT WOULD REPEAT THE PROJECT'S NAME. `wisp ·
//     also about wisp` is one fact said twice, in the width the name needed.

// are one sentence in two places rather than two spellings of one idea.
const homeAlsoWord = "also about"

// standing in, newest first, exactly as the conversation accrued them.
//
// The standing folder is dropped by path and not by name: it arrives on the row
// twice — as the workspace the conversation was opened in and as the project
// directory home filed it under — and either spelling of it is the place the
// heading has already named.

// of this file. The path is kept in the set [homeFolders] answers, so the card
// still names a genuinely different folder that happens to share a basename;
// what is refused is only saying one word twice on one row.
