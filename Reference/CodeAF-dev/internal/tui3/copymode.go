// COPY MODE: ctrl+b, and the reason it exists is the alt screen.
//
// This surface runs in the alt screen (view.go), which is what lets the
// conversation scroll under its own anchor — and which takes the terminal's own
// scrollback and selection away in the same breath. A person who wants the
// stack trace that just went past has, without this, exactly two options: drag
// the mouse across it while the surface is also tracking the mouse, or scroll
// up and read it out loud to themselves.
//
// So: ctrl+b freezes the viewport and hands the keyboard to a reader.
//
//	↑ ↓ pgup pgdn   move the cursor through the frozen rows
//	v               drop a mark, or lift it
//	a               take the whole block under the cursor
//	y               yank — the cursor's line, or the marked span
//	esc             leave, and rejoin the live edge
//	COPY            in the status line, for as long as it is up
//
// ── WHY "a" ──
//
// Because the thing a person wants is almost never a range of lines: it is an
// answer, a tool's output, a fenced block of code. Building that out of v and
// nine presses of ↓ is the reader doing arithmetic to say something it already
// knows — every row of the snapshot remembers which block it came from, and a
// fence announces itself by the hairline down its left. So "a" asks for the
// block and the cursor stays where it was, which means a on a code row inside
// an answer takes the code, and a again takes the answer around it.
//
// ── WHAT COMES OUT ──
//
// What a person copies must be what a person could PASTE. That is why the
// snapshot is kept plain as well as painted, and it is why the yank also lifts
// the column the renderer draws down the left of a block — the stem under an
// expanded tool call, the hairline beside a fence. Those cells are the frame
// saying "these rows are one thing"; in a paste buffer they are a box-drawing
// character welded to the front of every line of somebody's stack trace.
//
// ── WHAT "FREEZES" MEANS ──
//
// The rows are SNAPSHOTTED on entry, painted and plain, and the frozen list is
// what the frame draws until esc. The conversation underneath keeps going — a
// turn that was running keeps streaming, tool rows keep landing, the follow-up
// queue keeps draining — and none of it moves the rows being read. That is the
// whole point: a viewport that reflowed under somebody trying to copy line 14
// would hand them line 19.
//
// The snapshot is also why a click does nothing while it is up (app.go): row 14
// of a frozen list is not row 14 of the conversation, and a click that expanded
// "whatever is there now" would open a call the person cannot see.
//
// ── WHY OSC 52 AND NOT A CLIPBOARD LIBRARY ──
//
// Because the terminal may not be on this machine. OSC 52 is a clipboard write
// carried in-band, over the same pipe the drawing goes down, so it works
// through ssh and through a container without a display, and it is the only
// mechanism that does. Inside tmux it needs the passthrough wrapper — tmux
// eats sequences it does not recognize unless they are addressed to it — hence
// [tmuxTerm] and the doubled ESC below.
//
// Bubble Tea has [tea.SetClipboard], which sends the bare form. This file
// builds its own because the bare form is the one that silently does nothing
// inside a multiplexer, which is where a lot of these sessions live.

// ── AND THE OTHER DOOR: ctrl+s ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Copy mode is the keyboard's answer. This is the mouse's, and it exists
// because the surface takes the pointer by default (view.go): while it holds
// it, dragging across an answer scrolls or hovers, and the drag every person
// alive already knows selects nothing.
//
// ctrl+s gives the pointer to the terminal. Drag, copy the way that terminal
// copies, and the next key pressed here takes it back — there is no mode to
// leave and nothing to remember, because the gesture that ends it is the
// gesture that follows it anyway. While it is out, one dim line says so.
//
// It is deliberately NOT the ui.mouse setting under another name. The setting
// is a standing decision about how this surface behaves; this is a person
// reaching for one paragraph, which is a thing they do between two keystrokes
// and should not have to open a panel for.

// selectKey hands the pointer over. ctrl+s survives the trip: the terminal is
// in raw mode while this surface is up, and raw mode is exactly what turns off
// the flow control that would otherwise have eaten it.
const selectKey = "ctrl+s"

// releaseMouse toggles the handover, and reports whether the surface had a
// pointer to hand over at all. With ui.mouse off the terminal already has it,
