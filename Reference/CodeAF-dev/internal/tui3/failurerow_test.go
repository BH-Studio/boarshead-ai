//
// These are the owner's report of 2026-09-10 written down as tests: a turn ran
// two commands, failed the follow-up request four times over ninety seconds and
// gave up — and what was on the screen two minutes later was a step that still
// said `running 2 commands` with nothing under it. "Things are just stuck".
//
// Each of them asserts THE RENDERED FRAME rather than a field, because every one
// of the defects was a fact the surface held perfectly well and never drew.

// failureNotes is every line a surface wrote about itself, in order. It takes the
// entry list rather than the app, because the two surfaces under test here hold
// theirs in different places ([app.entries] and [taskRoom.entries]).
