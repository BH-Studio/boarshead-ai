// THE HARNESS PICKER: /harness with a space after it, and every saved shape of
// work is a row you can type at.
//
// The panel next door (harnesspanel.go) answers "what have I got". This answers
// the other half of the same errand — I KNOW WHICH ONE I WANT, RUN THAT ONE —
// and until it existed there was no way to say it. A harness reached you by
// being detected: you described the work, a matcher scored your sentence, and a
// card asked whether you meant it. That is the right road for somebody who does
// not know the registry has the thing they are describing, and it is a maze for
// somebody who does. Cues are not even saved to disk, so after a restart the
// only sentence that reliably raises the card is one that NAMES the harness.
//
// So: a picker, and the choice sits in a chip while you write the request.
//
//	/harness            the panel, as it always was — browse the cards
//	/harness <query>    the picker: filter, ↑↓, enter, and the name is a chip
//	<the request>       enter runs THAT harness on exactly what you typed
//
// Four decisions, and three of them are borrowed rather than invented:
//
//   - IT IS SYNCED OFF THE DRAFT, not modal like the model picker. The query is
//     the text after "/harness " in the box a person is already typing in — the
//     command list's own arrangement (commands.go), because this is the same
//     gesture continued rather than a second thing that opened over it.
//   - IT IS THE OVERLAY GRAMMAR (palette.go): a short list under the draft, ↑↓,
//     enter, esc, and the scoring is the fuzzy matcher every picker on this
//     surface shares (internal/fuzzy).
//   - THE CHOICE IS A CHIP IN THE TRAY (attach.go), not text in the draft. A
//     harness name written into the sentence would be a word the harness then
//     has to read past — the request is what the run is asked to do, and the
//     name is not part of it. The tray is where this surface already keeps
//     "what the next message carries besides its words".
//   - THE WORDS THAT REACH IT ARE THE /harness ROW'S OWN (commands.go), read off
//     that row rather than listed again here. `/subharness` and `/sub` used to be
//     among them and are not any more: a subharness is now a typed program with
//     an input schema and an intake card (subharness.go), which is a different
//     thing from a saved shape of work, and one word for two things is a word
//     nobody could rely on.

// harnessPickRows is how many LINES the picker takes at most, the ceiling every
// bottom-anchored list on this surface has.
const harnessPickRows = 10

// harnessBrowseWord is the last row, always: the door back to the cards. It is
// a row rather than a hint because the panel is a real answer to "I do not
// recognize any of these names" — and a person who opened this list by typing
// is a person whose hands are on the keys, not on the slash they would have to
// retype.
const harnessBrowseWord = "Browse the registry"

// harnessPickHint is the tray's dim tail beside a chosen harness: what to do
// next, said where the thing that is waiting is drawn.
const harnessPickHint = "— type the request · enter runs it"

// harnessChipCap is how much of a name the chip may spend. It is the strip's
// own cap plus a little, because this chip is alone on its row rather than one
// of six on a shared one (taskstrip.go's [stripTitleCap]).
const harnessChipCap = 24

// The chip's two marks. The glyph is a COG rather than the registry's diamond:
// the diamond means "a thing this session is carrying" wherever it appears
// (styles.go), and what is in the tray is not a thing being carried — it is a
// tool that has been picked up and is about to be used.
