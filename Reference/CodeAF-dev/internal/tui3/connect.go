// CONNECTING AN ACCOUNT.
//
// The agent reaches for something the person has not connected yet — their
// calendar, their mail — and the session stops and asks. That question, the
// browser it opens, and the line that says how it went are this file; the list
// a person opens on purpose is connectpanel.go beside it.
//
// It is drawn in the family the approval question belongs to (consent.go): a
// bottom-anchored block above the draft, answered with one key, queued when
// there is more than one. It is deliberately QUIETER than that question, and the
// difference is what the two are about. An approval question is a call about to
// run against somebody's machine and it takes the loudest colour on this
// surface. This is an offer:
//
//	? Google
//	  codeaf wants to connect your Google account
//	  [enter] connect · [esc] not now
//
// Four decisions, each the reason a row is shaped the way it is:
//
//   - THE SERVICE IS THE HEADING. Not "authorize", not the scopes, not the
//     provider's product name for its own sign-in — the thing a person owns, in
//     the word they own it by. The glyph beside it is the one this surface
//     already spends on a question, so the block reads as a question before it
//     is read at all.
//   - ONE LINE OF PURPOSE, DIM. It says who is asking and what for, and it says
//     it in the sentence a person would use out loud. Every other sentence this
//     block could have carried — the scopes, the redirect, the word "OAuth" — is
//     machinery, and machinery on this row is how a person ends up approving
//     something they did not read.
//   - TWO ANSWERS AND NO THIRD. There is no "always" here on purpose: an account
//     is connected once and stays connected, so a widening answer would widen
//     nothing. Declining is "not now" rather than "no" because it IS not now —
//     nothing is remembered, and the next time the agent needs the account it
//     asks again.
//   - IT QUEUES, oldest first, with what is behind it on screen — for the reason
//     the approval question queues (consent.go): a person who answers one
//     question and gets another must have been told it was coming.
//
// AFTER THE ANSWER THE BLOCK GOES AND THE TRANSCRIPT SPEAKS. What the session
// does next is a browser and a wait, and both of those are things that HAPPENED,
// so they land in the conversation where everything else that happened is
// ([app.connectAuth] below).

// Connections is the door onto the accounts this profile has connected. It is
// an interface for the reason [Agent] is one: the surface is driven in a test
// by a scripted one, and the real engine (internal/connect) is wired at the
// door.
//
// Nil is a surface that cannot manage connections — a headless frame, a test,
// a build whose door has not wired one — and /connect says so rather than
// opening an empty list.
type Connections interface {
	// Services is every service this build knows about, each with whether this
	// profile has it and the account it is held as.
	Services() []connect.Status
	// BeginAuth starts one sign-in, with the one address answer the service may
	// have asked for. It may reach the network, so it is called from a command
	// and never from the model loop.
	BeginAuth(ctx context.Context, id, answer string) (*connect.Flow, error)
	// ConnectKey connects one service from a key the person pasted, and hands
	// back where that service stands afterwards. It is the whole of the flow for
	// a [connect.Service] whose Auth is "key": there is no browser, no waiting
	// listener and nothing to abandon, so the panel calls this where it would
	// have called BeginAuth and settles on what comes back.
	//
	// It reaches the network for the same reason BeginAuth does — the key is
	// verified and the account asked for — so it is called from a command too.
	ConnectKey(ctx context.Context, id string, key string) (connect.Status, error)
	// Disconnect forgets one.

	// The three below are what a connected account may DO, which is the
	// question the settings sheet's Connections tab asks (connectcaps.go). They
	// are on this interface rather than on a second one for the reason the first
	// three are on it at all: a surface holds ONE door onto its accounts, and
	// two doors is two answers to "is this connected".

//   - THE COUNT IS THE ONLY TELEMETRY, and it is there for the paste. A key is
//     forty or two hundred characters, the bullets run off the end of the row
//     long before that, and the count is what tells a person the whole thing
//     arrived. It is dim and it is a number, which is what this surface spends
//     on a fact nobody is reading twice.
//   - AN EMPTY BOX DRAWS THE SENTENCE AND NOT A ROW OF NOTHING. The emptiness
//     law with a hint in its place: the box says what to put in it while there
//     is nothing in it, which is the picker's own bargain (palette.go) and costs
