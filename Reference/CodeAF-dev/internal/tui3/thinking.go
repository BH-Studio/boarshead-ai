// THE THINKING BLOCK.
//
// Some models put their working on the wire (session.EventReasoning). It is
// worth showing — a model that is reasoning about the wrong file is worth
// catching before it edits one — and it is worth showing DIFFERENTLY, because
// it is not the answer:
//
//	⠿ thinking · 148 tok                  ← the header, while it streams
//	  the file is probably under internal/   35% — read already
//	  and the caller in cmd/ passes it       60%
//	  the path it was given, so start there  85% — the newest line
//	⠿ thought for 6s · 148 tok · ctrl+e   ← the moment the first word of the
//	                                         reply (or the first tool call) lands
//
// While the reasoning streams it is the lower tier of everything on screen —
// dim, italic, behind its own marker — and it sits ABOVE the answer in progress
// because that is the order it happened in. The moment the turn says anything
// that is not reasoning, the block COLLAPSES to one row carrying the two facts
// worth keeping at a glance: how long the model spent, and how much it wrote.
// ctrl+e, or a click, opens it again.
//
// ── WHY THREE LINES AND NOT ALL OF THEM ──
//
// The streaming block used to draw its whole text, which grew a wall: a model
// that reasons for thirty seconds pushes the answer it is about to write off
// the bottom of the screen, and a wall of dim italic that scrolls under the
// reader's eye is not readable at any speed. Three lines is the READING
// WINDOW — where the model is now, and the two steps it took to get there —
// and the fade (styles.go's [thoughtFade]) is what says which end is new
// without anybody having to work it out. The whole text is not lost: it is one
// ctrl+e away the moment the block settles.
//
// ── DISPLAY-ONLY, AND WHAT THAT COSTS ──
//
// Reasoning is never journaled (internal/session says why: re-sending a model
// its own working as if it had said it out loud is a different conversation),
// so the collapsed row survives in THIS surface's entries for as long as the
// window is open and is absent from every replay — a resumed session shows the
// answers it gave, not the thinking behind them. That asymmetry is deliberate
// and it is the honest one: the alternative is a surface that invents a record
// the session does not have.

// thoughtWindow caps an expanded block. Two hundred rows is a long think and a
// short scroll; past it the block says how much it is holding back rather than
// turning the transcript into a reasoning log.
const thoughtWindow = 200

// thoughtLive is the streaming window: the last three wrapped lines, and no
// more, however long the model goes on for.
const thoughtLive = 3

// toggleThought opens or closes one block, streaming or settled, and LATCHES
// what was chosen — in whichever list is on screen.
//
// It used to refuse while the block was streaming — "there is nothing to expand
// yet" — and that was wrong twice over. There is something to expand: the whole
// buffer is in [entry.text] and only the last three wrapped lines of it are on
// screen, so the reasoning a person wants to read is precisely the part the
// reveal window is holding back. And the moment they most want it is while it is
// still going, because a model reasoning about the wrong file is worth catching
// before it edits one — which is the argument the block's own header makes for
// existing at all.
//
// A NODE REASONS TOO, so this reads the deck rather than the conversation: a
// page that showed the working but would not open it is a block with its own key
// printed on it and nothing behind the key (render.go's [app.bodyDeck],
// room.go).
