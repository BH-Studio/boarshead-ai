//
// A model's markdown is rendered by internal/tui2/prose, which resolves colour
// from internal/tui2/tokens, and the only reason a reply comes back in THIS
// palette's body white is markdown.go's seam — the ink is stated on the Styler
// prose is handed ([tokens.Styler.WithBodyInk]). That statement is made once,
// against the ladder in force at the time. Deriving a new ladder without
// re-making it would repaint every row on the surface against the measured
// ground and leave the ANSWER on the assumed one: the two-whites defect the
// readability wave removed, walking back in through the door the wave added.
//
// The rungs are switched on rather than skipped. [markdownStyler] detects its
// profile from the process environment, so which branch runs here depends on the
// terminal the suite is run in — and both branches are a real law:
// [tokens.Styler.WithBodyInk] states that ANSI16 and NoColor take NO override at
// all, because the sixteen are the user's own theme and an authored hex has no
