// DRAGGING A FILE IN IS A FILE, NOT A SENTENCE.
//
// A terminal has no idea what an image is. Drop a screenshot on iTerm2, Ghostty
// or Terminal.app and what arrives is a BRACKETED PASTE of the file's path —
// `/var/folders/.../Screenshot 2026-08-21 at 5.21.40 PM.png`, usually with its
// spaces backslashed, sometimes quoted, sometimes as a `file://` URL. cmd+V of a
// file copied in Finder does the same thing.
//
// Until this file existed that text went into the draft as text and the message
// went out through [app.submit]: the model was handed a PATH and never the
// pixels. It could sometimes recover — `view_image` reads a file by path — but
// only by spending a tool call on a second model, and only if it guessed that
// the string was worth opening. A screenshot path with four spaces in it usually
// did not survive the guess at all.
//
// So a paste that is NOTHING BUT PATHS TO REAL FILES is read as attachments:
//
//   - a picture goes on the tray and leaves `[image #1]` in the draft, where
//     /image and the @ completion already put them (attach.go);
//   - an ordinary file goes on the same tray without putting its local path in
//     the sentence, so a hosted send can carry its bytes.
//
// The token is the point. It is what the person sees, edits around and can say
// out loud — "what font is image #1", "compare image #1 with image #2" — and it
// goes to the model inside the message text, in the position the person put it,
// while the pictures ride the same message as content parts in tray order. The
// number in the token, the number on the chip and the picture's place in the
// message are ONE number, kept in agreement by [app.forgetToken] whenever a chip
// comes off.
//
// IT IS ALL OR NOTHING. A paste substitutes only when one complete reading of
// it resolves on this machine; anything else — a sentence that mentions a png,
// a diff, a stack trace — is inserted as the text it plainly is. That is what
// keeps this out of the way of the paste the surface sees a thousand times more
// often. The several readings below are terminal spellings of the same gesture,
// not several ideas of what a file is.

// imageTokenHead is the token's opening, spelled once. It is also the cheap
// reject that decides whether a draft is worth rewriting at all.
