// workLab is one conversation with `tasks` pieces of work behind it, the newest
// first, each with a name and an outcome — which is the shape the work band is
// about. The cursor is left on that conversation.
//
// THE FRAME IS [homeCardMin] WIDE BECAUSE THERE IS NO CARD BELOW IT. Home is one
// flat list at every ordinary width and the row's own note carries the fact the
// card was for (SCREEN 1a); the card exists only where the width is genuinely
// spare (homebridge.go's ladder). A test whose subject is the CARD therefore has
// to be asked at a width where a card is drawn at all, and a hundred and sixty
// cells is where the list has everything it wants AND one still fits.
//
// homeCardWidest, just below, is the other end of the same ladder.
//
// AND THE ≥160 CARD NO LONGER COMPOSES THE REGISTERED `work` BAND. The design's
// five bands spell the card's work rows themselves — `✓ label   $1.63`, with the
// fold naming the tasks place (place_home.go's [app.homeCardWork], FIDELITY.md
// item 8) — so a test whose subject is the BAND asks [workSheet] instead, and a
// test whose subject is the CARD asks this.

// tasks place in the right margin and there is nothing to click open (SCREEN
// 1d), so the one band left folding on that card is `made for you` — which is
// [app.homeCardMade] drawing the registered `deliverables` band whole, fold and
