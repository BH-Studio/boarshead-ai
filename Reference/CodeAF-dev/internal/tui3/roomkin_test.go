// ── THE KIN BLOCK UNDER THE FOCUS HEADER ────────────────────────────────────
//
// A room used to say nothing at all about where its node sat in the family the
// engine had modelled all along, so a person standing inside a piece of a
// recursive task could not tell it was a piece of anything. These are the whole
// of that claim: the two sentences, their words, the emptiness, and the rows
// being budgeted rather than merely drawn.

// roomOn puts a room over a node without a door, the way [taskwords_test] does:
// what is under test is the header, and the journal and the lane are not part of
// it.

// carried and this page had no shape to carry.

// THE `part of:` ROW IS GONE ON PURPOSE (roomcrumbs.go). The parent is a PLACE
