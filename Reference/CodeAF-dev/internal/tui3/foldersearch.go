// FINDING A FOLDER BY TYPING AT IT.
//
// folderpick.go is the component and folderplace.go is the app around it; this
// file is the one question they both hand off — GIVEN WHAT SOMEBODY HAS TYPED,
// WHICH OF THESE DIRECTORIES DID THEY MEAN. It is kept apart from both because
// it is the only part of the picker that is pure arithmetic over strings, and
// because the answer wants to change on evidence about how people type without
// anybody reopening a file that draws.
//
// It is NOT [pathScore]. The `@` completion ranks files under one directory,
// where every candidate shares a prefix and the shorter path is nearly always
// the better guess. This ranks a few hundred directories scattered over a
// disk, where the leaf name is what a person is thinking of, the segments above
// it are how they narrow it, and the thing they typed may simply be misspelled.
// The two lists want opposite tiebreaks, so they get two scorers, and the `@`
// one is left exactly as it stands.
//
// ── THE LADDER ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A match falls into ONE TIER and the tiers are compared before anything else.
// Inside a tier the layer decides, then how often the folder has actually been
// picked, and only then how tight the match was. That order is deliberate: the
// tiers are coarse enough that two candidates in the same one are equally good
// answers to what was typed, and between two equally good answers the folder
// somebody uses every day is the one they meant. A scorer that let a two-cell
// difference in match offset outrank a week of use would reorder the top of the
// list every time a person added a letter.

// swapped pair of letters from the folder in front of them. It is last because

// cannot be one slip from everything, and it is only ever reached when nothing
