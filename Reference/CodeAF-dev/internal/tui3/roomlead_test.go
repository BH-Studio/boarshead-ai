// THE BOX SAYS WHERE THE WORDS GO.
//
// A room used to stop saying anything the moment somebody typed: the box's
// placeholder named the node, and a placeholder is the one thing on a surface
// that disappears exactly when it is being used. Everything else that knew — the
// pinned header, the legend, the status line — was somewhere the eye was not
// while a sentence was being written.
//
// So the composer carries the room itself, as one tinted segment in front of its
// own prompt: the node's state cell and its name, in the hue the roster paints
// the same node's glyph with. These hold that it is there while typing, that it
// is the right colour, that it gives way on a narrow frame, and that there is
// nothing there at all out in the conversation.
