// THE FOLDER BROWSER: /folder, and the ONE component for choosing a directory
// anywhere in this product.
//
// It is the palette gesture again (palette.go) — a filter box in the input
// line's place, a list under it, ↑↓ to move, esc to leave everything exactly as
// it was — with three properties that are the whole design:
//
//   - IT OPENS FROM MEMORY. Nothing here walks the filesystem when the list
//     opens. The rows are laid down in layers that were already known: the
//     directories this conversation has been referred to, every project home
//     knows about, and the repositories under `~` from an index built in the
//     background and refreshed off the interaction path. Ranking a few hundred
//     candidates a person has actually been in beats crawling a disk, and it
//     beats it on the axis that matters — the first frame after `/folder` is a
//     list and never a spinner.
//   - TYPING FILTERS; ANYTHING ELSE BROWSES. Free words narrow the candidates
//     with path-segment, abbreviation and typo-aware folder ranking. Input that
//     LOOKS like a path — `/`, `~/`, `./`, `../` — morphs this same surface
//     into COLUMNS, and so does opening a row of the list: `→`, or a click.
//     THAT IS WHY A SEARCH NEVER HAS TO BE RETYPED — the row a filter found is
//     the place the columns open on.
//   - THE COLUMNS ARE SUCCESSIVE AND THEY ARE FINDER'S. The parent on the left,
//     the directory you are standing in beside it, and THE CHILDREN OF THE ROW
//     UNDER THE CURSOR on the right — so a walk down a tree is a walk to the
//     right, and the next level is on screen before you have asked for it. The
//     path above them is a breadcrumb, and every segment of it is a place you
//     can click back to.
//
// WHAT THE MACHINE KNOWS about the highlighted directory — `repository · main ·
// clean`, `folder · 214 files`, `AGENTS.md` — is the dim tail of the action row
// at the foot, one line, beside the one thing this surface exists to do: ADD
// THIS FOLDER. Navigating and choosing are two different acts and they have two
// different gestures, which is the whole reason that row is drawn.
//
// EVERY DIRECTORY READ IS ASKED FOR AS A COMMAND AND DRAWN FROM A CACHE. A
// keystroke may not wait for a disk any more than it may wait for git
// (homeband_repo.go states that law and this list obeys it): the level the
// cursor moved onto is read off the loop, stamped with the opening that asked
// for it, and an answer that arrives after the picker closed or reopened is
// dropped rather than filed against whatever is under the cursor now.
