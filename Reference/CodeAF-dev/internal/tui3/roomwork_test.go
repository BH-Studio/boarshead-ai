// ── THE ROOM FOLDS THE PAST AND COMPACTS THE PRESENT ──────────────────────
//
// These tests used to hold the opposite law shut — A ROOM FOLDS NOTHING — and
// they were right about the defect they were written for and wrong about the
// page. The defect was that the CONVERSATION's chip, which is one chip per
// turn, ate a page that is one turn: a node's life ends in a report, so the
// instant it stopped running everything it had said and done went behind
// "▸ worked · 10 tool calls · ctrl+e" and the person who walked in to watch the
// work was handed the report and nothing else.
//
// The owner ruled the other way on 2026-09-01 (issue #252, ruling 1): the task
// page folds settled work into phase chips by default and the machinery stays
// one keypress away. The chip is spent per SETTLED PHASE now — the work that
// preceded each paragraph the node wrote — so the machinery collapses, every
// paragraph stays standing, and the live frontier does not fold at all. That
// answers the original complaint without building the page on the premise that
// every call has to be read.
//
// So these tests are rewritten WITH the design: what folds, what may never
// fold, and every door that opens what did.
