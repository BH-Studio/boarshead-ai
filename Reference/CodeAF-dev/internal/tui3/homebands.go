// THE RIGHT COLUMN OF HOME IS A STACK OF BANDS, AND EVERY BAND IS ITS OWN FILE.
//
// home.go's [app.homeDetail] owns the two lines nothing may displace — the
// title and the place — and then asks this registry for the rest. A band says
// what kind of thing it is about (a conversation, a standing item, a project),
// what order it sits at, and how to draw itself for a given width; the registry
// composes them top-down with one blank row between, and a frame too short for
// all of them drops whole bands from the bottom ([homeBands]), so the most
// decision-relevant band is the one nearest the title.
//
// ── THE LAWS ──
//
//   - A BAND DRAWS NOTHING RATHER THAN A PLACEHOLDER. The emptiness law: a
//     conversation that ran no tasks has no work band, one that spent nothing
//     has no spend line. An empty slice is the whole answer and costs no row.
//
//   - A BAND IS AT MOST A FEW ROWS, AND A LIST-SHAPED BAND FOLDS. Nothing on
//     this column may grow with the data. A band with more rows than its
//     allowance draws the allowance and one fold line — `▸ …N more <what>` —
//     through [bandFold], which keeps the fold state by band and by subject so
//     the fold a person opened stays open while the cursor is on that row.
//
//   - A BAND'S ORDER IS A KEY, NOT A POSITION. The keys below are spaced so a
//     band can be added between two others without renumbering, and they are
//     the one place the column's reading order is decided.
//
//   - A BAND NEVER BLOCKS. It is drawn on every frame the cursor rests on a
//     row. Anything that reads a file or runs a command caches on the app by
//     subject id (see [app.leftOffBand]'s use of [homeView.last] for the shape)
//     and answers from the cache.
//
//   - A BAND IS REGISTERED FROM ITS OWN FILE'S init, so two lanes adding two
//     bands never edit one line. The registry sorts by order once, lazily.
