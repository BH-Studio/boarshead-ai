//
// The third of the three surfaces (DESIGN.md section 8.4, ruling c-b): the
// strip is what is open in this window, the wall is the same open set drawn
// big, and this page is the team as a team. Every member is on it whether this
// window has it open or not, with what it is doing and when it last moved; the
// packets waiting on the person are cards on it; and the selected team's
// manager is not summarised here, it IS here, as the real conversation
// (teamspagehost.go), so a person can run most of their work from this one
// page and step away.
