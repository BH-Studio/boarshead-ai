// ── why a task stopped where it did ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every node that did not finish used to wear ONE sentence on the rail —
// "stopped — branch kept" — and its comment said that the commonest way to earn
// it was a person pressing stop. Then six such rows were read against their
// records: three were the connection to the model dropping, two were a worker
// giving up going in circles (one of them because another task held the files
// it kept trying to write), one was a check refusing the work, and not one was a
// person. The sentence was true of none of them, and "nothing went wrong" was
// the wrong thing to tell somebody about five.
//
// The engine now says why (session's TaskNotice.Ending), and this file is the
// three kinds of news it draws them as. A PERSON STOPPED IT: the ⊘ and the old
// sentence, because nothing is wrong. IT WAS HALTED — the wire, a threshold, a
// loop, another task's copy, a worker that would not write down what it was
// doing: nothing is known to be wrong and the work can go on from its branch, so
// it wears the ! that asks for a steer rather than the cross that reports a
// fault. IT WAS REFUSED: the run is incomplete, with the report saying what the
// check still needs. IT BROKE: the cross, and the report says what went wrong.

// The words under a row for each ending, in a person's vocabulary and never
// the engine's ("wire", "circling", "refused" are field values, not sentences).
