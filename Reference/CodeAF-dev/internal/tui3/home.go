// HOME: /home — everything this machine has worked on, in one place.
//
// Every other surface here is a reading of ONE conversation in ONE directory.
// That is the whole of what a person is fighting when they say "do I need
// another terminal?": codeaf made the folder you are standing in the identity
// of the screen, so moving between projects meant moving windows, and there was
// nowhere at all that showed the work as a person holds it — everything, at
// once, ordered by what wants them.
//
// This is that place, and it is a GLANCE YOU TAKE rather than somewhere you
// live. It does nothing on its own: no notifications, no charts, no telemetry.
// You open it, you see where things stand, and you leave — into a conversation,
// into a new one, or back into the one you came from with esc.
//
// Three jobs and no fourth:
//
//   - TRIAGE. The left column is every project as a dim heading with its
//     conversations under it, ordered by what is happening rather than by what
//     is newest ([session.World] does that ordering). A conversation stopped on
//     a question wears `▲` and sits at the top of its project, which is the
//     single most valuable row this screen can draw — it is the one thing that
//     costs a keystroke to unblock and can otherwise sit unnoticed for a day.
//     Quiet rows past the first few collapse to one dim line, because density
//     here is omission and never compression.
//   - RECALL. `@` turns the same column into a search over every conversation
//     on the machine, ranked by [homeRank] — a weighted composite over the
//     same word-matching idea the model picker and the resume picker rank
//     with, so three characters find a chat from last week the way they find
//     a model.
//   - THE DOOR. Typing anything else is the start of a new conversation: the
//     words go in the box at the foot, and enter opens a fresh session in this
//     project and sends them. No picker, no ceremony, no structure declared
//     before there is anything to declare it about.
//
// AND IT IS THE SWITCHER. `enter` on any row on this screen opens it, whichever
// project it belongs to, and the conversation you were in stays OPEN behind it —
// still streaming its turn, still running its tasks, one keystroke away.
//
// It used to refuse, with a dim `elsewhere` on every project but this window's
// own, and the reasoning behind that refusal was right: the approval gate, the
// crew, the spend rail and the saved shapes of work are all resolved from a
// workspace at launch, and carrying a conversation across without carrying them
// would be a window quietly running under another project's permissions. What
// changed is the conclusion. A conversation never moves between projects here
// either — a second project means a SECOND CONVERSATION, built the way the first
// one was, on its own workspace, with its own gate (keeper.go). Nothing is
// carried across, because nothing crosses.

// homeShown is how many conversations a project draws before the rest collapse
// into one line. Four is what the reference layout holds under a heading and it
// is roughly what a person scans without reading: past it a section stops being
// a shape on the page and becomes a list.
//
// IT IS A FLOOR AND NOT A CEILING. Every row with work running or work left
// unfinished is drawn whatever the count says — those are the rows this screen
// exists for — and the collapse takes only the quiet ones underneath them.
const homeShown = 4

// homeOpenProjects is how many projects home draws OPEN — heading, rows, item
// band, quiet fold — before the rest collapse to one line each.
//
// THREE, AND THE FIRST OF THEM IS ALWAYS THIS WINDOW'S OWN. The screen was an
// unorganised wall: every project on the machine got a heading and four rows,
// most of them saying `elsewhere`, and a person looking for the one thing that
// wanted them had to read past six projects they had not touched in a week. So
// home now opens the project you are standing in and the two you spoke in most
// recently, and folds everything else into the `elsewhere` block below them —
// which is exactly the shape of the question this screen answers: here is what
// you are doing, and here is everything else, one line each, still reachable.
//
// A FOLDED PROJECT IS NEVER A HIDDEN ONE. Its line says how many conversations
// it holds and how long since anybody spoke in it, it surfaces anything that
// needs somebody or is running, and enter opens it in place. And a search sees
// through the whole arrangement: with anything typed there are no tiers at all
// (see [homeView.buildWorld]).

// enough that the walk is free and fast enough that a task landing in another

// frames a second because something on screen is moving (app.go's [app.paint]),
// and home is a still page — running it at that rate to re-read a directory
// twice a minute would be this surface spending a core on a screen whose whole
// character is that it does nothing. So one tick, three seconds apart, re-armed
// only while home is open. There is no watcher either: the read is a directory
// walk and a lock asked as a question (session's world.go).

//
// THE TRIANGLE IS THE ONLY ONE THAT POINTS AT ANYTHING. The other three are
// round and read as weather; a conversation stopped on a question is the one
// row on this screen that is asking for a hand, and it gets the one shape that
// looks like it is asking.
//
// A ROW WITH WORK RUNNING SPINS. On an animating frame the ● gives way to the
// braille spinner the rail already turns for the same fact ([app.taskStateMark],
// task.go), because "something is happening this instant" is that vocabulary's
// one promise — and home KNOWS it through the same presence file the counts are
// read from, believed for the same fifteen seconds. The ● stays as the still
// tier: the linear tier does not animate, and the rail's away rows keep it too.
//
// AND A ROW AT REST THAT LANDED WORK SINCE YOU LAST LOOKED WEARS THE TICK — the
// rail's own ✓ ([glyphDone]) — instead of the empty circle, which is the whole
// of home's "while you were away": no notification, no banner, one cell of one
// row saying something finished here (see [homeView.seen]).
//
// ── THE TWO MARKS THE DESIGN RE-SPELLED (owner-signed, FIDELITY.md item 4) ───
//
// `?` AND NOT `▲` FOR A ROW THAT HAS STOPPED ON YOU. The triangle was this
// screen's own invention and it was the wrong shape twice over: a warning
// triangle is what a machine draws when IT has a problem, and this row's problem
// is that it is waiting for an answer. The design reaches for the slot
// internal/tui2/tokens already holds for exactly this — [tokens.GlyphNeedsHuman],
// whose own comment reads `"?" // always amber (5.16)` — so the mark, the hue and
// the meaning were already agreed everywhere except here. It is `?` on every
// place now, in the amber (styles.go's [hueWarn]), and SCREEN 2b, 2f, 3b and
// 3c all draw it that way.
//
// `◐` AND NOT `●` FOR A ROW WITH WORK RUNNING. The filled circle said "there is
// something here", which is true of every row on the list; the half-filled one
// says "this is part way through", which is the fact. It is
// [tokens.GlyphWorking], and the design draws it on every moving row of every
// screen it drew.
//
// AND THE ONE SPINNER SURVIVES BOTH. homespinner.go's law is that EXACTLY ONE
// ROW ANIMATES however many are moving, and it animates in braille
// ([app.homeSpinGlyph]) rather than in this alphabet. So `◐` is the RESTING mark
// — what every other moving row wears, and what the animating row goes back to
// the moment it stops being the newest — and the braille cell is still the only
// thing on this screen that moves. Two marks for one state is not a second
// vocabulary: it is the difference between "this is running" and "this is what
// the machine is doing at this instant", which is the distinction the one-spinner
// law exists to draw.
// AND `✕` FOR A CONVERSATION LEFT MID-WAY, which is the one mark this block
// changed when the surface moved onto the shared vocabulary. It used to be `◌`,
// a shape that existed nowhere else and that a person had to be taught; work
// that did not finish is `✕` on the card, on the rail, on the roster and on the
// task page, dim rather than loud unless something actually broke, and this
// screen says the same thing with the same cell.

// homeDraftFloor is how many rows the composer occupies WHATEVER IS IN IT,

//
// A ONE-ROW BOX READS AS A RULE, NOT AS A PLACE TO TYPE. The box grew to fit
// its draft and no further, so the commonest state — a question a sentence
// long — drew a single line between the list above it and the hint below it,
// and a person looking at the screen could not tell the thing they were typing
// into from the two dim rules around it. The complaint was that it is
// invisible, and the cause is that one row of text bounded by two rows of
// chrome has no mass of its own.
//
// SO THE BOX HAS A FLOOR, AND THE FLOOR IS ITS CEILING. Both are three, which
// makes the typing area a block of ONE HEIGHT: it does not grow under the hand
// as a sentence wraps, and the list above it does not step down a row when it
// does. A box that changed height while somebody typed into it was the other
// half of the same complaint, and the two are fixed by one number rather than
// by two that have to be kept apart.
//
// The rows are padded BELOW the draft, never above it, so the first line a
// person types stays on the first row and the caret arithmetic is untouched —
// it derives the caret's row by subtracting this block's height from the rows
// placed, and a pad at the bottom moves both by the same amount. Past three
// rows the window still scrolls under the caret ([draftBlock]), so a paste
// cannot push the list off the screen.
//
// AT REST IT IS THREE ROWS TOO, and that is the point rather than a side
// effect: the one thing on this screen a person types into should be a block
// they can see BEFORE they have typed anything, and a box that jumped from one
// row to three on the first keystroke shifted the list up under the hand
// reaching for it. The resting rows are the box's silhouette and not its
// surface — the press span stays empty, so a click on them falls through to the
// place underneath exactly as a click on the resting row always has, and the
// emptiness law is untouched because the row still says nothing it does not
// know.
//
// AND IT IS THE CHAT'S FLOOR AS WELL AS EVERY PLACE'S. The conversation's foot
// and a place's foot are the same rows — a blank, the rule, the box, the last
// line — and `esc` between them may not move any of them
// (TestWalkingBetweenAChatAndThePlacesMovesNothingAtTheFoot, which is a defect
// that was found and fixed once already). A floor that held on home alone would
// put it straight back, so [boxFloor] is asked by the chat's [app.inputBlock]

// ── the landing ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// landHome decides, once, whether home is the FIRST THING a launch shows.
//
// A person opening codeaf is not usually opening a conversation — they are
// opening the machine, and the conversation is a guess the door made for them
// out of which directory they happened to be standing in. So the first frame is
// this screen, with the conversation the door picked loaded and waiting
// underneath it: esc, or the first character of a message, drops straight into
// it exactly as if home had never been there. Nothing about which session opens
// is changed by any of this — the door had already chosen before the surface
// existed.
//
// THREE THINGS HAVE TO BE TRUE, and each of them is a way of saying that a
// person is being greeted rather than obeyed:
//
//  1. THE DOOR ASKED FOR IT ([Options.Landing]). A `--once` run, a headless
//     frame, a test, anything over `--host` — none of them set it, so none of
//     them can be greeted by accident. And a launch that NAMED a conversation
//     (`--session <path>`, `codeaf resume`) does not set it either: somebody who
//     said which one means that one.
//
//  2. NOTHING ELSE IS ALREADY GREETING THEM. `codeaf resume` opens on its
//     picker; a surface that put a second full-screen greeting behind the first
//     would be two answers to one keystroke.
//
//  3. THERE IS SOMEWHERE ELSE TO GO. A machine whose only conversation is the
//     one this launch just opened has nothing to GREET anybody with — it would
//     be a dashboard of one row, and the row is the screen behind it — so a
//     first run goes straight to the chat and gets the welcome box it always
//     got. Home arrives as a greeting the day it has an answer.
//
//     BEING GREETED BY HOME AND BEING ABLE TO GO THERE ARE TWO QUESTIONS, and
//     this condition answers only the first. The door from inside the
//     conversation — `space space`, `/home`, the advertisement at the foot — is
//     open on every machine home can read at all ([app.homeDoorOpen]), and an
//     empty home is a designed screen rather than a refusal ([homeEmptyRow]).
//     What this condition decides is whether that screen is put in front of a
//     person who did not ask for it.
//
// It is not a setting. Whether a person is greeted is a property of what the
// machine holds and of how they launched, and both of those change by
// themselves; a switch would be a third answer that has to be kept in step with

// ── A DASHBOARD AT REST, A DROP-UP WHILE TYPING ─────────────────────────────
//
// THESE ARE TWO SHAPES ON PURPOSE, and the wave that made them one had to be
// taken back out. What it did was anchor the list at the foot in both states so
// the cursor never moved between them — and what that cost was the screen
// itself: a machine with a handful of conversations drew most of a frame of
// nothing with a clump of rows against the box, and the preview card beside it
// went blank the moment the cursor's row was not a conversation. Home IS the
// dashboard. The drop-up is what typing needs, and it is worth exactly one
// keystroke of re-anchoring and not one row of the dashboard.
//
// AT REST home hangs from the TOP of its region:
//
//   - Projects in the world's own order — most recently spoken in first
//     ([session.Project.At]) — each a heading with its conversations under it,
//     and inside a project what wants you first ([session.sortSessions]).
//   - The cursor opens on the conversation THIS WINDOW IS IN, and the preview
//     card on the right follows it.
//   - Nothing is lifted, so the frame reads top-down as a page of everything
//     this machine holds, which is the one thing this surface is for.
//
// WHILE SOMETHING IS TYPED it becomes a drop-up: the action row is appended as
// the list's last line, [homeLift] pushes the whole column down so that row
// lands against the box, and the matches rise above it ([homeAction] carries
// the defect that bought that). Clearing the box puts the dashboard back.
//
// AND IN THAT SHAPE THE RANKING IS DRAWN UPSIDE-DOWN, which is the one thing
// about the drop-up that is not simply the dashboard moved. A ranked list read
// downward puts its best answer first; a ranked list read UPWARD out of a box
// has to put its best answer LAST, or the row somebody wants is the furthest one
// from the key they reach for. It was the other way round and it cost real
// keystrokes: with three matches on screen, one ↑ landed on the WORST of them and
// the best took three. So the sections and the rows inside them are both turned
// over ([homeRank] is untouched — the scoring is right, only the drawing was
// backwards), and the law is:
//
//	THE FIRST MATCH THE WALK REACHES IS THE TOP-RANKED ONE.
//
// It is the SECOND ↑ and not the first, because `ask here` sits between the
// action row and the matches (homeexchange.go): the two rows that do something
// with the SENTENCE are one cluster against the box, and the rows that are other
// conversations begin above them. Further ↑ walks into progressively weaker ones
// and ↓ comes back toward the box, which is the same grammar the action row
// already had. A project's heading still sits ABOVE its own rows: sections stack
// by rank and the rows inside one do too, but a name drawn under the things it
// names reads upside-down.
//
// AND THE CONVERSATION THIS WINDOW IS IN MAY NOT BE ON THE LIST AT ALL. A
// session folder nobody has spoken in yet is not a row the world reports
// (session's readSessionRow drops one whose meta names it but records no
// message), and a launch that home GREETS is exactly that folder — so
// [homeView.point] finds nothing to point at and the cursor stays where
// [homeView.clamp] left it, on the first conversation of the first project.
// That is the honest place for it, and the thing that matters is that it is a
// CONVERSATION: the card beside it is drawn from the row under the cursor and
// draws nothing for a heading, a fold line or the action row, so a cursor
// resting anywhere but a conversation is a resting home with half its screen
// empty. That is precisely what shipped, and
// [TestAFreshLaunchStillRestsOnAConversationWithItsCard] is the pin that keeps
// it from shipping twice.

// ── the door from inside a conversation ─────────────────────────────────────

// homeDoorWord is the dim advertisement at the foot of an idle conversation,
// and it is written in the hint slot's own grammar — the key, then the noun,
// exactly as `ctrl+g tasks` is (render.go's [app.hintWord]).
const homeDoorWord = "space space home"

// homeGesture is TWO SPACES TYPED INTO AN EMPTY BOX, and it is the way back to
// home — from inside a conversation, and from every place standing over it.
//
// WHY A GESTURE AND NOT A KEY. Every ctrl+letter is taken. `esc` was the
// obvious candidate and is not available: on an idle conversation it already
// arms rewind (the hint slot says `esc again to rewind`) and it already drops a
// message parked against a turn that has ended, and a third meaning on one key
// in that state is how a surface becomes unpredictable. What was left is a
// gesture, and a leading run of spaces in an empty message is the one keystroke
// on this surface that is reliably NOTHING: a message that begins with two
// spaces is a message nobody meant to send that way.
//
// THE INTERMEDIATE SPACE IS REAL, AND THAT IS THE POINT. The first space types
// itself, plainly, the way every other character does — there is no pending
// state, no timer, and no ghost. The SECOND one, arriving to find a box that
// still SHOWS nothing with that space behind the caret, takes the whole draft
// away and opens home. So somebody who genuinely wanted a leading space types it
// and carries on: space then `x` leaves ` x`, untouched, because the gesture only
// ever fires on a space and only ever over a box with no words in it.
//
// WHEREVER THE DOOR IS ADVERTISED, TWO SPACES OPEN IT — and the two halves used
// to disagree, which is the bug this asks [editor.empty] rather than counting
// runes. The foot draws `space space home` whenever the box holds nothing a
// person would call text ([app.homeDoorShowing]), and the gesture demanded a box
// holding EXACTLY one space. Every draft the two disagreed about was a door
// drawn over a gesture that could not fire — and one of them is easy to land in
// and impossible to see: `ctrl+enter` and `shift+enter` (standmark.go,
// bargein.go) arrive as a bare `ctrl+j` on every terminal that cannot spell
// them, and `ctrl+j` opens a line (input.go). Two of those on an empty box left
// `\n\n` in it, the frame drew an empty box over an advertised door, and the
// chord was dead in that conversation for good — [writeDraft] kept the invisible
// draft and the next window on the directory adopted it (draft.go).
//
// THE CARET IS WHAT "THE SPACE YOU JUST TYPED" MEANS, rather than the end of the
// draft: a space typed at the FRONT of a box holding a blank line is the same
// two keystrokes against the same blank-looking box as one typed after it.
//
// PASTED TEXT CANNOT FIRE IT. A bracketed paste arrives as its own message and
// never reaches this router at all, and a paste whose brackets leak is absorbed
// key by key into the bracket's buffer above it (app.go's [app.pasteKey]) —
// so two spaces at the start of pasted text are two characters, not a door. The
// one hole is a terminal that does not speak bracketed paste at all, where a
// paste IS a stream of keystrokes and there is nothing anywhere in this program
// that can tell it from typing.
//
// A RUNNING TURN IS NO OBSTACLE. Home takes the frame the way the settings
// panel does, and the settings panel does not disturb a turn: the stream events
// are their own messages and land whatever is drawn over them (app.go's
// Update). The turn goes on underneath and is still there when esc comes back.
