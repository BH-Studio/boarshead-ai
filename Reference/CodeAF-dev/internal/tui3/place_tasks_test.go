// ── THE TASKS PLACE'S FOOT, AND THE ONE VERB BEHIND IT ──────────────────────
//
// SCREEN 1e draws one line under this place:
//
//	enter open its room · → verbs: run it again, stop it · type to filter · tab next place
//
// These pin it word for word, and they pin the harder half of the same law:
// NOTHING IS NAMED THAT IS NOT BOUND. One of the design's two verbs has a seam
// and one does not, so one is on the strip and in the sentence and the other is
// on neither.
//
// AND THE THIRD CLAUSE MOVED INTO THE BOX. `type to filter` was on this line to
// correct the composer two rows below it, which said `say what you want done`
// over a slot that can only ever filter; the composer says the true sentence
// itself now (place_tasks.go's [placeTasks.resting]), and a foot repeating it
// would be one frame naming one thing twice. So what these pin is the foot
// WITHOUT it, and that the box carries it instead.

// tasksFootApp is the tasks place over a session that can END work: one node
// running, and the door [stopAgent] asserts behind it.
