// ── A DOOR WHOSE CONVERSATIONS SHARE ONE HANDLE ─────────────────────────────
//
// The engine doors — `--host`, `--at`, and the socket an ordinary `codeaf chat`
// opens onto this machine's own engine — all answer [Options.Resume] with the
// AGENT THEY WERE GIVEN, because that agent holds no state: it is a handle on
// whichever conversation the engine currently has open, and the engine has just
// swapped which one that is (cmd/codeaf's chatv3_host.go, internal/remote's
// Agent, and chatv3_host_shared_test.go proves both against the real server).
//
// This file is the SURFACE's half of that contract. The fake below is faithful
// to the wire in the one way that matters: opening a conversation mutates what
// the single handle names and what it is called, and the far end ends the
// conversation it replaced.

// sharedEngine is the far side of a connection with ONE open conversation.

	// where a conversation being left actually goes (internal/remote's

	ended []string
	// stopped and shut are what the SURFACE asked of the handle, each recorded
	// with the conversation that was open at the moment of asking — which is the
	// whole point: a close made after a swap is a close of the WRONG session,
	// and only the pairing shows it.
