// The top row says WHERE YOU ARE, and until this wave it said half of it: `main
// ▸ <this page>`, whatever the work was actually a piece of. These hold the four
// claims the file makes (roomcrumbs.go) — the chain is the real one, a crumb is
// a door exactly where a door exists, the two ends survive the narrowest frame,
// and the fold opens what it hid — plus the two things that can quietly stop
// being true about any hit map: that the columns recorded are the columns drawn,
// and that nothing on this row reaches past the ✕ riding its end.
