// THE THIRD SETTLED STATE, ON THE SURFACE.
//
// session lands a node here when the run is finished, nothing came back that
// could call the work right or call it wrong, the branch is kept, and the
// dependents wait on a person (internal/session's task_contract.go). Every
// assertion here is about the one thing that makes the state worth having — that
// a person can tell it apart from both of the other two at a glance.
//
// AND EVERY WORD OF IT IS A PERSON'S. The engine's own report arrives already
// worded for the reader, and the surface's three words for the state say what is
// true of it from the outside: it finished, and it is on you to look. What made
// it land here is not on screen anywhere, which is the law and not an omission.

// unverifiedNotice is the update session sends for one, report and all.
