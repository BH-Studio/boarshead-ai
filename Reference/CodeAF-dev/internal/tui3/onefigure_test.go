// FOUR SURFACES, ONE FIGURE (issue #269).
//
// One instant on the 2026-09-01 chat run showed four numbers for the same
// money: the status line and Settings→Spending's `this one` said $0.24, the
// machine ledger said $0.157, and Settings→`today` and the `/spend` place said
// $0.16. Two causes met there — the engine wrote the ledger only when a turn
// SEALED, so an interrupted turn's calls reached no file (internal/session's
// usage_percall_test.go pins that half), and this surface read the `this one`
// receipt off the conversation's own books while the row above it read the
// conversation's whole tree.
//
// This is the surface half: one fixture, one interrupted turn's worth of ledger
// rows, and the four places a person can read the figure must render the same
// string.
