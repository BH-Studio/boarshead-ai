// IT REPLACED A PAGE OF FOLDING SECTIONS, and the reason is the thing a person
// does on this page: WEIGH one answer against the next. The old page stacked
// every open answer's paragraph, asides, diagrams and notes one under another
// in a single column, so the second answer's evidence was below the first's
// and comparing them meant scrolling between two places that could not both be
// on screen. With the list fixed on the left and the evidence following the
// pointer on the right, `↓` IS the comparison: the pane changes under the eye
// and nothing else moves.
//
// NARROWER THAN TWO PANES ([besideFits]) IT IS ONE COLUMN, the panel's own
// preview-narrow shape: every answer a row, and the one the pointer is on
// unfolded under its row. The compare table (`x`) and an answer that is a SHAPE
// — holes, a checklist, a run of pairs, a dial — take the column at any width:
// the table lays every answer against every other and needs the whole of it,
// and a shape has no evidence per row to put beside it.
//
// ── TWO WINDOWS, AND THE POINTER IS ALWAYS IN ONE OF THEM ──
//
// The head is pinned; under the rule, the list (or the one column) and the
// evidence pane each keep an offset of their own. The list's window follows the
// pointer ([app.questionRoomShowFocus]) — the answer a person walked to is on
// screen, always — and the evidence pane starts at its top every time the
// pointer moves, because what it shows has just changed. `→` hands the arrows to
// the pane so a long diagram can be read to its end, `←` hands them back, and the
// wheel scrolls whichever pane it is over.

// questionPageOtherWord is what the evidence pane says while the pointer is on
// `something else…`: the page's box is the message box below it, so the row is
// not a box of its own the way the panel's is ([app.questionPanelOther]), and the
// pane says where the words go.
