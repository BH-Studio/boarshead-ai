// It is the one place a person changes WHAT IS ALLOWED — which seat is pinned
// to which model, which models a seat may be picked from, and what the crews
// may spend in a day — and those three are the whole of what persists about a
// crew (crew.go's header, internal/config's crew.go). How hard to try ONE task
// is said in the ask and never here.
//
// SIX ROWS, ONE VERB. Three seats, the allowed models, the providers and the
// cap are the only rows the cursor stops on, and enter is what every one of
// them answers:
//
//   - A SEAT opens the one list this panel has — the models a seat could sit,
//     `auto` first, the router's own suggestion marked — and enter on a row of
//     it pins that seat. Unpinning is choosing `auto`, which is the first row
//     the list opens on, so it is two presses and there is no second verb for it.
//   - THE MODELS ROW IS EDITED WHERE IT STANDS. ←/→ walk its four answers — all,
//     open, a price ceiling, custom — and each step is written as it is taken; a
//     price turns the row into its two ceilings, typed into holes on the row
//     itself; custom opens the checklist, the one other screen here.
//   - THE PROVIDERS ROW IS TOGGLED WHERE IT STANDS. It is one chip per
//     connected provider, ←/→ walk them, and space turns the one under the
//     cursor off or on; the `+` at its end is /connect. Enter opens the one
//     screen that says more about each — how it bills, how many models it
//     serves, what it carried today.
//   - THE CAP IS TYPED WHERE IT STANDS. A digit on the row starts it, enter
//     keeps it, an emptied hole is no cap. There is no dialog to open first.
//
// EVERY CHANGE IS WRITTEN THE MOMENT IT IS MADE, through the same writers the
// `/crew` shortcuts use (internal/config's SetCrewPin, SetCrewAllowedRule,
// SetCrewProviderOn, SetCrewCap), so a refusal is the same refusal whichever door asked. What
// makes that safe is the undo beside it: the row that changed wears a tick,
// and for a few seconds the bottom edge offers `z undo`, which puts the rows
// back exactly as they were ([config.RestoreCrewState]).
//
// A PROVIDER TURNED OFF IS A ROUTE TAKEN AWAY, NOT A MODEL. The allowed models
// are the models row's rule less every model no provider that is still on
// serves, and the models row counts exactly that; the set of providers turned
// off is a row of its own beside the rule (internal/crewroute's providers.go
// argues why it is never a `-x` inside it). Connecting a provider is still
// what adds one — the row only ever lists connections — so a provider
// connected tomorrow is on the day it is connected, and the last one on
// cannot be turned off, because a crew with nothing to route through is no
// crew at all.
//
// ── WHAT IT IS BUILT FROM ──
//
// Nothing here is a widget of its own. The block is THE ONE FRAME (frame.go),
// the frame every object that hangs over the box is drawn in; its rows are the
// overlay row's lead and ground (palette.go's [overlayLead], [palette.cursor]);
// its two lists walk with [moveCursor] and [listTop] and filter with the
// matcher every picker shares ([fuzzyTerms], internal/fuzzy); its filter box is
// the one-line box in the input line's place, exactly where /model and /connect
// put theirs (input.go); and its holes are the question form's own
// `[ value ]` (questioninput.go's [app.questionHole]).
//
// ── ONE PANEL, EVERY DOOR ──
//
// /crew opens it over the conversation. A place cannot draw an overlay
// (pages.go's [app.closeModals]), so /crew typed on home, and the settings
// sheet's `seats` row, step off the place, open this, and esc steps back onto
// the place they came from — one panel, never an embedded copy that could say
// something different.
