// ── THE SURFACE'S SIDE OF LANES ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A model id is an address; the LANE is the machine behind it. One id is served
// by a dozen endpoints that differ by seven times on the wait before the first
// word and by twelve times on how fast they write, at roughly the same price —
// so which lane answers is often a bigger difference than which model does, and
// until this file the surface showed none of it. internal/lane holds the belief;
// this file is the only place that DRAWS one.
//
// Three laws, and they are the package's own said again where a person can see
// them (internal/lane's lane.go):
//
//   - EVERY NUMBER SHOWN IS THE POSTERIOR. Not the sheet's row, not the last
//     answer: the belief that combined them, aged to this moment. Two surfaces
//     computing their own would drift the first time one was fixed.
//   - UNKNOWN DRAWS NOTHING. A model whose lanes nobody has measured gets no
//     speed on its row and no machines in its fold — only the two answers
//     that name none, `auto` and `openrouter` (palette.go's [picker.unfoldAt]).
//     A blank row is readable; an invented number is a router steering on a
//     measurement nobody took (design-law-v2 §16).
//   - THE WORD "SLOW" IS ONLY SAID WHILE SOMETHING IS BEING DONE ABOUT IT.
//     That is the whole of [app.laneRider]'s middle state.
//
// Nothing here fetches, and nothing here chooses. The ledger read is memory
// only by its own contract, and the chooser is pure — both are safe on a draw
// path, which is where every function below is called from.

// ── WHAT THE LAYER THAT SENT THE ANSWER TELLS US ────────────────────────────

// LaneNews is one answer's lane story, as the layer that sent it knows it.
//
// IT IS THE ONE HOOK THIS PACKAGE OFFERS and it is deliberately small. The
// surface cannot see a stream — that belongs to internal/session and
// internal/provider — so the three things it draws that a belief cannot answer
// arrive here: who served, whether a rescue went out, and who finished.
//
// The fields expected from the response boundary, by name:
//
//	Lane      the lane the request was sent to (a chunk's `provider`)
//	Hedged    Response.Hedged — a second request went out for this answer
//	Alt       the lane that second request went to
//	Winner    Response.Winner — the lane whose answer was actually read
//	Trying    the in-flight event: a hedge is out and nobody has committed yet
//	Reason    why that rescue went out — "slow" or "refused"
//	Failed    the retraction: the machine named in Alt has failed
//
// A caller posts twice for a rescued answer: once with Trying while the hedge
// is in flight, and once at the end with Hedged and Winner. It may post once
// for every other answer. Anything it does not know is left zero, and a zero
// field draws nothing.
//
// AND A RESCUE THAT DIES POSTS AGAIN TO TAKE ITS OWN SENTENCE BACK. `trying
// coreweave…` is a claim about the present tense, and until Failed existed
// nothing withdrew it: a refused arm left the promise on the status line until
// the ten-minute window aged it out (issue #266).

	// [provider.RescueRetired], which is not about a rescue at all but about a
	// person's pin, refused for this model and stood down until they pin again
	// (issue #456). It is CARRIED and never
	// decided here: a surface that formed its own opinion about a refusal would
	// be a second classifier, drifting from the one the routing acted on
	// (internal/provider's refusalobject.go). An empty word reads as slow, which

// what the sparkline draws. Neither is a belief and neither pretends to be —
// the ledger owns believing, and it publishes no history, so the ring lives
// here rather than being re-derived from a posterior that has forgotten it.
//
// THE TWO HALVES ARE KEYED BY DIFFERENT THINGS ON PURPOSE. The latest news is a
// claim about one piece of WORK — this conversation, or this node — so it is
// filed under its subject (phase.go's [newsDeskKeys] and the law above it): a
// desk keyed by model let two nodes on one model id overwrite each other. The
// ring is a claim about one MACHINE serving one model, which is what the
// sparkline is drawn from and what the ledger's own belief is about, so it
// stays keyed by the pair it measures. A subject in that key would split one
// machine's history across every node that ever used it.
//
// AND A RESCUE HAS A SLOT OF ITS OWN BESIDE THE SIGHTING, rather than
// overwriting it. There used to be one entry per subject, so the news that a
// rescue had gone out REPLACED the news of which machine last answered — and
// when that rescue then failed without being refused, the rider had nothing
// left to say and `via` went blank. Nothing put it back: the next sighting is
// posted only when an answer finishes, and an interrupted or errored step never
// finishes one. So the rescue goes in `rescue`, the sighting stays in `latest`,
// and the next sighting clears the rescue, because a finished answer is the end
// of every rescue that was about it.

// laneRider is the served segment when the lane layer has something to say, and

// drawn from the velocity ledger.
//
// THREE STATES AND NO FOURTH:
//
//	via cloudflare · 0.6s · 61 t/s     an ordinary answer, and who wrote it
//	slow · trying coreweave…           a lane is late and a rescue is in flight
//	refused · trying nextbit…          a lane said no and a rescue is in flight
//	coreweave refused                  the rescue itself was refused
//	via coreweave · rescued            it worked, for this answer only
//	coreweave cannot serve this model; routing on auto for this model until you pin again
//	                                   the machine you pinned said no, so the pin is retired
//
// AND THE LAST OF THOSE IS SAID IN THE CONVERSATION TOO, which is where a
// person really reads it. This row is outranked by the phase clock for as long
// as a request is in flight ([app.servedRiderAt]) and holds only the NEWEST
// news about a model, which the answer's own arrival overwrites — so a sentence
// that only ever lived here was a sentence nobody saw in a measured run of
// eight cells. The transport says it as a note as well, once
// (internal/provider's lanepin.go), and that one stays.
//
// THE SURFACE SAYS WHAT THE WIRE SAID. "slow" is a claim about a wait and
// "refused" is a claim about a machine, and for a whole measured run this line
// said the first about the second: a 404 meaning `your request's provider.only
// preference permits only: coreweave` was drawn as `· slow · trying nextbit…`
// (issue #266). Neither word is decided here — both are carried on the news
// from the layer that read the refusal — and the line says slow only while
// something is already being done about it, because a status line that called
// an answer slow and then sat there would be a complaint.
//
// AND A CLAIM THAT HAS STOPPED BEING TRUE IS TAKEN BACK. The fourth state is a
// retraction: the rescue this line promised has itself been refused, so the
// promise goes and what is left is the fact.
//
// AND ALL THREE ARE ABOUT AN ANSWER THAT IS FINISHED, which is why the phase
// clock takes the segment away from them while a request is actually in flight
// (render.go's [app.servedRider]). These read the past tense; that reads the
// present one.
// timed says whether the answer's own figures — the wait before its first word
// and, while a turn runs, how fast it was written — ride after the machine's
// name. The sheet's `served` row wants them (statusdeck.go); THE SEAM DOES NOT.
// On 2026-09-10 the owner read `via relace · 1.3s · 79 t/s` on the seam while
// an answer was being written and took the figure for the live rate, which by

// [app.liveRiderAt]) — one frame, two rates, and the one beside the model was
// the LAST answer's average. Who served is attribution and belongs beside the
// model; how fast is a claim about now and has one place on the frame.
//
// IT IS THE SHEET'S READING, AND THE SHEET KEEPS THE OLD SUPPRESSION: the row
