// THE JOBS SECTION AS A READING.
//
// THE LAW THIS FILE EXISTS FOR: a column section is a function of its facts.
// What is running, what has ended, whether the person opened it, the instant
// this frame is drawn at, the width and the rows it may spend — that is the
// whole input. There is no window behind it, no disk, and no second read of
// the clock. That is the same law placelaws_test.go pins for the place
// readings, and it is what makes the section testable with no model and no
// terminal.
//
// The app-side half (jobsection.go) holds the toggle, routes the keys and
// clicks, and calls this. It does not format a string a person sees.

// The section's own words. They are the vocabulary the rest of the product
// already uses for these facts — a job is running or it ran, and what did not
// fit is earlier — and they are quoted in the tests exactly as they are spelled
// here.

	// and that code is the news.

	// It is its own word because "it failed" and "you stopped it" are different
	// news about a process that is equally not running.
	jobsStoppedWord = "stopped"
	// jobsDoneWord is a clean finish. It is a word of its own — not the
	// duration alone — because a frozen clock and a ticking one are the same
	// shape at a glance, and a column of eleven sleeps needs a state a person
	// can read without watching the digits move. How long it ran lives on the
	// page ([jobPageEnding]).
	jobsDoneWord = "done"

// there is exactly one duration to name, and history as a count. History is

// EXPANDED, RUNNING WORK IS NEVER DROPPED. Every live job draws, oldest first,
// and finished jobs then fill whatever room is left, newest first. What does
// not fit is counted on a `▸ N earlier` line rather than silently dropped.
