// HOME ON A PHONE IS AN INBOX, NOT A DIRECTORY.
//
// Under sixty columns ([tierPhone]) home had no shape of its own. The detail
// column went with the width ([homeCardMin]) and nothing else changed, so a
// forty-four-cell frame drew the left column and only the left column: no card,
// no answer chips — you could not approve another window's command from your
// phone — no news, no outcome, no deliverables, no project card, and no `m` to
// reach any of it. One thing on this screen had a narrow shape and it was
// `ask here`, which stacks ([app.homeStacked]).
//
// The fix is not a squeezed dashboard. A dashboard is a thing you SCAN, and
// scanning wants width; a phone-shaped frame is a thing you WALK, one row at a
// time, top to bottom. So at this tier the column stops being a directory of
// projects and becomes an INBOX across all of them:
//
//	 home                        esc close
//	 ─────────────────────────────────────
//	 waiting on you
//	 › ▲ fix the nil-map crash
//	     waiting on you · 12m
//	   ▲ every Monday, the weekly update

//
// FOUR LAWS, AND EVERY ONE OF THEM IS ABOUT A THUMB.
//
//   - TRIAGE FIRST AND ACROSS EVERYTHING. `waiting on you`, `running` and
//     `since you left` are the three questions somebody opens their phone to
//     ask, and none of them is a question about one project — so the sections
//     gather conversations, standing items and errands from every project on the
//     machine. The projects come after them, and only this window's is drawn
//     open; the rest are one line each, exactly as the `elsewhere` block already
//     draws them, without the rule line that costs a row nobody can spare.
//
//   - OPEN TABS COME FIRST, with status bullets followed by bounded closed history.
//     Waiting details may also have a triage row; project groups do not repeat
//     conversations. Their standing items remain below the inbox.
//
//   - THREE, THEN A DOOR. Every section shows three rows and folds the rest into
//     `▸ …N more`, which is the same fold mark, the same word and the same
//     gesture as every other fold on this surface ([bandFoldWord]). A section
//     with nothing in it is not drawn at all — the emptiness law applied to a
//     whole heading.
//
//   - A TRIAGE ROW IS TWO LINES. The label on one, the dim tail under it, which is the
//     two-line law this tier already keeps for every list ([overlayLines]).
//
// AND SEARCH IS UNTOUCHED. Typing filters exactly as it does at every other
// width, with no tiers and no sections ([homeView.buildWorld] states why), and
// the two action rows stay where they have always been — against the box, at
// the foot.
