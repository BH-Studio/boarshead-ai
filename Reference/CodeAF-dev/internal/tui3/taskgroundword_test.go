// ── WHAT THIS SURFACE CALLS THE PLACE A TASK WORKED ─────────────────────────
//
// THE DEFECT: the settled card labelled every task's directory `worktree`. It
// was the machinery's own vocabulary, which this house bans in anything a person
// reads, and it was a claim about a mechanism the card had never checked — a
// repository task is grounded in a fork whenever furrow can make one
// (internal/session's groundladder.go), and the card was telling somebody their
// work had been in a git worktree it never went near.
//
// THE FIX IS ONE TABLE IN THE ENGINE and no words of this package's own
// ([session.GroundWord], keyed by the rung that made the node's world). These
// pin it from the two surfaces that read it — the settled card in the project's
// record, and the landing note a task writes when it comes home — because the
// point of one table is that those two can never say different things about one
// directory.

// groundWordCase is one rung, what was promised about it, and the words the two
// surfaces owe a person for it.
type groundWordCase struct {
	name  string
	rung  session.GroundRung
	mode  session.TaskMode
	label string

// groundWordCases is every rung, plus the two ways a surface can be handed no
// rung at all: a record row written before codeaf wrote the rung down, and a
// node given an empty folder of its own on the reference promise.

// THE SETTLED CARD NAMES THE COPY THE WORK HAPPENED IN, ONE WORDING PER RUNG,
// and never the mechanism. The words are pinned as literals here on purpose: a
// test that asked [session.GroundWord] for them would pass on the day somebody
// quietly changed the table, and these strings are quoted in the manual.
