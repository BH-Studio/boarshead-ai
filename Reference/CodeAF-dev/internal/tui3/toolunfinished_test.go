// ── A CALL THAT NEVER CAME BACK ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The report these tests hold shut: "the view_image tool row in the main chat
// always seems to be running".
//
// Two things were suspected and only one of them was true. Two calls of the same
// tool in one batch DO both settle — the first test pins that, because it is the
// shape the failing session actually had. What did not settle is a call the turn
// ended around: it kept `toolRunning` with no end stamped on it, which looks
// quiet while the session is idle and starts spinning again — from a beginning
// minutes ago — the moment the next turn starts.
