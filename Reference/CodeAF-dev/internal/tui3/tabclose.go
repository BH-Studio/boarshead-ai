// ── CLOSING A TAB THAT IS STILL DOING SOMETHING ─────────────────────────────
//
// Taking a tab off the row has never ended work and does not now: the ✕ closes a
// VIEW, the agent behind it goes on running, and the conversation is still on the
// switcher `alt+k` opens (chattabs.go states that law and is the only place it is
// decided). What was missing was that a person could not SEE that this was what
// happened, and could not ask for the other thing without leaving the tab row.
//
// So a tab with something in flight is asked about once, in the shape this
// surface already asks about ending work (stop.go, whose card this one is a
// sibling of and whose slot it shares):
//
//	 ?  Close this tab? the tree walk is working · 2 tasks running
//	      nothing here is deleted
//	      1  keep running  it keeps going here; find it with alt+k, and ctrl+shift+t brings the tab back
//	      2  stop work     the reply, tasks and jobs stop; nothing is deleted
//	      3  cancel        nothing changes
//	    [enter] take the pick · [esc] cancel · [←→] pick
//
// The block draws those rows (question.go) and this file owns the words in them.
// EACH ANSWER SAYS WHAT IT DOES ON ITS OWN ROW, which is the one line that used
// to change under the cursor: a sentence that moved was a promise about the
// answer you were passing over rather than about the one you were reading.
//
// ── THE THREE ANSWERS ARE THREE DIFFERENT ACTS AND THE CARD SAYS SO ─────────
//
//   - KEEP RUNNING is what the ✕ has always done. The tab leaves the row, the
//     conversation stays in the keeper with its watcher draining and counting
//     (keeper.go), its draft and its reading position are exactly where they
//     were, and it is still on the switcher with `working` or `needs you`
//     against it.
//   - STOP WORK ends the turn and every running node IN THIS CONVERSATION and
//     nothing else, and then the tab leaves the row exactly as above. The
//     transcript is untouched: closing a tab never deletes anything, and this
//     card must not be the place a person learns otherwise.
//   - CANCEL leaves everything — the work, the tab, the draft, the caret —
//     exactly as it was. It is `esc`, which on this surface is always the key
//     that takes a question away without acting.
//
// ── AND THE CURSOR STARTS ON KEEP RUNNING ───────────────────────────────────
//
// stop.go's rule, applied to a different question: the answer under `enter` is
// the one a person gets by pressing the key they press to make a question go
// away, so it has to be the answer that loses nothing. Here that is not the
// refusal — the person asked for the tab to close — it is the one that closes it
// and keeps the work.
//
// ── A TAB WITH NOTHING IN FLIGHT IS NOT ASKED ABOUT AT ALL ──────────────────
//
// [app.tabCloseAsks] is the whole gate, and it reads the strip's own signal
// (tabsignal.go), which opens no file and crosses no wire. A conversation at rest
// closes on the first press with no card, because there is nothing to decide.

// tabCloseCard is one raised question: which tab it is about, what that
// conversation was doing when it was raised, and which answer the cursor is on.
type tabCloseCard struct {
	tab chatTab
	// sig is what the conversation was doing at the moment the card went up. It
	// is kept rather than re-read so the first line does not change under
	// somebody's eyes while they are reading it; what the answers DO is decided
	// against the world as it is when they are taken, which is why the card can
	// safely be answered by a conversation that has finished meanwhile.
	sig tabSignal

//
// THE ORDER IS TWO LAWS AT ONCE on the block that draws them (question.go). The
// FIRST is where the cursor starts — `keep running` wears the SAFE mark, because
// a card whose destructive answer is under the enter key is a card that ends work
// when somebody presses enter to make a question go away. The LAST is what `esc`
// gives — `cancel`, which changes nothing at all, because the dismiss key on this
// surface takes questions away and must not also let a tab go.
