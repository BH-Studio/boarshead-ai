// ── TABLES THAT OPEN ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A TABLE THAT WAS CUT IS A TABLE THE READER CANNOT FINISH READING, AND UNTIL
// NOW THE ONLY WAY TO THE REST OF IT WAS THE RAW REPLY.
//
// internal/tui2/prose fits a table by TRUNCATING its cells, and that decision
// is right and stays: a table's value is the comparison down its columns, a
// wrapped table has no columns, and prose/table.go argues both at length. What
// the decision leaves behind is the case it names and does not answer — a grid
// of ellipses, with the words still in the source and no door to them.
//
// So the surface draws the door. A table whose cells did not fit grows one dim
// row under it, and pressing that row lays the same table out with its cells
// WRAPPED instead of cut. Pressing it again tucks the table back.
//
// THE DOOR ONLY APPEARS WHERE THE PROBLEM DID. A table that fits its column
// renders exactly as it always has, with nothing underneath: an affordance for
// a problem that did not happen is noise, and a row spent on a possibility is a
// row not spent on the conversation.
//
// ── THE CLOSED RENDER IS PROSE'S, BYTE FOR BYTE ──
//
// [renderMarkdown] is a PURE FUNCTION of (text, width) and stays one — every
// tier above the phone renders exactly what prose renders, and
// markdownwrap_test.go's TestWideTiersUnchanged pins that byte for byte. So
// none of this happens inside it. The document is rendered whole, exactly as
// before, and only THEN is each table located in the finished rows: closed, it
// keeps prose's own bytes and gains a foot; open, its rows are swapped for this
// file's.
//
// The location is not guessed. A top-level table rendered ALONE at the same
// width produces exactly the rows prose gave it inside the document — a table
// lays out in the figure width, the figure width is the full width less the
// container gutter, and a table at column zero is in no container (mdSegments
// recognizes no other kind). So the table is FOUND: the isolated rendering is
// looked for as a run of rows, searching forward from where the last table
// ended, and A TABLE THIS FILE CANNOT FIND GETS NO FOOT. Every way this can be
// wrong therefore ends in the rendering the surface had yesterday, which is the
// property that lets a splice sit under a pinned test at all.
//
// ── OPENING IS A LAYOUT DECISION, NOT A SETTING ──
//
// The person asked to see the cells; they did not ask to choose a layout. So
// the surface picks the honest one for the width it has:
//
//   - WRAPPED COLUMNS, when every column can hold its widest word. The same
//     grid, the same gap, the same hairline under the header — a cell that is
//     too long becomes several rows inside its own column instead of an
//     ellipsis. A record that spans rows is separated from the next by a blank
//     one, because at that point the eye needs to be told where a record stops.
//   - STACKED RECORDS, when it cannot: `header: value` a line at a time, which
//     is what the phone tier already does with every table ([phoneTableRows])
//     and for the same reason — under some width a grid stops being a grid, and
//     a column three cells wide is a column of confetti.
//
// ── AND IT IS ALSO HOW YOU COPY A TABLE ──
//
// Copy mode yanks the RENDERED rows (copymode.go), so an opened table is the
// only way to put a table's real content on the clipboard: what a closed one
// offers is the ellipses the reader can already see.
//
// ── THE KEYBOARD ──
//
// There is no chord for this wave, and that is a stated gap rather than an
// oversight. Every other pressable thing on this surface is reachable from a
// cursor that walks blocks ([app.selectTool]), and a table is not a block that
// walk visits — prose is not selectable here. The words are not lost to a
// person with ui.mouse off either: the model's reply is still in the transcript
// whole, which is exactly where they were before this file existed.

const (
	// mdTableGap is the whitespace between two columns of an OPENED table.
	//
	// It is two cells because prose spends two (prose/table.go's tableGap), and
	// it is restated here because that constant is unexported. THE TWO HAVE TO
	// AGREE: a table that changed the distance between its columns when it
	// opened would read as a second table rather than as the same one, and the
	// gesture claims to be showing the reader what they were already looking at.

	// below this floor the honest answer is the stacked one. A column that never
	// wanted this much (a column of "opus" and "sonnet") is not held to it: the
	// floor is a minimum ASKED FOR, not a minimum granted.

// of ellipses wants the table opened, and says so in those words. The ellipsis
// leading each one is the same glyph that cut the cells (prose's own overflow
