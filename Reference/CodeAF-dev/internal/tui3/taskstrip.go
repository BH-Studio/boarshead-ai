// THE TASK STRIP: ONE ROW THAT ALWAYS HAS A DOOR IN IT.
//
// The roster is thirty columns on the right and it is the first thing a narrow
// frame gives up (task.go's railSlimFloor). That was the right trade for the
// conversation and the wrong one for the work: under a hundred columns — a
// phone over mosh, a split pane, a terminal somebody dragged half-shut — a
// running node had NO door at all. It was in the transcript as a card that
// scrolled away, and nowhere else. "Where is the thing that is running" is the
// question this surface exists to answer, and on the frames people actually
// carry around it could not answer it.
//
// So there is one row, under the pinned header, that says what is alive:
//
//	⠙ Fix nil-map · ◆ Auth tests · +2
//
// It is a TAB ROW and not a summary. Every chip is a door — click it and you
// are in that node's room — and the +N at its end is the door to the whole
// roster, which at a narrow width opens over the frame (task.go's [app.railFull]).
// It is drawn at EVERY width, because a row of tabs and a column of rows answer
// different questions: the strip says what is happening now, in one glance,
// above whatever a person is reading; the roster says what the session has done
// all day. The strip goes away the moment nothing is running, which is what
// keeps it from becoming another permanent bar.
//
// THE CHIP IS A GLYPH AND A NAME. The glyph is the node's STATE where it has
// one worth drawing — the spinner while it runs, ✓ and ✗ once it is over — and
// its IDENTITY otherwise (taskident.go's ◆, keyed on the id and stable for the
// node's whole life), which is the same pair of cells the roster opens its rows
// with. The name is the two-or-three-word title, cut to fit. Nothing else: a
// clock, a spend or a tool name on this row would make it a dashboard, and the
// room is one keystroke away.
//
// ── AND THE CHIP IS SHAPED LIKE A CHIP ──
//
// It used to be a bare run of text with a middot beside it, which is the shape
// of a LIST, and the row is not a list — it is the tab bar for the page below
// it. Read as a list, the one thing the row exists to say last of all was the
// thing hardest to see: which of these doors you are standing in. So a chip is
// padded, one cell each side, and the padding is what a band has to fill:
//
//	  ⠙ Fix nil-map    ◆ Auth tests   +2
//	 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//	 the room you are in, banded
//
// TWO MARKS, BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO QUESTIONS. The OPEN chip — the room the body
// is drawing — takes the band and the accent, which is the emphasis this
// surface already spends on "the row you picked" (styles.go's [palette.selected],
// one step above the pointer's own hover). The FOCUSED chip — wherever the
// roster's cursor is standing while it holds the keyboard (task.go's
// [app.railWhere]) — takes an underline instead, so that moving the cursor
// across the row never once looks like opening something. A chip can wear both,
// and when it does both are legible, which is the point of picking two channels
// rather than two shades of one.
//
// THE CURSOR IS THE ROSTER'S AND NOT A SECOND ONE. A tab row with a keyboard
// model of its own would be a third list to navigate on a surface that already
// has the column and the transcript; the strip is a VIEW of the roster's live
// set, so it shows the roster's cursor and adds no keys.
//
// The padding also belongs to the CHIP for the pointer: [stripSpan] covers it,
// so the cell beside a name opens the same room the name does. A one-cell gap
// separates two chips, which is what is left over once each one carries its own
// air — the middot went with the list it punctuated.
//
// ── AND THE ROSTER OWNS THE SHAPE ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// An adaptive run is not a task. It is a task that keeps SPAWNING tasks, for as
// long as its planner has something left to want (internal/orchestrate), and a
// row of sibling chips is a lie about it: eight chips that read as eight jobs
// somebody asked for, when what happened is one job that grew seven. The shape
// is the news — what came out of what, and which limb is still moving.
//
// THAT TREE IS THE ROSTER'S AND NOT THIS ROW'S. It was drawn here for a while,
// growing downward out of a pinned row and folding itself to a budget the frame
// set, which made the one surface a person cannot scroll the one surface that
// decided for itself how many rows of conversation to eat. The column on the
// right is the shape a tree wants — it is already tall, it already scrolls, and
// a person can fold it themselves (task.go's [app.railEntries]) — so the tree
// lives there and this file kept the thing it was always good at.
//
// SO THE STRIP IS THE NARROW FRAME'S DOOR AND NOTHING ELSE. It stands DOWN
// wherever the roster is standing ([app.stripShowing]): a tab row above a column
// listing the same work is a row of conversation spent on an index to the thing
// beside it. Under [railSlimFloor] there is no column to lend, so this row is
// the only door there is, and it draws at every width down to [stripFloor] — one
// line, the live chips packed across it, the +N at its end.

const (
	// stripFloor is the narrowest frame that gets a strip. Under it there is not
	// a chip's worth of room, and the row would be an ellipsis with a glyph in
	// front of it.
	stripFloor = 24
	// stripTitleCap is how much of a name one chip may spend. Eighteen is the
	// rail's own title budget at the full width — the same name, cut the same
	// way, so a node reads identically in both places.
	stripTitleCap = 18
	// stripGap is what separates two chips, and stripGapCols is its width in
	// CELLS. The two are stated apart because a budget measured in bytes would
	// fit fewer chips than the row can hold the moment the separator is not
	// ASCII.
	stripGap     = " "
	stripGapCols = 1
	// stripPad is the air inside a chip, one cell each side. It is what makes a

// ── THE PARENT SEAM ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// These two are the whole of what the roster's forest reads (task.go's
// [app.railKin]). The parent is filled from the
// engine's own updates (session's TaskNotice.Parent), and TWO KINDS OF WORK FILL
// IT: an adaptive run, which takes one row with a row under it for every node it
// cuts (session's orchestrate.go), and a TASK THAT SPLIT ITS OWN BRIEF, whose
// pieces are registered under it (session's task.go). Neither is anything to
// this package: a family is a family. A session that has run neither answers ""
// and false to both, which is the flat row, unchanged — and that is what keeps
// this a seam rather than a rewrite.
//
// Paused is filled the same way, from session's TaskNotice.Paused: an adaptive
// run that has spent its tank publishes its OWN row held at the gate until
// somebody tops it up, finishes it or stops it, and the workers under it keep
// publishing whatever they are actually doing. The run's page still asks the
// question; the paused mark is how the column says the run is standing still
// while it does.
//
// THE KEY IS A STRING AND THE ID IS NOT, on purpose. The thing that will fill
// it is an orchestrate node id (internal/orchestrate's [orchestrate.Node.ID] —
// "n3", not a number), so a uint64 here would be a conversion in the adapter
// and a lie in the type. And "" is an honest "nobody spawned this", where 0 is
// an id that could one day exist.

// ParentID is the key of the task this one was spawned under, or "" at a root.
func (n *taskNode) ParentID() string { return n.parent }

// Paused reports whether this task is HELD rather than working: an adaptive run
// stopped at its fuel gate, waiting for a person to top it up or finish it
// (session's EventOrchestratePause, and TaskNotice.Paused on the row). It is not
// a state the engine moves a node through, which is why it is a fact of its own
// — a paused node is still running as far as the run is concerned, and it is not
// moving as far as a person is concerned, and the second reading is the one a
// roster owes them. The reading that decides how the ROW is grouped and counted
// is [session.ProjectTask]'s, which takes the same fact through

// strip out on every one of them would be the whole session paying for a row
// that is three chips wide (hover.go's ceiling). The y test is a subtraction, and
// past it the layout is the same layout the press does — which is what keeps the
// set that lights and the set that answers one set.

// A PRESS BETWEEN TWO CHIPS IS SWALLOWED AND NOTHING LIGHTS THERE, and the two
// are not in disagreement: the row eats the miss so it cannot fall through to the
// conversation, and a gap that brightened would be claiming to be a door.
