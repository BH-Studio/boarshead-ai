// SWEEP TO COPY, CLICK ON RELEASE. dragselect.go's two halves of one bargain:
// mouse reporting takes the terminal's own drag-select away, so the drag is
// answered in kind — sweep and the rows are copied — and the price is that the
// body's click moved from press to release, which is where every GUI has fired
// a click since there were GUIs.
