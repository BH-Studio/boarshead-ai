// THE DECISION, PUT WHERE THE PERSON IS STANDING — AND ASKED BY THE ONE THING
// THAT ASKS EVERYTHING.
//
// A task that finishes with nobody able to say whether it holds lands as the
// person's call. It is neither done nor incomplete, its branch is kept, and
// everything queued behind it waits. This file used to draw that question
// itself: its own two rows, its own five letters, its own receipts, its own
// pointer, and three copies of the same routing for the conversation, the room
// and the roster's focused row.
//
// IT DOES NOT ANY MORE. A landed `your call` is a [session.Question] — the
// engine builds it over [session.TaskAsk] itself (internal/session's
// question.go, `landingQuestion`), publishes it the moment the node lands and
// again every time the node moves (task_landing_question.go), and the question
// block draws it in whichever form its evidence asks for, on every page, with
// the one key grammar (question.go, questionkeys.go, questionroom.go). The keys
// are still task-states' own — `[a] <yes> · [n] <no> · [s] tell it`
// (docs/design/task-states/DESIGN.md, [session.LandingYesKey] and its
// neighbours) — and they are now answered through [session.Agent.ResolveQuestion]
// like every other decision this engine hands a person.
//
// ── WHY THE ROWS HAD TO GO RATHER THAN STAND BESIDE THE BLOCK ──
//
// A question drawn twice on one screen is worse than a question drawn in the
// older place: a person answering the second copy of a decision they already
// made is the exact failure the one-renderer wave exists to end. So when the
// block claimed this lane (question.go's [app.questionDrawnHere]) these rows had
// to leave with it.
//
// ── WHAT IS LEFT HERE ──
//
// The landing CARD is still this surface's — the head, the facts and the reason
// row are the record of how work came home and are not an answer to anything
// (taskdone.go) — and finding that card by a node's id is what the room, the
// roster and the record page all do. That lookup, and the redraw after a card
// changes, are the whole of this file now.

// doneEntryFor is the index of the LATEST landed card for one node, or -1. The
// latest, because the engine lands a node more than once — once needing a look,
// and again as done or incomplete once somebody decided — and the newest card is
// the one that says where the work stands now.

// settleTouched is the redraw after a card changed, wherever the change came
// from: the conversation's copy of the row is dropped, and so is the room's

// asked about it, they move at different times, and a surface that worked the
// second out of the first is how a re-landed node came to draw the first
// landing's frozen answers (#767). Both lanes are asked because a landing whose
