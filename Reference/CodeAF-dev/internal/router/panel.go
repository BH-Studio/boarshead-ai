// Package router turns one model into a panel of them.
//
// It exists because of a measured result rather than an intuition. Two labs
// (bench/routerlab, bench/probelab) asked whether a harness can spend less and
// get more by not sending every call to the same model, and the answer they
// converged on is narrow and specific: predicting which model will fail does not
// pay, but *trying the cheap one and escalating on a verified failure* does. On
// a 36-task suite that policy reached 0.974 success at $0.000148 a task against
// the incumbent single model's 0.875 at $0.000076 — and it beat the best single
// model on the panel outright, at a sixth of that model's price.
//
// Everything here follows from that one sentence. The cascade needs a verifier,
// so verification is the centre of the design and an unverifiable call is
// treated as evidence about nothing. The order of the rungs needs an ability
// estimate, so there is a ledger — a one-parameter Rasch rating per model and
// call class, because the labs tested the two-parameter alternative and it did
// not pay for itself. And the ability estimate may not be seeded from price:
// measured against ability, log output price correlated at r = 0.46 with n = 7,
// and the second-cheapest model on the panel had the second-highest ability
// while the second-dearest sat sixth of seven.
//
// The whole package is inert unless CODEAF_MODELS names a panel. With it unset
// the harness builds the same single adapter it always did, and nothing below
// this line runs.
