// The update rule, and why every constant in it is a brake.
//
// This is a Rasch (one-parameter) update: one ability per model and class, no
// discrimination term. That is not a simplification made for convenience — the
// router lab fitted both and tested them against each other, and the
// two-parameter model lost on a likelihood ratio of 11.63 on 15 degrees of
// freedom, p = 0.71, AIC 137.4 against 155.8. Fifteen extra parameters bought
// less than chance would give. Routing needs ability and nothing else.
//
// Unpenalized maximum likelihood *breaks* on data of this shape, and that is the
// reason for the rest. A model that passes everything it has been shown has a
// likelihood that rises without bound: the lab's first fit ran one model's
// ability to +42 logits, made the observed information singular, inflated every
// standard error to about 470 and collapsed separation reliability to zero. So
// the step is clamped, the step size decays as evidence accumulates, and a
// diffuse N(0, 3²) prior pulls back toward the middle with a weight that itself
// decays as 1/n. Two prior standard deviations span ±6 logits — success
// probabilities from 0.0025 to 0.9975 — so the prior barely touches a rating the
