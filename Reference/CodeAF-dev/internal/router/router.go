// The operator's role hint is the primary key and the measurement is the
// tie-break, which is the opposite of what the rating is for everywhere else in
// this file. The reason is that a rating can only demote a model somebody has
// measured, and the failure being fixed here was a model nobody had: the panel's
// strong model served zero calls in the entire experiment, so its rating was
// forever its cold-start prior while the cheap incumbent's climbed past it on
// real evidence. Ordering the terminal seat by rating therefore hands it to
// whichever model has been *used* most successfully, which is precisely the model
// the cascade is supposed to be able to escalate away from.
//
// `role: top` is a claim the operator is making about where the ceiling is, and
// the panel is written so that claim is true — bench/routerlab picked its top
// model as "the terminal cascade rung" on an anchor battery, offline, before any
// of this ran. Honouring it costs nothing when it is right and is correctable by
// measuring the model, which is what the exploration budget is for. Within a
// role the measurement decides, and a panel that declares no roles falls through
// to rating and then to the order it was written in — the last model written,
// because a panel is written in trial order and trial order runs the weakest
// first, so the operator's last line is the operator's ceiling. That is the
// mirror of the value ordering's tie-break, which prefers the earlier line for
// the same reason read the other way round.
