// The identity senior-dev's own commits carry.
//
// senior-dev commits as it works: its exact starting tree, every file its
// model writes, each coherent checkpoint and the candidate it submits. A
// working copy on a machine that has never been told who is committing (a
// fresh container, a hermetic HOME) refuses every one of those commits, and a
// refused candidate commit is a submission the run cannot make. So each git
// command that can commit carries an identity of its own, as `-c` overrides,
// which GIT_AUTHOR_* and GIT_COMMITTER_* in the environment still win over.
//
// These commits stay on the branch codeaf cut for the run, under the one
// commit codeaf makes of whatever the run left uncommitted when it ended,
// which carries codeaf's identity rather than this one. The address is a local
// one: it names the program that made a commit and no account anywhere.

// The values live in internal/gitidentity, which codeaf's own side of a run
// reads on every platform.
