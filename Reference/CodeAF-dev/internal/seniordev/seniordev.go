//go:build !windows

// Package seniordev is senior-dev: an autonomous coding agent codeaf carries
// and runs, and nothing else can. It takes one brief, works in the folder it is
// handed — on the branch codeaf cut for it there when the folder is a git
// repository (internal/session's programfolder.go) — under a model it reaches
// only through codeaf, submits a frozen candidate,
// checks it with the project's own build and tests, and ends with one record
// that keeps what its model claimed apart from what it saw
// (internal/seniordev/app; its own account of the run is ARCHITECTURE.md in
// the repository it came from, swe-pro-go at the tag codeaf-absorb).
//
// IT HAS NO ENTRY POINT OF ITS OWN. What codeaf needs of it is a
// delegate.Delegate value, and its one command's body takes a delegate.Host,
// which only codeaf makes: `/senior-dev <brief>` in the chat, and
// `codeaf senior-dev <brief>` at a shell. There is no binary, no key it reads
// and no stdout it writes to but the host's records.
//
// ON WINDOWS IT IS ABSENT. Its engine leans on process groups, file locks and
// a bash shell it has never had a Windows form of, so every runnable file
// under this tree carries a !windows constraint and the build's list carries
// nothing there (internal/delegate/builtin/carried_windows.go). The guide
// lives outside this Unix-only tree so the prefix gate can weigh it anywhere.

	// What the chat's model reads before it names senior-dev in `via`. The
	// brief is copied word for word into .senior-dev/spec.md and is all it ever
	// knows of the work, so the guide says what that brief must settle. Its
	// folder is codeaf's to choose and to read: a plain one is handed over
	// with PlainFolder on the line, so the guide says nothing about git.
	//
	// IT CLAIMS THE HARD CODING WORK, BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT IT IS FOR. It said
	// "one large code change worth an hour", a price no piece of work seems to
	// clear before it is opened: an issue in a mature project whose cause runs
	// through several files reads, from its report, as a few edits the chat
	// could make itself. The owner asked on 2026-09-24 that codeaf reach for
	// senior-dev by itself on complicated, many-sided coding work, the kind a
	// hard software-engineering benchmark is made of, so the guide names that
	// work, and the paragraph it is printed under says codeaf prefers a program
	// for whatever its guide claims (internal/session/delegate_door.go). THE
	// BRIEF CARRIES THE ISSUE IN FULL: a summary of a bug report is the one
	// thing senior-dev cannot check against, since there is nobody it can ask
	// what the report said.
	Guide: programguide.SeniorDev,
	Lands: delegate.LandsTree,
	// Its recorder is git unless it is told --in-place, which keeps its
	// checkpoints outside the folder and commits nothing. codeaf passes it for

	// the home folder — because the recorder's own reading climbs to any
	// repository around the folder.
	PlainFolder: []string{"--in-place"},

	// checklist, the pinned command, its session database and its model

// run. A seat the crew leaves unset keeps senior-dev's own default for it.
//
// THE PLANNING SEAT IS NOT HANDED OVER, BECAUSE NOTHING WOULD USE IT. It went
// to senior-dev's frontier tier, and senior-dev routes exactly two kinds of
// call: the coder's turns on the high pool and the history summary on the low
// one (baked/tier.go). No call rides the frontier tier, so the flag changed
// nothing, while the manual told the person their mastermind model handled
// senior-dev's hardest calls.
//
// MODELS THE PERSON ASKED FOR ARE THE WORKING POOL, AND ARE KEPT AS ASKED.
// They go on --high in place of the crew's working seat, with --asked, which
// takes that pool out of the crew's leniency: a model the person named that
