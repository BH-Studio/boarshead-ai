// senior-dev's page, in senior-dev's words: every line of its action log — a
// stage, a step, its ending — as what a person reads under the step of its
// process it served (delegate.Delegate's Present). codeaf draws the page;
// what senior-dev's records MEAN is said here, once, beside the words its
// stages already have.
//
// THE PAGE SHOWS ONLY WHAT senior-dev REALLY DOES. It has no planner, no
// reviewer and no subagent (baked/agents/coder.md): one model context works
// through its spec, explores, pins a check, lists the requirements, implements
// and hands in, in the order that model chooses; senior-dev then checks the
// tree itself with the project's own build and tests and finishes. Around that
// it compacts its model's memory, moves to another model, and steers its model
// when it stops short — and each of those is a line here, said as senior-dev
// steering its own work. Everything else it reports is machinery, and is left
// out.
