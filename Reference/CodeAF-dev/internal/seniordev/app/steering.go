// WORDS FROM THE PERSON'S SIDE REACH THE MODEL BETWEEN ITS STEPS.
//
// senior-dev used to read nothing after its brief, so a person watching it
// spend an hour on the wrong file could only stop it. codeaf now hands a
// listening program messages while it works (delegate's inbox.go): the person's
// words from the task's page and the conversation's `say`. senior-dev takes them
// at the two places its own process already speaks to its model:
//
//   - before each model call inside a turn, through the step loop's reminder
//     hook (turn.BetweenStepReminder), which saves the words into the session
//     as a message of their own, exactly as the loop saves any other; and
//   - when the model ends a turn without handing in, in place of the nudge —
//     and without counting as one, because the model did not stall, somebody
//     spoke to it.
//
// A MESSAGE IS NEVER TAKEN MID-CALL. Cutting a call the model is answering
// throws away half an answer and lands in the turn-error road; the longest a
// message waits is one call and the tool it asked for.
//
// EVERY MESSAGE TAKEN IS KEPT IN .senior-dev/steering.md, and compaction pins
// that file beside the brief (session/compaction's steering pin), because a
// summary drops the loop's own messages and a direction given at minute ten is
// still the direction at minute ninety. The file sits in senior-dev's own
// notes, which are never part of what it hands in.
//
// AND SENIOR-DEV SAYS IT HEARD, ONCE THE WORDS ARE SAVED WHERE ITS NEXT CALL
// READS THEM. The receipt is what lets codeaf mark a note delivered and the page
// say the model was given it, so it waits for the save: a message read from the
// inbox and lost to a run killed before the save is not heard, and codeaf says
// so when the run ends. The inbox closes when it hands in, because a frozen
// tree cannot take direction, and codeaf refuses later words with that reason.

// steeringFile is where the messages taken are kept, relative to the workspace.

// senior-dev's page draws as a steering line (internal/seniordev's actions.go).

// takeSteering reads the messages waiting in the inbox and answers the words
// the model is handed and the receipt to give once those words are saved where
// its next call reads them; "" and nil when there are none or nobody can send
// any. The receipt is given at most once.
