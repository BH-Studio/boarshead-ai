// workspaceRecorder is how a run identifies, compares, freezes and restores

// git: git is one way to keep these promises, not the only one.
//
// Identifiers (the strings returned by Base, Snapshot and Record) are opaque.
// The run passes them back in and compares them for equality; it never parses
// them. Under the git recorder they are object names, which is why they read
// like SHAs in the event stream.

// broken .git, a machine with no git — gets the snapshot recorder, exactly as
// --in-place would. A run never ends for want of git.
//
// Inference only ever steps DOWN from git, never up. --in-place still forces
// the snapshot recorder inside a real repository, because a run there that
// must not touch the history is indistinguishable, from the filesystem, from
// one that should; that choice stays the caller's (codeaf makes it for a
// repository rooted at the home folder).
