// A stage's data goes two places. The whole of it goes to stderr, one line per
// stage, for a person reading why the run did what it did (eventWriter's
// noteStage). A small copy of it goes on the protocol's `stage` record, for
// codeaf's page to say in words: which attempt, how many requirements were
// ticked, how many files the hand-in held, what the project's own check
// found.
//
// THE COPY IS CURATED, NEVER COMPUTED. Every value on the record is a value the
// run already put in the stage's data; this file only chooses which, shortens a
// sentence and counts a list. Nothing here is new knowledge, and nothing here
// reaches the model.

// stageDataKeys are the keys a stage record may carry, each a plain fact a
// page can say. Tree and commit ids, paths and the run's environment are left
// to stderr: they are machinery, and a page has nothing to say with them.
//
// THE CODER'S POOL IS THE ONE LIST CARRIED WHOLE. `bootstrap` names the models
// the run works on and its effort, which codeaf shows on the task's page so a
// person can see what the run was launched on (delegate.StageRecord.Models);
// a count of them would say nothing.
