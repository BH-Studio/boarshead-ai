// These strings are the run instruction: the first user message of a solo run,
// and the bounded continuations sent when a turn ends without a submission.
//
// They carry mechanics only -- the files the run uses, what senior-dev does on
// its own, and what ends the run. They do not tell the model when to edit, how
// much to explore, or how fast to move; those are its decisions, and a sentence
// spent on them is a sentence competing with the repository it is about to
// read. Keep every claim here true of this binary: a prompt that describes
// behaviour the code does not have is worse than a prompt that omits it.

// soloSystemPreamble frames the run instruction and nothing else. The detail is
// in the sections, and a long preamble is what a model under context pressure
// drops first.
const soloSystemPreamble = `You are implementing one change in this repository, by yourself, in one context.

What follows is how this run works: the files it uses, what senior-dev does,
and what ends it.`

// soloIntakeSection names the specification file. Intake writes .senior-dev/spec.md
// verbatim and compaction re-pins it from disk, so it is the one copy of the
// request that outlives the conversation.
const soloIntakeSection = `## The specification

.senior-dev/spec.md holds the request verbatim. It is the specification, and it is
re-pinned from that file whenever this context is compacted.`

// soloExploreSection names the pinned-command file. readPinnedCommand takes the
// first line of .senior-dev/pinned.txt and quotes it back in the nudge findings and
// in a later run's header, so the file has a reader even when the model forgets
// what it wrote there.
const soloExploreSection = `## The verification command

Write the build or test command you verify with to .senior-dev/pinned.txt, on one
line. senior-dev reads that first line and quotes it back to you if this run
needs a continuation.`

// soloImplementSection states what the workspace is and what leaves it. The
// exclusion list is seniorDevArtifactPathspecs: if the two disagree, submit
// accepts a tree whose only content is senior-dev's own bookkeeping.
const soloImplementSection = `## The workspace

The workspace is a git repository. Your tools are the ones declared with this
turn: a shell, file reading, editing, search, web access, and submit.

.senior-dev/ and git-ignored paths are excluded from the answer. Everything else in
the working tree, committed or not, is part of what you submit.

Only the workspace is handed back. The file tools refuse to write outside it, and
anything a shell command changes outside it is lost: do the work here.`

// soloConformanceSection names the checklist file. soloFreeze refuses a
// submission when it is missing and records its item and tick counts when it is
// present, and soloChecklistItem matches both "[ ] x" and "- [ ] x".
const soloConformanceSection = `## The checklist

Write .senior-dev/checklist.md: one line per thing the request requires, each
starting "[ ] ", ticked to "[x]" when the code satisfies it. submit refuses if
this file does not exist, and records its item and tick counts.`

// soloSubmitSection is the completion protocol. It has to agree with the system
// prompt that the run ends by calling submit and by nothing else: when the two
// disagreed, the model followed the system prompt.
const soloSubmitSection = `## Ending the run

The run ends when you call the submit tool. Nothing else ends it: no status
tag, no report, no summary.

submit takes a reason, the evidence you verified with, and checklist_satisfied.
It refuses, naming the cause, when the tree is unchanged from the starting
commit, when .senior-dev/checklist.md does not exist, when reason or evidence is
empty, or when this run already submitted. A refusal does not end the run.

An accepted submit freezes the tree at that instant. senior-dev then runs this
project's own build and test entrypoints itself and records what they report;
that cannot change what ships, and neither can anything you edit afterwards — a
tree that moves after a submission is reverted to the frozen one.

A run that never submits is recorded as unsubmitted and leaves behind the tree
as it stands, except that a tree whose suite cannot start is restored to an
earlier one.`

// soloDependenciesSection is how a run gets what the project's build and tests
// need and the machine lacks. It is part of the instruction only when the run
// may reach the network (netpolicy): with egress off nothing can be installed,
// and a paragraph about installing would only send the model to probe a
// network it does not have.
//
// IT EXISTS BECAUSE A MISSING DEPENDENCY WAS WORKED AROUND, NEVER FETCHED. With
// nothing saying installing was allowed, runs on a machine with no pytest used
// unittest instead, and one wrote a `pytest.py` stand-in into the project so
// the post-submit check would pass. A system Python that refuses `pip
// install` (PEP 668, Homebrew's) is why the environment is the project's own,
// and senior-dev's check runs with the project's `.venv` active, so what is
// installed there is what the check uses.
const soloDependenciesSection = `## Dependencies

When the project's build or tests need a tool or package this machine does not
have, install it into the project's own environment and use it from there: for
Python a virtual environment at .venv in the project (` + "`python3 -m venv .venv`" + `,
then ` + "`.venv/bin/python -m pip install ...`" + `, or ` + "`uv sync`" + `), for Node ` + "`npm ci`" + ` or the
project's own package manager, for other ecosystems their usual fetch. Never
install into the system (no ` + "`sudo`" + `, no ` + "`--break-system-packages`" + `, no global
installs), and never write a stand-in for a missing tool. senior-dev runs its
own check of the project with .venv active when there is one.`
