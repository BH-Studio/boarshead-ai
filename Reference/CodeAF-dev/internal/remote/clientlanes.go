// clientlanes.go is the surface's half of version 11's harness lane.
//
// IT IS THE SAME FOUR PIECES tasklane.go's surface half has — fold a frame into
// the lane, end the lane when the connection does, hand out a fresh subscription
// per conversation, and answer the question the lane raises — because
// internal/tui3 asserts a lane and its answer as ONE interface. A wire holding
// the events and not the answer leaves a card drawn and unanswerable, which is
// the fault the task rail was found in.
//
// THE METHOD NAMES ARE THE SESSION'S, so a hosted surface satisfies the same
// optional interfaces a local one does and internal/tui3 needs no line about
// which kind of agent it is holding.
