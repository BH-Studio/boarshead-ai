// wakelane.go is THE TURNS THE CONVERSATION STARTS ON ITS OWN, ACROSS A
// CONNECTION.
//
// A wake is the turn a landed task, an exited job or a fired watch starts with
// nobody having typed anything (internal/session's [Agent.wakeLocked]). The
// session hands each one to its wake lanes BEFORE the turn's first event, and a
// local surface holds one for its whole life and draws the turn from its first
// delta (internal/tui3's watchWakes). A surface arriving mid-wake is handed the
// stream by its welcome ([Welcome.Live]), and a returning one by the replay.
//
// A HOSTED ENGINE HELD NOTHING, AND THAT WAS THE BUG — tasklane.go's, one lane
// over. The turn still ran: the hosted engine is a *session.Agent whose own
// wake declines nothing, so the report reached the model and the answer reached
// the journal, retries and all. But no stream was minted for the turn, no
// "turn" frame said it had begun, and no event crossed the wire, so a surface
// attached to that conversation sat reading idle while the engine spent
// minutes on a provider fault, and the answer that finally landed never reached
// the screen. It was in the transcript for whoever opened the conversation
// NEXT, and invisible to the person sitting in front of it — a task card that
// said done, and no word about it.
//
// THE FIX IS THE ADOPTION A SECOND WINDOW ALREADY GETS, AND NOTHING MORE. A
// wake turn is a turn this window did not start, which is the one shape the
// wire has drawn since version 4 ([Turn], [Client.Follow]): mint the stream so
// an arriving surface finds it in its welcome, tell the room so every surface
// binds the stream before its first event, and hand the events to
// [Session.pump], which numbers them, fans them out to everybody watching and
// closes them exactly as it does for a turn somebody submitted. No new frame
// kind, no new method, and a surface cannot tell a wake from a watched turn —
// which is the point.
//
// THE SUBSCRIPTION IS ONE PER CONVERSATION AND NOT ONE PER WINDOW, unlike the
// task lane's, because the fan-out is the session's own: one minted stream
// reaches every surface through [Session.emit], and a second subscription would
// mint a second stream for the same turn and draw it twice. It is opened at
// [NewSession] rather than on demand for the same reason the ring is opened at
// the mint: a conversation that wakes while NOBODY is attached still journals
// its answer, and the wake that is running when a surface arrives is the one
// fact the welcome must be able to name.

// pump, which goes quiet by generation exactly as a swapped turn's does.
//
// A WAKE THAT OUTLIVES ITS CONVERSATION IS DRAINED AND NEVER MINTED. The lane
// is buffered, so a stream can be sitting on it when the conversation is

// the one its lane belongs to, and the question "is that still the
// conversation being served" is asked in the same hold of the lock that would
// mint — anything else names a stream in the new conversation for events the
// old one produced. The stream itself is still drained, because the channel
// has a session writing into it and an unread one parks that writer's pump
// forever ([Agent.wakeLocked]'s sink exists for exactly this).
