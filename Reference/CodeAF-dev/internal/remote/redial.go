// ── ROAMING ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// redial.go is the difference between a conversation that lives on a link and
// one that lives on a machine. The engine's session is on the far machine and
// the journal is on the far machine's disk; the pipe between here and there is
// the one part of the arrangement that a café's wifi, a VPN's flap or a closed
// lid can take away. So when it goes, the surface opens another one and says
// where it got to ([Hello.Resume]) — the conversation never noticed.
//
// IT IS THE READER GOROUTINE THAT REDIALS, and that is not a detail: a reader
// whose link has died has nothing to read, so there is no second goroutine to
// invent and no window in which two of them could both be handshaking. The law
// client.go states — one writer, one reader, one pump per stream — survives the
// whole of this file.
//
// THE ROAMING IS BOUNDED AND THE BOUND IS SAID OUT LOUD. It keeps trying for
// [RoamWindow] and no longer, the note on the screen names that span while it
// is trying, and when it gives up the sentence a person reads is the one this
// package has always said about a lost connection — `the connection to devbox
// is gone — run the same command to pick the conversation back up`. There is no
// second vocabulary for a link that ended, because there is no second thing
// that happened.
//
// AND IT PROMISES NOTHING THE FAR END DOES NOT. A redial gets the turn back
// only if the engine is a persistent one ([Welcome.Persistent]); against the
// other honest shape — `codeaf engine` on a pipe — a redial gets a FRESH engine
// and the turn that was in flight is over. [Client.reconcile] says so on the
// turn itself rather than leaving a person to work it out from a reply that
// stopped mid-sentence, and it says so again if the engine came back with a
// different conversation open than the one this window left.

//     nothing happened that a person needs to know about: the gap's events
//     arrive as ordinary event frames and the duplicates client.go drops are
//     invisible by construction.
//   - The engine came back with a DIFFERENT conversation open than the one this
//     window left. The transcript on screen belongs to the old one, so the swap
//     is announced rather than made under the person, and the streams of the
//     conversation we left are ended.
//   - The far end is not persistent ([Welcome.Persistent] false), so a redial
//     got a FRESH engine. The conversation is still on that machine's disk and
//     the journal has everything that reached it, but the turn that was in
//     flight is over and nothing is going to finish it.
