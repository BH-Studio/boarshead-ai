// ── THE CONVERSATION'S POSTURE ON THE TOOL GATE, ACROSS THE WIRE ────────────
//
// internal/session holds the posture and its door (approvalposture.go), and
// this file is effort.go's shape one dial over: a hosted conversation gets the
// approvals chip, the chord and the command, on the machine the conversation
// runs on — which is the only machine whose gate they could honestly move.
//
// THE READ A FRAME TAKES IS NOT A CALL. The posture is drawn on the seam beside
// the rung on every repaint, so it rides the fact set the engine states unasked
// ([session.Facts.Approval], replica.go) and this end answers from memory. The
// two calls below happen on a KEYSTROKE and never on a frame.
//
// AND THE CAPABILITY IS THE WELCOME'S TO ANSWER, for [Welcome.Effort]'s reason:
// every connection has these methods on it, and "" is what a far engine with no
// posture door answers as well as what a session with no gate answers. So
// [Welcome.Approval] says whether the far engine has the door, and a surface
// reads it before it offers to move anything ([Agent.ApprovalDial]). An engine
// too old to have it leaves the chip a reading of [Welcome.ApprovalMode] — the
// far machine's row, carried once — and the surface's doors say so.

// approvalDoor is the posture as an engine must have it to serve one: the
// slice of *session.Agent this file speaks to.

// dial, exactly as it has none locally.

// chord, the press and the command cannot mean two things depending on which
// machine the conversation is on.
//
// IT READS THE RESOLVED POSTURE BACK BEFORE IT RETURNS, on
// [Agent.SetConversationEffort]'s terms: the caller says the new word in the
// very next statement, and the engine's own push is still on the wire.
