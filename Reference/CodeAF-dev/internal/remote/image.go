// image.go is the one payload that cannot simply be handed on. Every other
// argument on this wire means the same thing on both machines; a picture's PATH
// does not. The surface read it off its own disk, and the engine has no such
// disk, so the bytes travel and the path is REMADE HERE.
//
// It matters because of a law in internal/session's image.go: a journal holds a
// REFERENCE to a picture and never the bytes, so that a transcript stays
// readable and a resumed session is not re-sending base64 forever. A reference
// is only worth writing if it names a file that exists on the machine that
// wrote it — so the engine writes the picture down before it submits it, and
// what lands in the journal is a path a person on THIS machine can open.

// delete them, and two packages with two opinions about that folder is how the
