// held.go is the WAITING ROOM: the questions a conversation raised while nobody
// was attached to it, kept so that the next surface to arrive is handed them
// instead of never hearing them at all.
//
// It exists because version 2 separated a conversation's life from a
// connection's. A card is a question the turn STOPS on — consent.go blocks the
// call, the standing lane waits for an answer that never times out, a harness
// offer holds the turn before its first request — so a card raised into an
// empty room used to be a turn that sat there until something else killed it.
// That single fact is what made half the --host gap list honest: a lane whose
// answer could not arrive was better left off the belt entirely than present
// and hanging. With a persistent engine the room is no longer empty, it is
// merely unattended, and the difference is this file.
//
// WHAT IS HELD IS EVERY QUESTION THAT ARRIVES ON A TURN'S STREAM AND CAN BE
// ANSWERED OVER THIS WIRE. The four kinds below are four of the resolve-doors
// [WrappedAgent] carries. The harness lane's two cards — a design, a subharness
// intake — are deliberately absent: they never travel a stream, and the session
// replays whichever of them is still standing onto every new subscription
// (standinglane.go), so remembering them here would hand one question over
// twice.

// EVERY CARD IS TRACKED, AND WAITING IS A FACT ABOUT A SURFACE RATHER THAN
// ABOUT THE ROOM. A card is waiting for the window in front of you when that
// window has never been sent it: the surfaces the frame actually went to are
// remembered on the card, and every other surface — including one that dialled
// a second ago — is owed it. Handing it to the surface that already drew it
// would draw the same question twice, and that is the only case being excluded.
//
// THIS IS DELIBERATELY NOT "IS ANYBODY ATTACHED". A terminal that was killed is
// still in the room until its socket reports the end, which is a scheduling
// delay away and not a fact anybody can wait for; a welcome that asked whether
// the room was empty would tell the window that just replaced that terminal
// there was nothing to answer. Asking what THIS surface has seen is a question
// the answer to which cannot be late.
//
// It is NOT independently locked. Every door below is called with the owning
// [Session]'s mutex held, because every one of them is part of a larger
// decision that mutex already guards — "record this event and say who is
// watching", "let this surface in and tell it what is outstanding". A second
// lock here would only be a second order to get wrong.

// A DOOR-KEYED CLEAR MISSES EVERY NEW DOOR, which is the defect class this

// line in MethodConsent, one in MethodStandingResolve, one in MethodConnectKey —
// so the day the surface started answering every lane through the ONE door
// [MethodQuestionResolve] (the questions wave), nothing dropped anything. The
// owner answered a standing proposal, the engine recorded it once, and the same
// card came back on every attach: a tab switch, a conversation switch, a second
// window — each a new arrival number, each handed the answered card again by
// [heldSet.waitingFor], with [heldSet.outstanding] still counting it so the
// conversation read `waiting · your call` and home counted it in `want you`
// (2026-09-11, reported by the owner).
//
// So the room is reconciled against the QUESTION'S OWN LIFE instead
// ([session.Agent.OpenQuestions] is the whole of it — raised through one door,
// answered or withdrawn through one door), and there is nothing left for a new
// resolve-door to forget to call. It also subsumes what settleConnect did by
// hand: a connect ask whose five-minute wait ran out is a question the engine
// no longer has open, and so is one that was answered.
//
// IT IS NOT A PURE MIRROR OF THAT LIST and cannot become one. What a surface is
// handed on arrival is the lane's own FRAME — the EventConsentRequest, the

// not carry. This room keeps the frames; the engine says which of them still
