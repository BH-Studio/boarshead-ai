// file.go is image.go's law with the pictures taken out of it.
//
// image.go remakes ONE payload on arrival, because a picture's path means
// nothing on the machine that did not read it off a disk. Every other thing a
// person drops into a chat — a log, a CSV, a PDF, a stack trace they saved —
// has exactly that problem and had no answer at all before version 2: the path
// was typed here and named nothing there.
//
// So this file states the general form of the same bargain, which wire.go's
// [SubmitFilesArgs] writes out in one sentence: WHAT A PERSON PUTS INTO THE
// CHAT IS THE SURFACE'S TO READ AND THE ENGINE'S TO KEEP. The bytes ride the
// message, the engine writes them where that session keeps such things, and
// what reaches the journal is a path that is true on the machine that owns the
// journal.
//
// AND THE MODEL IS TOLD THE PATH, NEVER THE CONTENTS. An attached file is a
// file and the session already has a `read` tool, so a 4MB CSV stays out of the
// context window until something actually wants a row of it. That is the one
// place this differs from a picture, and it differs because a picture has no
// tool that can open it — the bytes have to be IN the message or the model
// cannot look at them at all (attach.go in internal/tui3 states the same law
// from the surface's end).
//
// [server.fetchFile] is the same frame walked backwards, and it is the door
// version 1 did not have: a byte moving from the engine machine to the one the
// person is sitting at. THE REFUSAL ON THAT DOOR IS THE ENGINE'S TO MAKE — see
// [handOver] for what this session will hand over and what it will not.

// backslash is an ordinary character, does not. The engine refuses a path
