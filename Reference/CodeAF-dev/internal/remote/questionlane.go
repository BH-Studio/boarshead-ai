// questionlane.go is the surface's half of version 14's QUESTIONS LANE.
//
// A question is one decision handed to a person with its evidence attached
// (docs/design/questions/DESIGN.md), and internal/session speaks every one of
// them on a subscription that outlives the turn — [session.Agent.WatchQuestions]
// — which replays whatever is still open the moment a surface attaches. Until
// this file that subscription had no frame on this wire, and the consequence was
// not a degraded drawing but SILENCE: internal/tui3 asserts the questions half
// of its agent as one interface (its questionAgent), a *Agent carried
// ResolveQuestion and neither of the other two doors, so the assertion failed,
// app.questionDoors() was false, and an `ask` on the road a plain `codeaf`
// takes stopped the turn with no block, no chip and no row on any screen. The
// answer's own door had been here all along, carrying [session.Answer] whole,
// which is exactly why nobody noticed: the half a person presses worked and the
// half that puts the question in front of them did not exist.
//
// IT IS clientlanes.go's FOUR PIECES, and it has them for that file's reason —
// fold a frame into the lane, end the lane when the connection does, hand out a
// fresh subscription per conversation, and answer what the lane raises. The
// answering door is [Agent.ResolveQuestion] and was already written.
//
// ── WHY [Agent.OpenQuestions] IS A REPLICA AND NOT A CALL ────────────────────
//
// The engine already states this fact unasked. Every question that is raised,
// withdrawn or answered crosses as a frame, and everything still open is
// replayed onto each new subscription — so a surface holding the lane has been
// TOLD what is open, and a call asking the same thing would be the round trip
// version 4 turned this protocol around to stop making (wire.go: intent goes up,
// facts come down). The replica is moved on the reader goroutine, before the
// event reaches the surface, so the list and the block a person is looking at
// cannot disagree.
//
// AND IT IS NOT A SECOND STORE, on the terms internal/session's question.go
// states that law: the engine derives its answer from the lanes' own waits,
// this end holds only what the engine SAID, and a link that ends throws the
// whole of it away rather than keeping a row nothing can take back off
// ([Client.buryLanes]).
