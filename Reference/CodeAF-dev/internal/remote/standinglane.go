// standinglane.go carries the HARNESS LANE across a connection: the design
// card, the notes around it, and the subharness intake card that shares the
// subscription.
//
// WHY IT IS HERE. Those cards are raised on a subscription the session keeps for
// the whole conversation (internal/session's emitHarness) and never on a turn's
// stream, so before this file a hosted conversation was built with its designer
// nilled and its intake cards off — a card raised over a wire was work nobody
// would ever be shown.
//
// WHAT MAKES A DETACHED CARD SURVIVE is not this file: internal/session replays
// whatever is still standing onto each new subscription, and the engine opens a
// fresh subscription for every window that asks. So a card raised into an empty
// room reaches the next window, and an answered one does not. These cards are
// deliberately NOT also in the waiting room (held.go) — they would then be
// handed over twice.
//
// IT IS tasklane.go's SHAPE: one subscription per surface that asks, one frame
// per event, no call on a repaint, and a pump that keeps draining after it goes
// quiet so no goroutine is parked on a channel. The task rail is not rewritten
// onto this — it predates the lane and is tested as it stands.
//
// AND IT IS THE SHAPE EVERY STANDING LANE SINCE HAS TAKEN. The conversation's
// name rides it (version 12) and so do its QUESTIONS (version 14): each is a
// subscription internal/session keeps for the whole session, each replays what
// is still true onto a surface that has only just attached, and each was a
// capability that simply did not exist over a connection until its two lines
// were added to the two maps below.
