// ── ONE MECHANISM: WORK THAT KEEPS ITS ORDER AND LEAVES THE READER ──────────
//
// orderedLane runs handed-in work ON ONE GOROUTINE, IN THE ORDER IT ARRIVED,
// and never makes the hand-in wait. Those three properties together are the
// whole of what the engine's reader goroutine was providing by running calls
// itself — and the fourth thing it was providing, accidentally, was a socket
// that stopped being read for as long as the work took.
//
// THE HAND-IN NEVER BLOCKS AND THE QUEUE IS NOT CAPPED, which is a deliberate
// choice and not an oversight. Every frame on this queue is a call the far end
// is waiting for synchronously, under its own [callDeadline]; a surface that is
// waiting for an answer does not send another. So the depth of this queue is
// the number of calls ONE surface has outstanding — a handful — and it is
// bounded by that surface's own patience rather than by a number invented here.
// A cap would have to be such a number, and the first thing it would do on the
// day it was reached is stop reading the socket, which is the defect this type
// exists to remove.
//
// THAT INVARIANT IS A LAW AND NOT A HOPE. [Client.notify] is the one mechanism
// on this wire that writes a frame nobody waits for, and one line of it naming
// an ordered method would turn the bound above into nothing;
// [TestEveryNotifiedMethodOwesNobodyAnOrder] refuses exactly that. Two smaller
// things the depth argument rests on, said out loud because a reader will ask:
// a surface whose call reaches [callDeadline] is free to send another, so the
// true bound is its outstanding calls plus one per deadline per goroutine — which
// is what "bounded by that surface's own patience" means; and after a long
// ordered call the lane replays ordered calls nobody is waiting for any more,
// which is what the socket buffer did before this type existed and is therefore
// the same behaviour rather than a new one. [MethodCompact], the longest there
// was, no longer rides here (callclass.go's [classWork]).
//
// It is a type rather than a channel and a goroutine written inline because
// "run these in the order they came, off the goroutine that received them" is a
// shape, and a shape spelled out twice is two shapes that will disagree.
