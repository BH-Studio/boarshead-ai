// driver.go is THE ROOM'S ONE KEYBOARD.
//
// Several surfaces have been able to attach to one conversation since version 2
// — that is what makes a desk and a phone one room — and until version 4 every
// one of them could type. There was no lock and no notion of who was driving:
// two windows both submitted, and the only arbiter was the session's own "a turn
// is already running" refusal, which is a sentence about the turn and says
// nothing at all about the other person.
//
// THE RULE IS THAT THE KEYBOARD FOLLOWS THE NEWEST WINDOW, AND NOTHING IS EVER
// THROWN AWAY. A person who walks to another machine and opens the conversation
// there is not an intruder to be refused, and the window they left behind is not
// rubbish to be closed — it is still showing the work, which is a feature. So:
//
//   - A NEW surface takes the keyboard on arrival. The older ones stay attached
//     and keep receiving every event live; they simply stop being the one that
//     can type, and their screens say so and say how to take it back.
//   - A RETURNING surface ([Hello.Back]) takes it only if it is going spare.
//     A redial is an attach the person did not make — a lid closed in one city
//     reconnecting half an hour later — and it must not pull the keyboard off
//     the machine they are actually sitting at.
//   - [MethodTake] moves it, in one round trip, to whoever asked.
//   - A DETACH hands it to the newest surface still in the room, so the last
//     window standing can always type.
//
// AND THE ENGINE IS THE ONLY THING THAT DECIDES. Every surface learns who drives
// from a frame the engine sent ([Driver]), a Submit from a surface that is not
// the driver is REFUSED WITH A SENTENCE rather than dropped, and there is
// exactly one driver per conversation at any instant because there is exactly
// one field. A surface that decided locally would be a second authority on a
// fact that can only have one, and the failure mode is two windows both
// believing they hold the keyboard and both being half right.

// methods that mutate a conversation without typing into it are numerous and
// keep arriving — a model, an effort rung, a permission, a resolve, a revive, a
// start, a stop, opening another session in this one, closing it — and a
// deny-list is a list somebody forgets to add to. This one refuses anything it
// has not heard of, so a method landing next year is read-only here by default
// and its author decides deliberately to add it.
//
// MethodDetach is on it because leaving on purpose is not a change to the
// conversation: it is the difference between a window closing and a pipe
// breaking, and a reader that could not say it would look like a crash.
//
// MethodPing is on it because it is the one call on this wire that is DEFINED as
// changing nothing: an empty frame out and an empty frame back, timed by the
// surface's own clock (wire.go says why the engine contributes no timestamp). A
// link that could not ask it would be a link that cannot measure itself, and the
// refusal would arrive as a fault on a connection that is working perfectly.
//
// AND THE QUESTIONS SUBSCRIPTION IS ON IT FOR THE SAME REASON, WITH ITS ANSWER
// DELIBERATELY LEFT OFF. A page reading somebody else's work is owed the fact
// that the work has STOPPED and is waiting on a person — a task room that drew
// `running` over a conversation sitting on a question would be the same lie the
// roster subscription was added to end. [MethodQuestionWatch] opens a standing
// read and changes nothing (questionlane.go). [MethodQuestionResolve] is not
// here and must not be: answering is exactly the kind of change this list
// refuses, and the window that owns the work owns the answer.
//
// AND THE TASK ROSTER SUBSCRIPTION IS ON IT BECAUSE THE OWNER'S GRAPH IS THE
// ONLY TRUTHFUL SOURCE FOR WHAT THE WORK IS DOING. [MethodTaskWatch] opens a
// standing read — the engine replays its roster and then pushes one frame per
// change (tasklane.go) — and it is what a reading page asks INSTEAD of guessing
// from files on the machine it happens to be running on
// (internal/tui3's taskowner.go).
//
// AND ONE TASK'S STORED PAGE IS ON IT BECAUSE A PROGRAM'S TASK HAS NO JOURNAL.
// senior-dev writes no worker transcript for [MethodTaskRoom] to read; what it
// did is its conversation with codeaf on the task's page in the plan store, so
// a reading page onto a program's task reads [MethodPlanTaskPage] instead
// (internal/tui3's [app.guestPageRead]). It opens the store's read handles and
// changes nothing. Every verb on that page — a note, a pause, a stop — is NOT
// here and must not be: they act on the work, which is the owner's.
