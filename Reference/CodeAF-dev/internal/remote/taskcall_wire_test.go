// THE REQUEST A NODE'S PHASE IS WAITING ON CROSSES THE LINK WITH THE PHASE.
//
// A hosted window reads a node's life off the standing task lane (tasklane.go),
// which carries every [session.Event] as JSON — so the live request a sizing
// reading is waiting on ([session.TaskPhaseNotice.Call]) reaches a `--host`
// rail and room by this wire and no other. A field that did not survive JSON
// would drop the whole frame (pumpTasks skips an event it cannot encode), and
// the far window would lose the phase along with the request. That is why the
// contract carries a request with no error on it, and this pins it.
