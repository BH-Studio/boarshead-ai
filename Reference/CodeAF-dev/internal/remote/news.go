// news.go is THE STATUS ROW, ACROSS A CONNECTION.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS FIXES. Bare `codeaf` in a workspace does not run the engine
// in the surface's own process: it dials the machine's engine host
// (internal/enginehost) and the surface talks to a [Agent] over a pipe. So the
// road every live figure on that surface travels — the rate at the right edge
// of the status row, the `via <machine>` rider beside the model on the seam,
// `connecting · 1.2s`, `first word …`, `thinking`, `writing`, and the `served`
// row `/status` prints — ran from internal/provider through internal/session's
// two process-global readers to internal/tui3, ENTIRELY INSIDE THE ENGINE'S
// PROCESS, and stopped there. The surface's code for all four was right the
// whole time. It was reading a desk nobody was writing to.
//
// So two more of the kinds that answer nothing (wire.go's [Frame.Kind]) carry
// them: "phase" for what the request in flight is doing, "lane" for the
// sighting a finished answer leaves behind.
//
// ── THE THREE THINGS THAT ARE NOT OBVIOUS ───────────────────────────────────
//
// ONE. THE READERS ARE GLOBAL AND THE HOST IS NOT. internal/session keeps one
// desk for the whole build, deliberately: a surface that draws a status line
// does not hold the agent that ran the errand behind it (lanenews.go says why).
// One process with one window needs nothing more. A HOST runs many
// conversations down many connections, so a single reader that fanned
// everything to everybody would draw every window's clock on every other
// window. Every piece of news therefore names its own conversation
// (internal/session's newskey.go) and the newsroom below files each connection
// under the same name.
//
// TWO. EVERY ROLE CROSSES AND THE SURFACE DECIDES. A task node's phases are
// drawn where a node is drawn and a conversation's on the status row, and that
// filter is already written on the surface (internal/tui3's phase.go, on
// [lane.Role]). Filtering here would be a second opinion about a question that
// already has one — and it is exactly what the in-process road does, which is
// the point: the same news reaches the same reader either way.
//
// THREE. NOTHING WAITS ON A SLOW PIPE. The fan-out runs on the stream's own
// goroutine, between two deltas — the budget internal/provider's postPhase is
// documented to keep — so a connection whose reader has stopped must not be
// able to hold up the turn it is measuring. Each surface gets an outbox with a
// floor under it and a goroutine of its own; when the outbox is full the frame
// is DROPPED. That is safe in a way a dropped event never would be: a phase is
// a claim about NOW and says itself again every second while it lasts
// (internal/provider's phaseBeat), and a sighting is redrawn by the next
// answer.
