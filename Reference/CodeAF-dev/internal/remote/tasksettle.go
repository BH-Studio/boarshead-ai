// tasksettle.go carries THE ANSWER TO A LANDING over the wire.
//
// A task that comes home with nobody able to say whether it holds is the
// person's call, and the card in front of them offers `[a] accept`, `[n] not
// right`, `[s] tell it` and the one-time hand-over (internal/tui3's
// tasksettle.go). Every one of those spends an engine door — ResolveUnverified,
// ResolveConflict, HandUnverifiedToModel, TakeBackDecision — and until this file
// existed NOT ONE OF THEM CROSSED. The surface asserts the doors on the agent it
// holds; a window attached to an engine host holds a *remote.Agent, the
// assertion answered no, and the absence law then did exactly what it is written
// to do: it drew the card with its reason and NO ANSWERS ROW AT ALL.
//
// THAT IS #706, AND THE PATH LENGTH IS WHY IT LOOKED LIKE A FIXTURE BUG. A host
// is only reachable where its socket path fits (internal/enginehost's
// socketLimit), so the same binary drew four chips for one seeded landing and
// none for another whose temporary home was a few characters shorter — the
// second had a host, the first had fallen back to the in-process engine.
//
// So the four verbs cross here, in the shape the rest of this wire uses: a door
// interface the host asserts on its own agent, a [Welcome] flag so a surface can
// tell an engine that has them from one that does not, and one argument type for
// all four.

// taskSettleDoor is the whole of what deciding a landing needs from an engine.
//
// IT IS ONE INTERFACE AND NOT FOUR because they are one capability: an engine
// that can take an accept can take a refusal, hand the question to its model and
// take it back again — they are four entry points into task_audit.go's single
// resolution path. The merge round is the one that could honestly be absent
// (internal/tui3's conflictAgent says why), and it is asserted separately at the
// far end rather than splitting the advertisement in two: a session agent has
// all four or none.

// [Welcome.Folders]'s stated reason for existing and applies here word for word.

// because the three acts that move a question are not resolutions and an engine
// that read the field first would take a hand-over as an accept.
//

// a round, and an engine can perfectly well settle a landing and have no such
// door — so it is refused by name rather than taking the whole method down with
// it (internal/tui3's conflictAgent keeps the same split at the other end).
