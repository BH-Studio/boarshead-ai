// ── TEAMS ACROSS THE WIRE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A team's file and its Traffic logs live in the profile of the machine the
// SESSION runs on, because the team tools a model calls (internal/session)
// read and write them there. Over --host the window is on the laptop and the
// session is on the far machine, so a window that kept teams in its own
// profile would draw a list the manager never reads and a rail that is an
// empty log drawn as the team's. These three doors let the window read and
// write the ENGINE's teams, answered from [Engine.ProfileDir].
//
// THEY ARE SHAPED FOR A CLOCK OVER SSH. The window asks about a managed team
// about once a second while it holds one of its conversations, and never at
// any other time. So every question carries what the window already has (the
// file's stamp, the log's cursor), and an answer about nothing new is a few
// bytes: `{"stamp":"…","same":true}` for the file and `{"stamp":"…"}` for a
// log. The engine stats before it reads ([teamstore.Watch]), so a quiet second
// costs it a stat per file too.
//
// THEY ARE ADDITIVE TO THIS VERSION, and [Welcome.Teams] is how a window knows
// they are there: an engine from before them sends no field, and the window
// turns teams off over that connection with the sentence it has always said
// rather than falling back to the laptop's file (internal/tui3's host.go).

// ── AND THE TWO ASKS THE WALL MAKES OF THE ENGINE'S MODEL ───────────────────
//
// A team's suggested name and Organize's proposals are one cheap call each on
// the naming role (internal/session's teamname.go and teampropose.go), made by
// the ENGINE because the model, its key and its bill are on the engine's
// machine. Over --host the wall is on the laptop, so without these two doors
// the default road never asked: the card kept the word it opened with and
// Organize showed the folder pass alone, in every terminal and in no test.
//
// THEY CARRY A BUDGET, NOT A DEADLINE, for [RefreshRunSummaryArgs.Budget]'s
// reason: the engine's clock is not this one's. The wall bounds each ask
// (internal/tui3's teamNameWait and organizeWait), and the engine bounds the
// model call by the same span so it stops when the wall stops listening.
//
// [Welcome.TeamAsk] says the engine answers them. An engine from before them
// sends no field, and this end refuses at once rather than spend a round trip
// on a refusal, which is exactly the failure the wall already turns into the
// word it holds and the folder pass alone.
