// The bug these pin: a conversation whose turn had ended but whose work had not
// read as idle. A task, an adaptive run and a background job outlive the turn
// that started them, and the ring is dropped when the stream closes — so the
// session went quiet on paper while the workers ran on, and the sweep closed it
// half an hour later with the work inside.
