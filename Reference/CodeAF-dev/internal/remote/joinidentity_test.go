// A JOIN GETS THE CONVERSATION IT NAMED, OR IT GETS A REFUSAL.
//
// [Hello.Join] is a hello about ONE conversation: a surface read a row off a
// disk, believes that work is running next door, and asks for a second view onto
// it. Two locks stand between the question and the answer — the host's, which
// finds the session under that transcript, and the session's, which lets the
// connection in — and the window between them is a real one. The window that
// owns the session can open something else in it right there, and until this the
// arriving connection was quietly bound to the REPLACEMENT: every guard after
// the door then compared that conversation against itself and passed, forever.
//
// The tests below stand in that window on purpose. `dialOpening` hands the test
// the door itself, so the swap happens where the host has already let go and the
// session has not yet been asked — no timing hook in the engine, and no sleep.
