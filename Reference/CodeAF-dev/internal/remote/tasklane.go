// tasklane.go is THE STANDING TASK LANE, ACROSS A CONNECTION.
//
// A task is a node in the conversation's graph, and its life — admitted,
// queued, running, done — is emitted on a subscription that outlives every
// turn (internal/session's [Agent.WatchTaskUpdates]). A local surface holds
// that subscription for the whole session and draws its rail from it.
//
// A HOSTED SURFACE HELD NOTHING, AND THAT WAS THE BUG. Version 6 gave the
// surface the task DOOR — it could commission work on the far machine — and no
// lane to watch it on. The engine's own emit puts every update on two lanes:
// the running turn's hub, and the standing subscription. Only the first crossed
// the wire, so the only task updates a hosted rail ever saw were the ones that
// happened to be raised inside a turn. `/task solo …` typed by hand raises none:
// the door is a call, not a turn, so the far worker ran to completion and the
// person who started it watched an empty column.
//
// The lane is per-SURFACE and not per-session, and that is the whole reason the
// roster arrives at all: [Agent.WatchTaskUpdates] replays the graph's rows onto
// each lane as it opens, so a window that attached an hour into the work learns
// every node rather than only the ones that moved after it arrived. One session
// with three windows on it opens three subscriptions and each gets its own
// replay, which is exactly what three local surfaces on one agent would do.
//
// IT IS OPENED ON DEMAND AND NEVER AT THE DOOR. The surface says
// [MethodTaskWatch] when it takes up a conversation, which is after its own
// half of the lane exists — so the roster replay cannot arrive before there is
// anything to draw it into. Saying it again replaces the subscription rather
// than adding a second, which is how `/new` over a connection gets a fresh
// roster for the conversation that replaced the old one.
//
// THE COST IS ONE SUBSCRIPTION PER WINDOW AND ONE FRAME PER EVENT. No call is
// made on a frame and none on a pointer (PERF.md's connection laws); the only
// call this file adds to a repaint is none.
