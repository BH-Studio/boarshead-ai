// THE NAME OF A SEND HAS TO CROSS THE WIRE, OR THE ONE FAILURE THAT MATTERS
// OVER A WIRE HAS NO ANSWER.
//
// The words cross, the engine takes them, and the answer is lost. Without a
// name on the send the surface can only send it again — a second correction on
// the worker's queue — or drop it. These are the four facts that make the third
// answer possible: the name travels, the repeat comes back recognised, an
// engine that does not keep names says so AT THE DOOR rather than after the
// damage, and a call nobody answered is told apart from a refusal.
