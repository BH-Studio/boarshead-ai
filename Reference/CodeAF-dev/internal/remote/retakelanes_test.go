//
// A turn's events survive a redial by themselves — they are numbered, the
// welcome says where this window got to, and the gap arrives as replay. The
// standing lanes are not numbered and are not replayed by the protocol: each is
// a subscription the engine hung on the CONNECTION, and the connection is what
// died. So a window whose link was repaired drew its transcript and its status
// line and looked entirely well while its rail never spoke again (#761).
