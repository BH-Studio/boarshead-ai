// A CAPTION'S FAMILY CROSSES THE LINK WITH ITS SENTENCE.
//
// The mark the far surface draws beside a step comes off
// [session.Event.Category] (the engine's actioncategory.go). A wire that carried
// the words and dropped the family would leave `--host` drawing the generic
// bucket for every step while the same work on the same machine drew the right
// one — the same screen, two answers, and nothing to say which.
//
// [EventWire] embeds the event whole, so this is a claim about the tag rather
// than about a copy: it passes for free and it is asserted anyway, because "for
// free" is precisely the kind of claim that stops being true in a refactor
// nobody thought touched this.

// The old frame is MADE by deleting the key from a current one rather than typed
// out as a literal, because a literal would have to spell EventCaption's ordinal
