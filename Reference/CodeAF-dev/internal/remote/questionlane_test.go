// The bug these pin, and it is the questions wave's headline: since the session
// host landed, a plain `codeaf` in a project is a SURFACE talking to this
// machine's engine over a unix socket — and this wire carried ResolveQuestion
// and neither WatchQuestions nor OpenQuestions. internal/tui3 asserts the three
// as one seam, so the assertion failed, no question was ever drawn, and every
// `ask` stopped the turn with nothing on any screen. They follow
// standinglane_test.go, which pinned the same fault in the harness lane.
