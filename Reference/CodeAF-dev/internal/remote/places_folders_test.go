// The defect these are written against is not a remote one at all. The ordinary
// `codeaf chat` on this laptop goes through this wire to this machine's own
// session host (cmd/codeaf's chatv3_local.go dials with an empty machine name),
// so the surface's folder picker was type-asserting a door onto a *remote.Agent
// that had none — and the assertion failing was, by design, silent: the line
// `folder · <path>` was drawn over a conversation that had gained nothing, and
// the session's own meta.json had no places on it afterwards.
//
// So the tests here are about the road: does the choosing reach the ENGINE'S
// agent, does its answer come back, does the set reach the surface without a
// round trip, and does an engine that cannot hold a folder say so instead of
// pretending.
