// browse_test.go drives the two read-only doors onto the engine's disk — the
// listing and the stat — plus the digest a fetch now carries, and it drives
// them over [Loopback] rather than by calling the handlers: these three are the
// first methods whose whole value is on the SURFACE's side of the wire (a
// browse page, a pathlink that only lights when the far machine says the word
// is real, a cache that skips a fetch it already holds), so the test asks the
// question the way that surface will ask it.
//
// What every case here is really about is one law said three ways: the two
// roots. A listing of a place outside them is refused, a link that leaves them
// is described and never followed, and a path outside them is reported as not
// being there at all.
