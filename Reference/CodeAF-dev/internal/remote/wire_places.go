// ── THE THREE PLACES THAT COULD NOT CROSS ───────────────────────────────────
//
// [MethodPlacesWorld] answered five of the surface's seven places out of one
// walk, and stopped there because the other three are not that walk: spend adds
// up an append-only LEDGER, search asks a full-text INDEX a question, and memory
// reads — and WRITES — a store of what the machine has learned. None of those is
// a listing of the projects root, so none of them could ride the world door, and
// each one drew a dim sentence in place of its rows (internal/tui3's host.go).
//
// These are their doors. They are additive to version 4, which is deliberate and
// is the whole reason they are shaped this way: an engine that predates them
// answers `engine: no such method` (server.go's fallthrough), the surface reads
// that as the reading being absent HERE, and the place says the sentence it has
// always said instead of hanging on a call nobody will answer. Nothing about the
// old wire moved, so a new surface against an old engine is exactly the program
// that shipped, and an old surface against a new engine never asks.
//
// ONE METHOD PER READING, which is the law [MethodPlacesWorld] already states:
// a single door answering everything would tie a page that wants the ledger on a
// three-second beat to a full-text search nobody typed.
const (
	// MethodPlacesLedger is the spend place's reading of THE ENGINE MACHINE'S
	// usage ledger, and it is BOUNDED BY A FLOOR because the ledger is a file
	// that grows by a line per model call, forever.
	//
	// A DOOR THAT ANSWERED THE WHOLE LEDGER WOULD CARRY A YEAR OF A BUSY
	// MACHINE'S ROWS ACROSS AN SSH PIPE TO DRAW A FORTNIGHT. So the surface says
	// how far back it is looking and the engine answers only that far back — and
	// on the beat after, the surface asks from the newest instant it already
	// holds, so the second call and every call after it carries the handful of
	// lines written since. That is [session.UsageCache]'s own tail-read law with
	// a wire in the middle of it (cmd/codeaf's [hostLedger]).
	MethodPlacesLedger = "Places.Ledger" // LedgerArgs → LedgerReading

	// MethodPlacesSearch is one full-text query over every message the ENGINE
	// machine has kept ([store.Store.SearchConversations]).
	//
	// THE SURFACE NO LONGER ASKS IT, and the engine keeps answering it anyway.
	// The Search place that sent this query was removed (#1650), so a current
	// surface never calls it; an older surface attached to a newer engine still
	// has that place, and this door is what keeps its box finding anything.
	// There is no cache behind it — a query is not a beat, it is an answer
	// somebody's enter key is waiting for.
	MethodPlacesSearch  = "Places.Search"  // SearchArgs → []store.ConversationHit
	MethodPlacesArchive = "Places.Archive" // ArchiveArgs → nothing

	// ── the folders a person attaches ───────────────────────────────────────
	//
	// THE PATH IS THE ENGINE MACHINE'S AND WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE. A folder
	// attached to a conversation is a folder the WORK can reach, and the work
	// runs where the engine runs — so these two doors carry a path and the far
	// end is the one that stats it, snaps it to its repository root and writes
	// it down. That is not a concession to the remote case: the ordinary local
	// launch goes through this same wire to this machine's own session host
	// (cmd/codeaf's chatv3_local.go), and before these methods existed the
	// surface's picker asserted a door onto the agent, found a wire client that
	// had none, and said `folder · <path>` over a conversation that had gained
	// nothing.
	//
	// THERE IS NO METHOD FOR READING THEM, and that absence is the design. The
	// set rides [session.Facts] and comes down unasked on every push
	// (replica.go), because the folder indicator is drawn on a frame and a frame
	// may not wait on a network. These two are INTENT — a person attaching, a
	// person removing — which is exactly what still goes up.
	MethodPlacesRefer = "Places.Refer" // ReferArgs → session.PlaceRef
	// MethodPlacesRemove takes one folder back off the conversation. It carries
	// the path and nothing else, and the engine refuses a path its conversation
	// is not about rather than answering a silent nothing.
	MethodPlacesRemove = "Places.Remove" // string (path) → nothing

	// ── the memory doors ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
	//
	// THE MEMORY PLACE IS THE ONLY PLACE ON THIS SURFACE THAT WRITES, and that is
	// why there are seven of these rather than one reading. A place that listed
	// the far machine's memories and edited this one's would be worse than a
	// place that crossed nothing at all: every row on it would be true and every
	// key on it would land somewhere else. So the whole seam crosses, readings
	// and writes together, and an engine that cannot answer one of them cannot
	// answer any of them — the door is the store, and the store is nil or it is
	// not (server.go's [Engine.Memory]).
	//
	// The names are the SURFACE's names for these readings and not the store's,
	// because the surface's seam is what this wire exists to fill; cmd/codeaf
	// already owns that translation in one place ([v3Brain]).

	// MethodMemorySnapshot is everything remembered on the engine machine,
	// shelved and counted, in the two statements the place draws from.
	MethodMemorySnapshot = "Memory.Snapshot" // int (row cap) → store.MemoryShelves
	// MethodMemoryChanged is how many memories were learned and how many were
	// let go of since an instant — the two figures the memory tab's number is
	// made of. A zero instant answers zeros, which the store already promises.
	MethodMemoryChanged = "Memory.ChangedSince" // time.Time → MemoryChange
	// MethodMemoryList is the flat list behind `/memories` and behind the undo,
	// which has to re-read after a restore.
	MethodMemoryList = "Memory.List" // MemoryListArgs → []store.Memory
	// MethodMemoryUpdate is `e` on a line: the wording, fixed.
	MethodMemoryUpdate = "Memory.Update" // MemoryUpdateArgs → nothing
	// MethodMemoryForget is `f` on a line, and MethodMemoryRestore is the undo
	// that takes it back. Both carry the id and nothing else.
	MethodMemoryForget  = "Memory.Forget"  // string (id) → nothing
	MethodMemoryRestore = "Memory.Restore" // string (id) → nothing
	// These three are the transcript commands, which operate on the session's
	// memory engine rather than the store editor behind the memory place.
	MethodMemoryRemember    = "Memory.Remember"    // string → title
	MethodMemoryForgetQuery = "Memory.ForgetQuery" // string → title
	MethodMemoryMemories    = "Memory.Memories"    // string → []session.MemoryLine
