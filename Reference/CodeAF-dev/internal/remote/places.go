// ── THE ENGINE HALF OF THE THREE LATE PLACES, AND THE SURFACE HALF ──────────
//
// wire_places.go says what these doors are and why they are additive; this is
// what answers them and what asks them. They are in a file of their own rather
// than in server.go's switch and client.go's run of methods for one reason that
// is about people and not about code: every lane of the host-parity wave edits
// those two files, and nine methods threaded through both of them is nine
// conflicts for whoever merges.
//
// EVERY DOOR HERE REFUSES RATHER THAN INVENTS. A nil closure is a capability
// this engine does not have — memory turned off, a build with no index, a world
// with no ledger — and it is answered as an error so that the surface can tell
// "there is nothing there" from "nobody asked". That is [Engine.World]'s own
// law, restated once here and not per method.

// engineOffWord leads every refusal in this file. It names the MACHINE and not
// the connection, because that is the fact the surface turns into a sentence: a
// person reading `memory is off on that machine` has learned something true
// about the far end, where `memory is off for this session` would have been a
// claim about a setting nobody consulted (internal/tui3's host.go).
