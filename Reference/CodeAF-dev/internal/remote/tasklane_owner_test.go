// A STANDING RAIL BELONGS TO THE CONVERSATION IT WAS OPENED ON.
//
// [Session.serving] closed the wrong-owner hole for CALLS: a joined reader
// asking about task 7 after the owner opened something else is refused rather
// than answered by the replacement's task 7. The standing lane had the same hole
// and no such guard, and it was worse in two ways — nobody asks for the frames,
// and [Session.retakeTaskLanes] reopens every subscribed surface on the
// replacement agent by itself. So a guest sat there being pushed another
// conversation's rows, under the name of the one it joined, with no call
// anywhere to be refused.
//
// The task ids below are 7 in BOTH conversations on purpose. That collision is
// the whole failure: the rows are indistinguishable on the wire, and the only
// thing that can tell them apart is which conversation the lane was opened on.
