// Package cachedir owns the one directory under codeaf's state root that holds
// nothing but caches: ~/.codeaf/cache, where every task worker's toolchain
// caches live (internal/exec's sweCacheRoot puts go-mod, go-build, cargo, npm
// and pip under it).
//
// The package exists so that "delete the cache" is one verb with one blast
// radius, written down once. Everything in this directory is re-downloadable by
// construction — a module cache is content-addressed, a build cache is derived —
// so deleting it costs cold builds and nothing else. What it must NEVER touch
// is everything beside it under the state root: the journal, the CAS, the v3
// session files, the config and the credentials are a person's own things, and
// a "cache clean" that reached them would be data loss wearing a janitor's
// name. Both surfaces that offer the verb — `codeaf cache clean` and the chat's
// /cache clean — call in here rather than spelling a path of their own, so the
// radius cannot drift between them.
