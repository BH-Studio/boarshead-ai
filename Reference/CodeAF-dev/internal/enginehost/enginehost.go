// Package enginehost is the process that keeps a conversation alive between
// connections.
//
// `codeaf chat --host devbox` runs `ssh devbox codeaf engine` and speaks
// internal/remote's protocol over the pipes. In version 1 that process WAS the
// conversation: it opened the session, answered frames, and died with the pipe,
// so a closed laptop lid and a dropped wifi both ended a running turn. This
// package is the other half of version 2's answer — a host that outlives the
// pipe, holding the engine, while `codeaf engine` becomes a splice between the
// ssh pipes and a unix socket.
//
// ── THE GRAIN IS ONE HOST PER WORKSPACE, AND THE CHDIR LAW DECIDES IT ────────
//
// A host holds one engine per open session, but every session it holds is about
// the SAME directory, and that is not an arbitrary carving. `codeaf engine`
// moves the process into the workspace before it assembles anything (cmd/codeaf
// engine.go), and that chdir is the only chdir in the tree — the process's own
// idea of where it is has to agree with the session config's. A host holding
// two workspaces would have to break that or lie about it. So the socket lives
// under a directory named for the workspace, a host is born in it, and a hello
// asking for a different one reaches a different host through a different
// socket. Nothing about the protocol changes; the routing happens before the
// first frame.
//
// ── NOTHING HERE IS REQUIRED ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE FALLBACK IS NOT OPTIONAL. A machine where the socket directory cannot be
// made, where the path is too long for a unix socket, where the lock cannot be
// taken, or where the host simply refuses to start must still take a remote
// session — as the version-1 engine did, on the pipe, with the welcome saying
// [remote.Welcome.Persistent] is false. Every door in this package is written
// to be allowed to fail: the caller reads the error as "not today" and serves
// the connection itself.
