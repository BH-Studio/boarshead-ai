// stale_test.go is the half of this package that keeps a rebuild from trapping
// somebody: a host that can be asked which build it is, that goes when it is
// holding nothing, that stays when it is holding work, and that lets itself go
// once the file it was started from has been replaced under it.
//
// These stand a REAL host on a REAL unix socket, which is why they go through
// [shortHome] — a socket path has about a hundred bytes to spend and a Mac's
// TMPDIR eats most of them before the test has said anything, so the home is
// made under /tmp directly and never under whatever TMPDIR happens to be.
