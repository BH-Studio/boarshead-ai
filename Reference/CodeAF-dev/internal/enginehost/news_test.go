package enginehost

// news_test.go is the one question this package owns about the live status row:
// A HOST RUNS MANY CONVERSATIONS AND THE READERS THAT MEASURE THEM ARE
// PROCESS-GLOBAL.
//
// internal/session keeps one phase desk and one lane desk for the whole build,
// deliberately (its lanenews.go says why), and one process with one window
// needs nothing more. A host is the build where that stops being enough:
// several conversations, several connections, and one reader for all of them.
// A piece of news that could not name its own conversation would be drawn on
// every window at once — somebody else's clock, somebody else's machine, under
// an answer this person is waiting for.
//
// THE FRAMES ARE READ RAW AND NOT THROUGH A CLIENT. internal/remote's client
// puts what it receives straight onto THIS process's own desk, which is exactly
// right in a surface and useless in a test that has to say which of two
// connections a frame went down. So each surface here is a pipe and a scanner.
