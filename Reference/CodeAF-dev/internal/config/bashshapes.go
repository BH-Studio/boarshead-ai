// THE SHAPE AN "ALWAYS" IS BANKED AS.
//
// A person who presses always on `git status --short` is not saying that one
// string of characters and nothing else; they are saying they are done being
// asked about git status. The card used to write the line down verbatim
// (approvalmemory.go's [RememberBashApproval]), which meant the next call —
// `git status --porcelain`, the same work with one more flag — asked again, and
// the always they pressed bought them one keystroke exactly once. A rule that
// answers only the line it was written for is a rule nobody presses twice.
//
// So the card offers SHAPES, and this file derives them. Three laws.
//
//   - THE SHAPES COME FROM THE LINE AND ARE SHOWN BEFORE THEY ARE WRITTEN. This
//     is a deriver, not an inference: it proposes, the person picks, and what
//     they picked is what is written. Nothing here widens anything on its own.
//   - THE LINE ITSELF IS ALWAYS ON OFFER, and it is always last. It is the
//     narrowest thing that can be written down and the one that needs no
//     thought, so it is the answer somebody reaches for when none of the wider
//     ones is what they meant.
//   - A SHAPE THAT PINS NOTHING DOWN IS NOT OFFERED AT ALL ([bashShapeHolds]).
//     A bare `*` is not an approval, it is the end of the question; and a shape
//     whose only word is sudo says the person approved elevation rather than a
//     command. Neither is a thing anybody means to press a letter for.

// order the card offers them: the command's own words first, then the program

// anyway, because it is the shape a person pressing always on git status
// usually means, and the widest reading of what they did is the one that has to
// be read carefully rather than the one that is offered first. The LINE is last
// for the reason the head of this file gives.
//
// A COMPOUND LINE DERIVES NOTHING. An allow rule vouches only for a command it
// matches whole (internal/approval's bash.go), so every shape drawn off
// `cd /tmp && rm -rf build` would be a rule that cannot fire, and offering one
// would be offering somebody a choice between three things that do nothing.
