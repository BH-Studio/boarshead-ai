// prefix of a model id, so the id is persistence vocabulary and the Written
// name is what a person's model ids carry. Nothing here may conflate them.

// PrepareCustomSource is the one door that mints a custom connection's
// persisted row, and both doors onto a connection (/connect and the Providers
// tab) call it before ConnectService, which stays the one validate, probe and
// persist path. written is the name the person gave or empty for the default

// The blank-model and empty-set guards are the only logic here; everything
// else is [Set.For], which answers with the default service when no connected

// of a model id, so a connection renamed from homelab to lab leaves every
// homelab/... id answering on a service that no longer exists, resolving to no
// service and handing itself to the default one: a silent misroute that only
// fails at send.
//
// THE NAME IS THE ONLY THING THAT MOVES, IN ONE WRITE. The id is re-spelled
// under the new prefix — the SAME model, spelled the new way — and nothing else
// about a row is touched; every re-prefixed value passes the tier gate
// ([ValidateTierValue]) and the whole decision lands through one
// [writeProfileValues], so a failure leaves the profile byte-identical. A tier
// row that was never held stays never held: writing one would convert an
// inherited tier into a pinned one. Only a row whose value actually changes is
// written.
