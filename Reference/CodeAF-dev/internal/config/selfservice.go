// THE SELF-SERVICE LAW: A SETTING THAT EXISTS TO RESTRAIN THE MODEL IS NOT THE
// MODEL'S TO CHANGE.
//
// The chat can change a person's settings for them — "use deepseek for
// planning", "stop drawing timestamps" — through a belt tool that is a door onto
// this registry (internal/session's tools_settings.go). That door needs one
// thing this file gives it: a list of the rows it must refuse.
//
// The reasoning is the plainest there is. Some of these rows exist for no other
// purpose than to stand between the model and something the person wanted to be
// asked about first — the tool gate, the shell rules, the day's budget, the
// auditor that checks a node's work before it merges. A model that can widen its
// own restraints has none, and it does not have to be malicious to do it: a
// model asked to "make the tests stop nagging me" will reach for the approval
// mode because it is the shortest road, and the person who asked will have lost
// the gate without ever deciding to.
//
// So the list lives HERE, beside the rows it names, rather than in the package
// that holds the tool. A row is declared once in [Settings.build], and who may
// turn it is a fact about the row rather than a fact about one caller — a second
// copy in a tool file would be a list that goes stale the first time a rail is
// added, and a rail nobody guarded is a rail that guards nothing.
//
// ERR TOWARD REFUSING. A row wrongly refused costs the person eight keystrokes
// in /settings. A row wrongly allowed costs them the thing the row was for.

// The reasons a row is refused, each naming the KIND of restraint rather than
// the row. They are grouped this way because the person reading a refusal wants
// to know what they are being protected from, and "spending" said once about six
// rails is a sentence somebody can hold; six bespoke sentences are six things to
// read and no rule to learn.
