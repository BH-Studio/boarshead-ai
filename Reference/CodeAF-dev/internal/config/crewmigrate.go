// A PROFILE WRITTEN BEFORE THE CREW WAS ROUTED, READ THE WAY ITS OWNER MEANT IT.
//
// Until 2026-09-24 a crew was a preset word — frugal, balanced, max — that
// wrote all five tier rows at once, a family row (`open` or `all`) saying
// which shelf the word drew from, a pick row (`table`, `catalog`, `learn`)
// saying where unwritten seats were computed from, and a tier row could say
// `auto` to be computed. None of those words means anything now: every seat
// nobody pinned is routed per task. So a profile carrying them is read like
// this, and migrated once, with one line saying so:
//
//   - the preset word, the pick word and an `auto` row are read as AUTO;
//   - the family row's `open` becomes the allowed-models rule `open`, because
//     it said which models the person would accept, which is exactly what that
//     rule says now; `all` is the default and needs no row;
//   - a seat row holding ANY model id is A PIN — even one a retired preset
//     once wrote, and even three rows holding the same id. There is no telling
//     from a row which hand wrote it, and a pick never overrides a model id
//     that may have been a person's: the rule the old picker kept, kept.
//
// The reading is applied on every read until the migration writes it down
// ([MigrateCrew]), so a build that has not yet migrated a profile still runs
// the crew its owner meant.

// The retired rows, spelled here and nowhere else.
