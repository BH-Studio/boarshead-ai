// ROUTE HEALTH — WHAT THIS INSTALL HAS LEARNED ABOUT EACH ROUTE.
//
// A route is a provider, a send id and a price, and a crew seat's first call on
// it either answers or fails with a kind of failure (internal/provider's
// RouteFailure: payment, auth, forbidden, quota, unavailable, transient). Those
// outcomes are written to the router's log as they happen ([LogCrewRoute]) and
// read back here, oldest first, into what every decision is routed around:
//
//   - forbidden   → the route is QUARANTINED for [crewQuarantineFor]: this route
//     will not take this model for this account, and asking again tomorrow
//     will not change that;
//   - quota       → the route COOLS DOWN until the reset it said, or for
//     [crewCooldownFor];
//   - unavailable → the route cools down, and the model is DEMOTED off
//     unpinned seats: it is not served there any more;
//   - payment     → every PAID route on that provider's account is
//     UNAFFORDABLE, until a paid call on it answers again;
//   - auth        → the provider is DISCONNECTED, until a call on it answers
//     again — or the person reconnects it;
//   - transient   → nothing but the route's failure rate.
//
// Every outcome feeds the route's learned chance of refusing a first call,
// which is part of what the route is expected to cost (crewroute's routeCost).
// NOTHING HERE NAMES A PROVIDER: the kinds are the provider layer's, and a
// provider that says its credit is gone before a call is made can say so
// through [CrewAccountState].
