// The conversation model, written down.
//
// Every other model slot on the sheet resolves from somewhere a later launch
// can read again — an environment variable, a row in this file — and the talk
// slot did not. It was a LIVE SEAM and only that: the picker swapped the model
// on the running agent, the sheet's row read it back off the same agent, and
// the next launch opened on CODEAF_MODEL or the built-in default as though
// nobody had chosen anything. A person who picked a model, worked in it for an
// hour and restarted found themselves back on a model they had deliberately
// left.
//
// So the choice lands here, and the v3 door reads it back before it opens
// (cmd/codeaf's chatv3.go). The whole rule is three lines below and the
// interesting one is that a SAVED CHOICE BEATS CODEAF_MODEL — which is the
// registry's own law for this row rather than a new one. The talk slot carries
// CODEAF_MODEL as an [Setting.EnvDefault] and not an [Setting.Env]: the
// variable seeds a value nobody has chosen and never freezes the row, so the
// sheet lets you change it while the variable is set. A launch that let the
// variable win would make that edit revert on the next start, silently, which
// is the same complaint this file exists to answer.

// KeyChatModel is where that choice is written in the profile's config.json.
//
// It is the SETTINGS ROW'S OWN KEY — [ModelSettingKey] for the talk slot —
// rather than a name of this file's invention, so if the registry ever persists
// its model rows itself the two halves land on one key instead of two. It is
// spelled as a constant because a key is a constant; [TestChatModelKeyIsTheRow]
// pins the two spellings together.

// ChatModelAt is the conversation model this profile last settled on, or empty

// the caller falls through to its own default, which is what an unconfigured
