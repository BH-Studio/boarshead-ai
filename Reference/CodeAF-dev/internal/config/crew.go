// THE CREW: THREE SEATS, EACH PINNED OR PICKED FOR THE TASK IN FRONT OF IT.
//
// A task is done by a crew of three — the worker that does it, the planner
// that cuts and steers it, the checker that reads the result against what was
// asked — and which model sits each seat is decided PER TASK by the router
// (internal/crewroute), from the kind of work the task is. Nothing about that
// decision is stored. What IS stored, and is the whole of what a person
// configures, is what the router may pick from:
//
//   - a PIN per seat, `model` or `model@provider`, which that seat always runs
//     and the router never overrides;
//   - the ALLOWED MODELS, one rule ([crewroute.ParseAllowed]) — `all` unless
//     somebody narrowed it;
//   - an optional DAILY CAP on what crews spend, which the router paces toward;
//   - the PROVIDERS TURNED OFF, a set of connections the crew may not route
//     through — empty unless somebody switched one off.
//
// The providers a crew can use are the connections the person made, read off
// the profile the way every call reads them; what persists is only which of
// them the crew leaves alone, so a connection made tomorrow is on the day it
// is made. That is the one-sentence model the whole feature is built on — the
// /crew panel says what is allowed and it persists; the words in an ask say
// how hard to try that one task; nothing else sticks.
//
// THE PINNED MODELS LIVE IN THE TIER ROWS THE CREW HAS ALWAYS LIVED IN. The worker
// seat is the `worker` tier row, the planner is the `mastermind` row, the
// checker is the `high` row — the rows the role ladder already reads, so the
// auxiliary calls that ride those tiers (the brief a task is shaped into, an
// image read for a model that cannot see one, the plan of an adaptive run)
// follow a pin. A named provider route lives beside that row, so an older
// build reading the tier still sends a model id. An unwritten row is `auto`:
// the seat is routed. The reflex and small-work rows are not crew seats and
// keep their shipped defaults.

// Crew rows, spelled once.
