// The models group, derived rather than written down.
//
// There used to be a slice here — nine slot words in a var, kept "identical" to
// the palette's by hand — and it drifted the way a copied list always does: it
// carried a row for a boost chord that is a second door onto the work binding
// (8.2.16 forbids exactly that), and it carried NO row for two of the five
// roles the router actually routes. A person opening the sheet was told about a
// slot the product does not treat as a slot, and was not told about the model
// two whole classes of call run on.
//
// So the list is gone. The roles come from [store.ModelRoles], which is the
// router's own table and the only place the five are declared; the capability
// slots come from [mediaModalities], which is the table [ModelCandidates]
// already answers candidacy from. Both are asserted in settings_test.go: a
// sixth role, or a sixth modality, becomes a row here without anyone editing
// this file, and a role whose plain word nobody wrote fails the build rather
// than reaching a reader as machinery.

// ModelSlot is one row of the models group: what it binds, what it is called in
// the product's language (14), and what it falls back to when it is unset.

	// Slot is the word the models door and [SettingsOptions.SetModel] take. For
	// the three roles the engine still holds a client for it is the legacy
	// engine word; for the other two it is the role itself.
	Slot string

	// Label is the plain word. Never the machinery name: nobody has an
	// "orchestrate model", they have a model that does the conversation.
	Label string

	// Role is the router role this row binds, empty for a capability slot.
	Role store.ModelRole

	// Follows names the row whose model this one uses while it is unset. It is
	// read as the row's empty reading, so an unset row says what will actually
	// run instead of showing a blank a reader would have to guess at.
	Follows string

	// Held says the running engine holds a client for this slot and can be
	// asked what it is on right now. The two roles nothing resolves yet are
	// not held, and asking the engine for them would get the conversation
	// model back — a wrong answer rendered as a confident one.
