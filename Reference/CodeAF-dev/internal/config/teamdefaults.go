// ── THE TEAMS GROUP: WHAT EVERY TEAM INHERITS WHEN IT SAYS NOTHING ─────────
//
// A team may override five things about how work is delegated to it
// (internal/teams' teamsettings.go): whether team traffic wakes its idle
// conversations, whether its members' questions go up to its manager first, what it may spend in a day, how deep teams may nest under
// it, and what share of its own cap a new sub-team is handed. A team that sets
// none of them inherits each from its parent, and the top of every chain
// inherits from these five rows. So these are DEFAULTS and nothing else: no
// session reads them to decide anything except through internal/teams'
// resolver, which reports beside every value where it came from, so a card can
// say `$5/day · from Settings` without guessing.
//
// THEY ARE FLAT KEYS UNDER `teams.`, because config.json is a flat dotted map
// ([readProfileConfig]); a nested `teams` object would read as unset with no
// error and every team would fall to the built-in default.

// The five rows' keys.
