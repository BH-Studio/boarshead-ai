// APPROVAL MEMORY: the "always" a person presses on a consent card, written
// down.
//
// internal/session's consent.go already remembers an "always" for the life of
// one agent, and says why that memo is not a setting: a session-scoped answer
// that survived the session would be a policy change nobody made. This file is
// the other half of that sentence — the place a person CAN make it, reached by
// a deliberate press on the card rather than by a background inference — and
// everything here exists to keep the two apart. The session's memo is memory;
// these two functions are a WRITE to the person's own config.json, into the
// same rows the settings sheet edits and the same rows they can undo there.
//
// Three laws hold the seam together.
//
//   - IT WRITES THE PERSON'S ROW AND NOTHING ELSE. Merging one entry into their
//     own tools.approval map does not touch the project layer's merge law
//     (projectconfig.go, law 2), which is about the two FILES: a repository's
//     row still replaces the person's WHOLESALE at launch. The honest
//     consequence, stated here because it is surprising: pressing always inside
//     a repository that answers tools.approval writes a preference that takes
//     effect everywhere EXCEPT that repository. Nothing else would be safe —
//     silently editing the repository's file would be this surface committing to
//     somebody's repository on their behalf, and quietly promoting the person's
//     row over it would break the one law that makes a checked-in rule set
//     readable.
//   - A MALFORMED EXISTING ROW IS REPORTED, NEVER CLOBBERED. A row that does not
//     parse is a rule set somebody wrote and believes is in force; rewriting it
//     from a parse that already failed would delete rules by accident. The write
//     refuses, and the surface that asked drops the refusal (consent.go).
//   - AN ALREADY-ANSWERED CALL IS NOT WRITTEN TWICE. Pressing always on the same
//     command in two sessions leaves one rule, because a row that grew a
//     duplicate every time would be a row nobody can read back.

// The action leads because it is the short, fixed half: a person scanning the
// row is looking for the word deny, and a command line is long enough to push it
// off the end of a line if it went first. The glob may be QUOTED in Go's own
// syntax, and has to be when it carries a comma, a newline or a quote of its own
// — a shell line contains anything, and a separator that a command can also
// contain is a row that reads back as two rules nobody wrote. Unquoted is

// here is `git status*` as readily as `git status --short`, and this function
// asks nothing about which of the two it was handed: a rule is a glob, and the
// person read the glob before they pressed the key. What it does ask is whether
// the glob is one worth writing down — [bashShapeHolds] — because a shape that
// pins nothing down is a row entry that answers for every command there is.
//
// Four refusals, and each of them is internal/approval's law rather than this
// file's caution:
//
//   - A COMPOUND SHAPE CANNOT BE REMEMBERED. An allow rule vouches only for a
//     single command it matches whole (bash.go's matching law), so a rule written
//     for `cd /tmp && rm -rf build` could never fire. Writing it anyway would put
//     a line in somebody's settings that says they approved something and does
//     nothing at all.
//   - A SHAPE THAT NAMES NO COMMAND IS NOT A RULE, and neither is one whose only
//     word is sudo (bashshapes.go states both).
//   - A SHAPE THE ROW ALREADY ALLOWS IS NOT WRITTEN AGAIN, whether the rule that
//     allows it is this exact glob or a broader one somebody wrote by hand.
//   - A SHAPE THE ROW ALREADY DENIES OR ASKS ABOUT IS LEFT ALONE, and the caller
//     is told. First match wins, so an allow appended after a standing deny is a
//     rule that never runs; the standing rule is a decision the person made in
//     the settings sheet, and a keystroke on a card does not overturn it.
//
// A LINE IS STORED AS THE GLOB IT IS. The dialect has no escape for '*', so a
// command line containing one is remembered as a pattern with a wildcard in it —
// `ls *.go` approved is `ls *.go` allowed. That is the honest reading of the
// line the person saw and approved, it stays bounded to a single non-compound
// command, and the critical-command table still asks about the shapes that
// destroy a disk whatever this row says.
