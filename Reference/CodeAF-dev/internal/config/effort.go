// The install's own rung on the effort ladder, written down.
//
// It is the LAST scope the resolver consults and the one every other scope
// falls back to (internal/effort's Resolve), so it is the number that decides
// how hard this machine thinks about anything nobody has said anything specific
// about — a person's turn, and the work they hand out.
//
// It lands here, in the profile's config.json, for the reason the conversation
// model lands here (chatmodel.go): a choice a person makes once and expects to
// find again is a choice that has to survive the process. There is deliberately
// no environment variable for it. CODEAF_REASONING already exists and means
// something else — the v1 planning economy (config.go's Reasoning) — and a
// second variable spelled almost the same would be answered wrong by everyone
// who met it.

// KeyEffort is where the install's rung is written in the profile's config.json.
//
// It is spelled bare rather than under a `model.` or `task.` prefix because it
// is not about one slot or one kind of work: it is the default for all of them,
// which is exactly what the resolver's last rung means.
