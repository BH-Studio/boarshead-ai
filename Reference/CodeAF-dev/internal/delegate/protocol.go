// The records: one JSON object per line on the program's stdout, the types
// below read, everything else ignored (docs/design/delegate/PROTOCOL.md).
// Ignoring the rest is what makes the reader generic — a program's own records
// pass straight through — and it is also why a line that is not JSON at all is
// dropped and counted rather than failing the run: a program that printed one
// stray line has not stopped being one codeaf can run.
//
// THERE IS NO SPEND RECORD. Version 1 read a cumulative `spend` the program
// reported about itself; the model API (internal/provider/modelapi) meters
// every call the program makes as it is made, so money has one source of truth
// and it is not the program's word. A `spend` line a program still writes is
// one more line this reader does not know, ignored and counted like any other.
//
// VERSION 2 IS INTERNAL. Both ends are compiled from this package into one
// binary, so the Go types here are the specification and the number in `hello`
// guards the one case where the two ends can still differ: an engine that
// outlived a rebuild starting the NEW binary as its child.
