// The conversation log: one record per model call a program makes through its
// model API, kept in the task's own record folder beside the trajectory. The
// API writes it (internal/provider) and the task page reads it
// (internal/session), and neither may import the other, so the record and the
// one door each side uses live here.
//
// THIS IS WHAT MAKES A PROGRAM'S WORK VISIBLE. To the program the API is an
// ordinary model backend; to codeaf the program is a very particular person
// asking it things. Every exchange is therefore a turn — what the program sent
// that it had not sent before, and what the model answered — and the page
// draws the turns as the conversation they are.
