// Package delegate is what codeaf needs of the programs it carries and can hand
// a whole task to — senior-dev first (docs/design/delegate/PROTOCOL.md): what
// one IS (a Go value in the build's list, internal/delegate/builtin), the
// command line every one of them answers (`codeaf <name> …`), the records a
// running one writes on its stdout and the one reader over them, the model API
// that is its only road to a model, the log of the conversation it holds over
// that road, and the launch of it as a child process that streams, stops on
// SIGTERM and ends with one terminal record.
//
// "DELEGATE" IS A WORKING TITLE. Everything a person reads names the program
// itself — `/senior-dev`, `codeaf senior-dev`, its own manual page — and only
// code says delegate, where a later rename is one package move.
//
// A PROGRAM CODEAF CARRIES IS STILL A PROGRAM APART. It is compiled into this
// binary, but it runs as a child process of it (`codeaf <name> run --json …`),
// so a crash in its engine cannot take the chat down, and it reaches a model
// only through the API codeaf serves it for that one run, so it never holds a
// key. What runs one AS A WORKER of a run — the live step, the trajectory, the
// spend bank — is internal/run's; nothing here knows what a task is.
//
// THIS PACKAGE IS A LEAF ON PURPOSE. The session door lists the programs and
// checks a name; the run engine seats one; the command line runs one; none of
// them may import the others, so what they share lives here and imports none
// of them.
