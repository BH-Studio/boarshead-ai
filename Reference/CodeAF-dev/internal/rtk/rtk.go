// Package rtk puts a compressor between a leaf's shell and the work model's
// context. rtk (github.com/rtk-ai/rtk, Apache-2.0) is a proxy binary that runs
// an inspection command and prints a far shorter version of what it said: a
// `ps aux` that cost 254KB of context costs 3.5KB through it, a `git diff` 41%
// less, a bare `ls -la` a fifth. Every one of those bytes is paid for again on
// every later turn of the leaf, so the saving compounds the way spilling does.
//
// Two properties are load-bearing, and everything in this package serves them.
//
// codeaf stays the only thing anyone installs. rtk is never a build or install
// dependency: it is resolved at runtime, and fetched in the background if it
// is missing. While it is unavailable — offline, unsupported platform,
// download still in flight — commands run exactly as they did before. Nothing
// here may block or fail a leaf's work.
//
// A leaf's shell never changes meaning because rtk was in the middle. rtk's own
// rewriter decides what it can compress, which is the honest source of truth
// and spares us a table of command syntax; but it is broader than we want — it
// will turn `git add .` into `rtk git add .` — so the last word on eligibility
// is here, and a wrapped run that goes wrong is answered by the plain one.
//
// The head's belt deliberately does not use any of this. The head reads
// deliverables in order to answer the user in their own words; a compressed
// read would cost answer fidelity to save tokens on the one surface where the
// bytes are the point.
