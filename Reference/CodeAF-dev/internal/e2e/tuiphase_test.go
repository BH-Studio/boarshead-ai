//go:build e2e

package e2e

// tuiphase_test.go is the phase clock on a real screen: what this build says
// while it is waiting on a machine, and what it offers to do about it.
//
// WHY THIS IS A GLIMPSE AND NOT A WAIT, which is the whole shape of the file.
// Both sentences are about a machine that has GONE QUIET — one pinned lane that
// stopped answering, or every reachable lane believed slow at once — and a real
// router cannot be asked for that. A subtest that waited twenty seconds for a
// stall would be a subtest that fails on a good day, which is the one kind of
// red nobody chases twice. So the turn is real, the screen is real, and the
// sentences are caught when the run is slow enough to say them and written down
// as a FINDING when it is not. That is exactly what the live strip's three
// words already do next door in tui_e2e_test.go, and for the same reason.
//
// AND WHAT IS CAUGHT IS READ WHOLE. A glimpse that only logged would be a
// waiter in name: the moment either sentence IS on the screen, this file
// asserts the rest of it — the offer's key, the report's second half — because
// a question drawn without the key that answers it is the defect the surface's
// own arm states a law about (internal/tui3's phase.go).
//
// The needles come through [say] out of tuiwords_test.go's table like every
// other string this package waits for, and the untagged gate beside it reads
// this file back — so a row that stops being asked for here is a row that gate
// names, on the pull request that stopped asking.

// TestTUIPhaseClock drives one real turn and watches the clock over it.

// It is its own top-level test rather than a tenth subtest of [TestTUIE2E]
// because it is the only scenario here that asks nothing of the product and
// only reads what the product says about the wire underneath it: it passes on a
// run where nothing ever went slow, which no other subtest in this package
// does.
