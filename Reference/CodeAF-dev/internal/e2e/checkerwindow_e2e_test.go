// A CHECK THAT RAN OUT OF TIME, ON A REAL SCREEN, AGAINST A MODEL THAT THINKS
// FOREVER.
//
// This is issue #941's own acceptance, and it is the subtest the fix is not
// finished without: five of thirty-four landings in one acceptance drive read
// `your call` on work that was correct, because the checker's model call was
// cut at its thirty-second share of the reading window while a reasoning model
// thought without writing a word — twice, the second time from nothing, because
// the cut threw away everything the first had read.
//
// IT IS SCRIPTED AND IT NEEDS NO KEY, which is what makes it a gate rather than
// a drive. The whole subject is a model that never answers on its first call,
// and no real model can be asked to be that reliably: the stub below answers the
// checker's first request with a read, its second with thinking that does not
// stop until the client goes away, and the ask that follows the cut with the
// word. Everything between those three answers is the product.
//
// WHAT IT ASSERTS IS THE WIRE AND THE SCREEN TOGETHER, because #941 is a defect
// about both and the same family was unit-green and e2e-broken for a week
// (#184). On the screen: the landing says `done`, and never `your call`. On the
// wire: the cut call carried a thinking budget the window implies rather than
// nothing at all, and the ask after the cut carried what the checker had already
// read, with its thinking pass turned down as far as the model allows.
