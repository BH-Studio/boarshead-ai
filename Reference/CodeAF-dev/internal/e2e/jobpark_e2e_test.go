//go:build e2e

// A TASK WORKER WAITS OUT THE COMMAND IT STARTED (#568).
//
// WHAT THIS LANE PROVES, AND WHAT IT COST NOT TO HAVE IT. A worker ran a suite
// in the foreground, the command crossed the session's background-after clock,
// and [session.BashPromotedLead] answered the call — `still running as job 3;
// log at …`. That is a true sentence and, before the fix, a terrible question:
// the loop asked the model what to do next while the thing the whole node was
// waiting on still had minutes to run. There is nothing to do next, so a real
// model manufactured something — `sleep 28; tail <log>` — the loop detector read
// the repetition exactly right, and the node killed a healthy run and ended
// saying `this turn is going in circles`.
//
// So the four things asserted below are the four halves of that story: the
// promotion happened, NOTHING was asked of the worker between the promotion and
// the ending, the ending arrived WHOLE, and the node came to rest having
// reported what the command printed.
//
// WHY IT IS AN END-TO-END LANE AND NOT A UNIT TEST. internal/session pins the
// park against a scripted model, which is the right place to pin the mechanism.
// The defect was never the mechanism: it was what a REAL model does when it is
// handed a running job and asked for a step. Only a real model can invent the
// polling this file exists to find the absence of.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS. One task, one worker, one minute of shell, on
// deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash with every text row pinned to it
// ([pinEveryTextModel]) — cents, and the figure is read back off the machine's
// own usage ledger ([ledgerSince]) rather than guessed.
