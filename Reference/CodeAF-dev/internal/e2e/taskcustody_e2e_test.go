// CUSTODY, THROUGH THE PERSON'S OWN DOOR, ON A REAL MODEL (issue #567).
//
// The measured incident is one sentence: a turn was moved to a task while two
// pieces were still out under the conversation, and the drawing it moved on mixed
// a local job with the coordination of those two — wait for them, integrate their
// branches, fire the reviews, open the pull request. A task admitted by that road
// is a ROOT, and `tasks` inside a task answers only the children that task itself
// created, so the worker's first look at the rail said "No tasks have run in this
// project yet." and the rest of its deadline went on guessing at branch names.
//
// internal/session's taskcustody_unit_test.go reads the drawing on its own and
// taskcustody_test.go drives the road with a scripted model. NEITHER OF THEM ASKS
// A MODEL WHAT IT WOULD ACTUALLY DRAW. This one does: the mark reader and the
// handoff writer are real calls on [e2eModel], the person's sentence is the one
// from the field, and every assertion below is taken off THE DISK — the graph's
// own checkpoint file and the session journal — rather than off anything the
// model said in prose.
//
// ── THE TWO PIECES ARE OUT AND THEY COST NOTHING ──
//
// A piece is "still out" when it is a root of this conversation's graph and has
// not settled ([Agent.piecesStillOut]), and QUEUED is not settled. So the two are
// admitted through the person's own door ([session.Agent.StartTask]) with the
// admission governor's memory floor set past anything a machine has
// (custodyMemoryFloor, session.Config's TaskMinFreeMB): the frontier holds them
// for `machine busy`, they never take a worktree, they never make a model call,
// and they are genuinely being held by the conversation at the moment the brief
// is written. That is the e2e equivalent of the in-package fixture's runner that
// records nothing and settles nothing, and it is what keeps this file to a few
// cents rather than two real implementation tasks.
