//go:build e2e

// do_run_engine_e2e_test.go drives `codeaf do` ON THE RUN ENGINE end to end:
// the built binary, a real provider, the bash belt, and a run that writes a file
// in the directory it was handed, in place and uncommitted.
//
// where the column of this lane comes from
//
// THE DOOR IS THE BUILT BINARY, not a package seam. Every other rig in this
// repository reaches inside and hands a scripted agent to a struct; this one
// starts the process a person starts, with the belt's switch in its
// environment ([session.BashBeltAsked]), and reads back the one machine object
// `do --json` promises ([resultEnvelope]). That is the only way to prove the
// run road is reachable by a person at all — that the switch survives the door,
// that the run engine dispatches the belt worker, and that the run keeps the
// door's contract with the directory: edited in place, nothing committed.
//
// THE WHOLE RUN IS ONE FILE AND NO COMMIT. A throwaway repository is made with
// one committed file; the run works in it in place and writes `HELLO.md`; the
// lane reads that file off the working tree, finds it among the envelope's
// files, and checks the branch still stands on the commit it stood on, because
// `--dir` promises the directory "edited in place" and never a commit.
//
// THE SEATS ARE THE PROFILE'S, AND THE PROFILE IS WHERE THEY ARE PINNED. The
// run engine seats each task from the PROFILE's tier rows — [run.CrewFactory]
// reads [config.TierSeatAt] — not from the `--model` flags the door prints, so
// a run left to the profile would ride the person's own crew. The lane writes
// every tier row to the one cheap model this suite rides, exactly as the rest
// of the package pins its models ([newWorld]'s rows, [newHome]'s overrides),
// and names the same model on both flags so the door's receipt and the crew
// agree.
//
// IT SKIPS RATHER THAN FAILS WHEN IT CANNOT BE HONEST: no provider key on any
// road the product reads ([liveKey]), or no built binary (`make build` is the
// door, and a suite that rebuilt would be testing a binary nobody ran).
//
// THE CEILING OF NOTHING HAS NO DOOR, SO IT IS NOT DRIVEN HERE. The run road
// refuses a cost cap of zero before it opens the store or builds a worker — a
// refusal whose whole promise is exit 3 and a `blocked_on` naming the price, the
// one ending on this road a caller raises and reruns (do.go's `runErrand`). But
// the cap it reads is `doRequest.costCap`, an in-process field the door has no
// flag for ON PURPOSE: zero dollars is this product's word for NO ceiling
// (`internal/manual/pages/money-and-limits.md`), the same reading the chat
// door's `--max-cost` keeps (`chatv3.go`'s `chatBudget`, which ignores a zero),
// and a flag that read zero as "may spend nothing" would be a second reading of
// one number beside every settings row's. So a `codeaf do` a person starts
// cannot express a ceiling of nothing, and no untagged test can make it — the
// refusal is proven where it lives instead, by the do package's own
// `TestDoOnTheRunEngineStopsAtACostCapOfZero`, which hands the request a cap of
// zero and reads back the same exit 3 and `blocked_on` this lane would assert.
