// refusal_e2e_test.go is issue #266's replication, driven end to end: the real
// binary, a real terminal, and a router that PUBLISHES a machine on its
// endpoints page and refuses to serve the model from it.
//
// ── WHY IT IS A STUB AND NOT THE LIVE ROUTER ────────────────────────────────
//
// Every other subtest beside this one talks to a real model, and this one
// cannot: the defect is a DISAGREEMENT between two answers the router gives —
// the endpoints page under one id, the completion under another — and a live
// router cannot be asked to disagree with itself on demand. The reported run
// collected six 404s of it in ten minutes and nobody could reproduce it.
//
// So the router is `internal/lane/lanestub` with [lanestub.Lane.SheetOnly] set,
// which publishes a lane and will not serve it, and the refusal it answers with
// is the live body copied word for word:
//
//	Providers serving <model>: …, but your request's provider.only preference
//	permits only: ghost
//
// Everything above that is real: the binary a person runs, its own chooser, its
// own race, its own ladder, and the screen read back with capture-pane.
//
// ── WHAT IS ASSERTED AND WHAT IS GLIMPSED ───────────────────────────────────
//
// The four laws are asserted off the STUB'S OWN REQUEST LOG, which is a record
// of what the binary really did and is not subject to a race with a redraw: the
// refused machine is asked once, the next request leaves within two seconds
// demanding somebody else, no gap opens while the turn is working, and the turn
// still ends in an answer.
//
// The sentence on the status row is GLIMPSED, for the reason tuiphase_test.go
// gives about its own two sentences: while a request is actually in flight the
// phase clock owns that segment (render.go's servedRider), so `refused` is
// drawn in the moments between arms rather than held there, and a subtest that
// waited twenty seconds for it would be a subtest that fails on a fast machine.
// Caught, it is asserted whole; missed, it is written down as a FINDING and the
// four laws above still stand on their own.

// refusalModel is the model the staged router serves. It is spelled
// `openrouter/…` because that id is half of what still tells this build it is
// talking to THE SHIPPED ROUTER, and one of the two things that reading buys is
// which transport drives the loop ([provider.Client.ExecuteToolCallLoop] takes
// this adapter's own rather than the SDK's) — the loop whose ladder and whose
// refusal reading this test is about. IT IS NOT HOW THE RUN GETS LANES: since
// #419 and #433 the sheet and the routing preference both come from what the
// base ANSWERS, so the binary is pointed at the stub's plain [lanestub.Server.URL]
// and everything about the frontier is the product's own doing (#426).

// stopped honouring it would be breaking a promise the manual makes. What this
// test is about is the demand THIS PROCESS makes on its own account: the second
