// STEERING A TASK, END TO END, AGAINST A SCRIPTED MODEL.
//
// The rest of this package drives a real model, which is right for questions
// about judgment and wrong for this one: what is under test is a mark the engine
// writes and a row the surface draws, and both have to be the same on every run
// or the assertion is a coin toss. So this scenario stands a scripted endpoint in
// front of the real binary — the same dialect internal/provider speaks, the same
// shape test/remote/stub answers in — and drives the product through tmux
// exactly as a person's keyboard would.
//
// The journey is the one the issue is about (#252):
//
//	/task solo <brief>      one worker, started from the box
//	alt+t, enter            into that node's page
//	<a correction>, enter   the person bending work that is already running
//
// and the three things it proves: the correction lands as an elbow with the
// engine's own delivery clause, the node's record keeps it MARKED as a
// correction, and the page reopened afterwards draws it as an elbow again
// instead of as a second brief.

	// steerBrief is what the node is sent to do. The marker is what the scripted
	// endpoint reads, so the script is keyed off the person's own words.
	steerBrief = "PROBE-STEER write a file called hello.txt containing the word hello"
	// steerLine is the correction. It is the commonest steer there is — "no, the
	// other place" — which is also the one the elbow's own file names.
