// WHY IT IS NOT ANOTHER TABLE OF UNIT TESTS. internal/tui3 and internal/session
// both pin these words against a struct they built themselves, which is the
// right gate and cannot answer the question this file exists for: a person at a
// terminal, looking at a landing, reads ONE spelling of one state. Three of the
// four surfaces that disagreed before this wave were each green in their own
// package on the day they disagreed.
//
// WHICH SHAPES PAY FOR A MODEL AND WHICH DO NOT. A shape whose whole subject is
// the DRAWING of a landing is seeded as the graph a finished process left behind
// (tmux_test.go's seedDecidedFamily says why) and settled through the real engine
// door by a real keystroke — no model is asked anything, and what is measured is
// the surface and the engine. A shape whose subject is the WORK — a task that
// really runs, really writes a file and really lands — is run against
// deepseek-v4-flash, because there is no other way to find out what the card says
// about a landing nobody staged.
