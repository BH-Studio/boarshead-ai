//go:build ssh_bench

// remotebench_test.go MEASURES THE REMOTE-FILES WIRE AGAINST A REAL SECOND
// MACHINE, so that every number in docs/remote-files-bench.md is a number
// somebody produced on a link rather than a number somebody expected.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS BESIDE THE LOOPBACK TESTS. internal/remote's loopback proves
// the protocol: the real client against the real server over net.Pipe, fast and
// deterministic. What a pipe in one process cannot tell anybody is what the
// arrangement COSTS — a round trip is free over net.Pipe, base64 is free, ssh
// is not there at all, and a killed link is a thing a test invents rather than
// a thing that happens. Those are exactly the four numbers a person weighing
// `codeaf chat --host` against `scp` wants, so they are measured here, over
// ssh, against a machine in another room.
//
// THE LOCAL HALF RUNS IN THIS PROCESS. [benchLink.spawn] is cmd/codeaf's
// engineLink.spawn with the same shape — `ssh -T <dest> "codeaf engine …
// --workspace '<ws>'"`, stdin and stdout as one [io.ReadWriteCloser] — handed
// to [remote.Roam] as its dialer. So what is being timed is the wire the
// product actually uses, including its redialling, and not a re-implementation
// of it that might be faster for reasons nobody shipped.
//
// AND EVERY FETCH IS VERIFIED. A benchmark that does not check what came back
// is measuring corruption-tolerant speed, which is not a property anybody
// wants. [fiveDigest] is checked on every repetition of every fetch, the scp
// copies included, and [noteDigest] is checked once at the top so that a run
// pointed at the wrong directory stops there instead of publishing a table.
//
// WHAT IT NEEDS ON THE FAR MACHINE: a codeaf built from this branch (the two
// ends refuse each other at the door otherwise), and a workspace holding
// note.txt, sub/inner.txt, five-mb.bin and twenty-mb.bin. Nothing else on that
// machine is written to, and the one directory this harness makes is removed
// before it returns.
//
// TWO DEPARTURES FROM THE DOOR'S OWN SPAWN, both stated here because a
// benchmark that quietly ran something else than the product would be worthless.
//
//   - `--no-host`. The door lets the far `codeaf engine` attach to a session
//     HOST that outlives the connection, and that is the right default for a
//     conversation. It is the wrong one for a measurement on somebody else's
//     laptop: the numbers would be partly about a socket splice, an already
//     running daemon of unknown age would answer instead of the binary under
//     test, and the run would leave a new daemon behind. `--no-host` is the
//     shape internal/remote calls the floor — the engine serves this pipe and
//     ends with it — so what is timed is ssh, frames, and an engine, and the
//     far machine is left as it was found.
//   - A provider key in front of the command. The engine refuses to boot
//     without one even though nothing here submits a turn, so [keyEnv] is
//     passed through when it is set and [placeholderKey] satisfies the door
//     when it is not. THE PLACEHOLDER IS NEVER SPENT: this harness fetches
//     files and lists directories and never opens a turn, and the engine
//     writes no key to the far machine's profile.
//
// RUN IT:
//
//	CODEAF_BENCH_HOST=mac-engine go test -tags ssh_bench -run TestRemoteBench -v ./internal/e2e/
//
// The build tag keeps it out of `go test ./...` entirely, and with no
// CODEAF_BENCH_HOST it skips with the sentence that says what to set.
