// secondwindow_e2e_test.go is #761 ON THE REAL SCREEN: two windows on one
// conversation against one engine host, and what the one that is not typing
// draws where the running work belongs.
//
// THE COLUMN'S OWN LABEL IS THE ASSERTION. `tasks` is drawn only when there is
// a row under it — an empty section would spend a line announcing absence, which
// the emptiness law forbids (internal/tui3's margin.go) — so a roster column
// holding `+ /task` and no label is a column that knows about no work at all.
// That is exactly what #761 photographed while the engine's own checkpoint held
// two nodes running.

	// THIS IS THE DEFECT ITSELF (#761). Every window redials when the host it is
	// attached to goes — a rebuilt binary, a machine waking up — and a redial
	// gets its transcript and its status line back because a turn's events are
	// numbered and replayed. The standing lanes are neither, so before this fix
	// the rail went quiet for the rest of the session while the engine went on
	// running the very tasks the column was for.
	//
	// IT IS THE SECOND WINDOW THAT IS ASKED, because opening the conversation
	// there MOVED it: window A was told so and stepped back to home, which is
	// what #691 promises and what makes B the window a person is sitting in
	// front of when the host under it is replaced.
	//
	// AND THE PROOF IS A TASK STARTED AFTERWARDS, not the rows already drawn. A
	// rail keeps whatever it has been told — nothing wipes it when a link dies —
	// so a column that still shows the first task proves only that the surface
	// has a memory. A task commissioned after the repair is a CALL and not a
	// turn, so its row can only reach the column down the standing lane
	// (internal/remote's tasklane.go): if that lane did not come back with the
	// link, this row never arrives.
