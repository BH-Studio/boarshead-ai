// TASK FAMILIES, END TO END, ON BOTH GROUNDS.
//
// WHAT THIS LANE PROVES. A task that turns out to be wider than one worker hands
// parts out under itself, each part works somewhere of its own, and the whole
// family's product comes home into the person's material — on a git repository
// and on a plain folder alike. Everything below is asserted ON DISK: the files
// in the person's own directory, the mirror's git history, the session's task
// records and the division records in the workers' own journals. Not one
// assertion reads the model's prose, because a model saying it divided the work
// is exactly the claim this file exists to check.
//
// THE THREE SCENARIOS, AND THE ISSUES THEY STAND ON:
//
//   - a three-section report on a FOLDER ground (#230, #229, #281): the mirror is
//     a repository, the parts cut worktrees off it and merge back into it, and the
//     person's folder gets every part's file laid over it by name — and never a
//     .git of its own. The folder is SEEDED with the material every part reads,
//     which is what #281 made possible: ownership is read off a part's
//     done-condition, so a file named in every brief is nobody's claim.
//   - a two-part write-up on a REPOSITORY ground (#232): the parent writes its
//     plan down first, the parts start in a world that holds it, and the family
//     lands on the person's branch in one move.
//   - a division whose two parts claim the same file (#231): refused at
//     admission, before any part exists, and the worker carries on alone.
//   - an edit made in the person's folder while the work ran (#270): the landing
//     stands back rather than laying its ledger over it, names the file, and
//     leaves both versions on disk.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS AND HOW IT IS PINNED. Every call in the run — the conversation,
// the shaper, the sizing judge, the namer, each worker, the division's reviewer
// — rides deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash, because [pinEveryTextModel] writes the
// model into every row that can choose one: the four tiers, the task row, every
// text role and the fallback chain. That pinning is then CHECKED rather than
// assumed: each scenario reads the machine's own usage ledger back and fails if
// any other model answered.
