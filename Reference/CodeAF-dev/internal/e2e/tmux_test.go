//go:build e2e

// Package e2e drives the real `bin/codeaf` binary inside a real terminal.
//
// THE ONLY THING UNDER TEST IS THE PRODUCT AS A PERSON MEETS IT. Every other
// suite in this repository reaches inside — it builds an app struct, hands it a
// scripted agent, and reads rows back out of a model. That is the right shape
// for a unit test and it cannot answer the one question this file exists for:
// does the thing a person launches, on a real terminal, talking to a real
// model, do what the manual says it does. So this file starts tmux, sends the
// bytes a keyboard sends, and reads the screen back with `capture-pane`.
//
// IT SKIPS RATHER THAN FAILS when it cannot be honest: no provider key on any
// road the product reads, no tmux, no built binary. A suite that "passes" by
// not talking to a model is a suite lying about the only thing it was written
// to check. The key is resolved through [liveKey], not by reading one variable.
//
// EVERY RUN IS ITS OWN MACHINE. Each rig gets its own CODEAF_HOME under
// t.TempDir() — the whole state root moves with that one variable
// (internal/home) — and its own git-initialised workspace. A workspace under
// /tmp that is NOT a repository is treated by the door as "somewhere the person
// stood by accident" and gets an owned session in a private work directory
// (cmd/codeaf's chatv3_layout.go), which is not the shape any of these
// scenarios are about, so the workspace is always a repository.
// Every run also gets scheduler stand-ins and a separate login folder. The
// machine's own background timer is never this suite's timer.
