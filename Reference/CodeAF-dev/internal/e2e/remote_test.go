//go:build docker_e2e

// remote_test.go drives `codeaf chat --host` across THREE CONTAINERS ON ONE
// BRIDGE NETWORK — a surface machine, an engine machine, and a scripted model
// endpoint — so that the honesty laws of docs/REMOTE.md are proved against two
// genuinely different filesystems.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS BESIDE THE LOOPBACK TESTS AND DOES NOT REPLACE THEM.
// internal/remote/loopback.go drives the real client against the real server
// over net.Pipe, and that is the right test of the PROTOCOL: it is fast, it is
// deterministic, and if a change ever makes the wire care what it is riding,
// that file stops compiling. What it cannot prove is the product's actual
// claim. Decision 6 — "the engine machine is the authority, always" — is
// entirely about a path meaning different things on each side, and on one host
// with one home directory every path in the test exists on both ends. A surface
// that resolved a path locally would pass by coincidence. So this harness makes
// the coincidence impossible: the engine's workspace is a directory the surface
// container does not have, the surface's own directory is one the engine
// container does not have, and the two homes are laid out differently on
// purpose.
//
// WHY THE MODEL IS A STUB. The thing under test is the wire, not the model's
// judgment. test/remote/stub answers a script, so a turn does real work — it
// calls a real tool on the engine's real disk — with no API key, no bill, and
// no chance of a red run caused by a model choosing to paraphrase. See that
// file's header for the markers the scenarios below submit.
//
// RUN IT:
//
//	dockerd >/tmp/dockerd.log 2>&1 &   # if the daemon is not already up
//	go test -tags docker_e2e -run TestRemoteTwoMachines -v -timeout 20m ./internal/e2e/
//
// It SKIPS, never fails, on a machine with no docker, a daemon that will not
// answer, or an image that will not pull. The build tag keeps it out of
// `go test ./...` entirely.
