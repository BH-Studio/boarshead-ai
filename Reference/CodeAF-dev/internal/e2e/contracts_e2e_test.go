// TWO CONTRACTS, END TO END, AGAINST A REAL MODEL.
//
// WHAT THIS LANE PROVES. A worker is handed one document — its contract — and it
// does what the document says. Both issues below are the same failure read from
// two sides: the contract said something about a place or a command that was
// TRUE OF SOMEBODY ELSE, and the worker obeyed it anyway.
//
//   - #566, a worktree task and the addresses in its contract. A task that is
//     given a private copy is stood up in `<session>/trees/<id>` and, before the
//     fix, handed a WHAT TO PRODUCE naming absolute paths in the person's LIVE
//     checkout. A worker that follows the address it was given reads a directory
//     that is still moving under it, and its first write at that address is
//     refused by the ground guard as `is outside your copy`. After the fix the
//     contract's addresses resolve inside the task's own copy, the write lands
//     there, and nothing says `is outside your copy`.
//
//   - #569, a family-wide check and every part's done-condition. When a task
//     divides, the same broad check command copied into EVERY child's
//     done-condition orders the same expensive run several times over — each in a
//     tree that does not yet hold its siblings' files, so only the last of them
//     could be right. After the fix `divide_work` does not admit a division whose
//     siblings each carry the same command: it comes back as a plain refusal
//     beginning `not split:` naming that command, and the worker carries on.
//
// EVERY ASSERTION IS ON DISK OR ON THE SESSION'S OWN RECORDS. The node rows in
// the graph's checkpoint, the files in the task's private copy, the division
// records and tool results in the workers' own journals, the person's git
// history. Not one reads the model's prose, because a model saying it worked in
// its own copy is exactly the claim these tests exist to check.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS AND HOW IT IS PINNED. Every call rides deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash
// through [pinEveryTextModel], and that pinning is CHECKED rather than assumed:
// each run reads the machine's own usage ledger back through [familyRun.report]
// and fails if any other model answered.

a.md, b.md and c.md — a.md holds the first three topics, b.md the next three, c.md
the last three, about eighty words each. The three sections do not depend on each
other, so split this with divide_work into THREE parts, one file each.

Write every part's done-condition as TWO clauses with a semicolon between them.

The FIRST clause names the ONE file that part produces — a.md, b.md or c.md — and no
other file, because two parts whose done-conditions name the same file are two parts
claiming one file. README.md is shared: every part reads it and no part owns it, so
it belongs in the briefs and in no done-condition.

The SECOND clause is the whole report's own check, and it is the SAME in every part,
spelled exactly:

    ` + theWideCheck + `

Put that sentence in all three done-conditions, word for word, so that no part is
finished until the whole report is there.`
