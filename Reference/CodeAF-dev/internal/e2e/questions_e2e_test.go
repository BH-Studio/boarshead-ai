//go:build e2e

// questions_e2e_test.go is THE QUESTIONS WAVE, DRIVEN THROUGH THE REAL BINARY
// IN A REAL TERMINAL AGAINST A REAL MODEL.
//
// docs/design/questions/DESIGN.md is a contract about what a person sees when
// this engine hands them a decision: a line, a card, a room, a sheet; a chip
// that counts what is waiting; `esc` that means later and never cancel; a
// receipt that stays where the question was. Six lanes built that in eleven
// packages, each green in its own unit tests. This file is the one place that
// asks whether it reaches a person — it starts tmux, sends the bytes a keyboard
// sends, steers deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash into calling `ask` with the shape
// each scenario is about, and reads the screen back with `capture-pane`.
//
// ── THE DOOR THIS SUITE OPENS, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE DEFAULT ONE ────────────
//
// Nearly every scenario below launches `codeaf chat --no-host`, which keeps the
// conversation IN THIS PROCESS. The ordinary road since #736 is a session host
// over a unix socket (cmd/codeaf's chatv3_local.go), and a scenario about a
// compare table or a dial has nothing to say about a wire: opening the host road
// for all of them would put a second process, a socket and a redial loop between
// a keystroke and the row it is about, and every flake in either would be
// reported here as a defect in the surface.
//
// SO THE WIRE GETS A SCENARIO OF ITS OWN INSTEAD.
// `TheOrdinaryRoadCarriesAQuestionAndItsAnswer` opens the door that ships and
// asks the whole question through it — raised, counted, answered with a key,
// recorded — so the choice above can never quietly become a suite that only
// tests a door nobody opens.
//
// ── THE NEEDLES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Sentences THE PRODUCT spells come through [say] and are written down in
// tuiwords_test.go, whose untagged gate reads the surface's own sources back —
// that is the law this package has carried since #184. Sentences the MODEL
// spells are steered by the prompt in each scenario and are typed here as
// literals, exactly as the standing lane types the words it asked a model for:
// a table of product sentences is a source of truth, and a table of things a
// model happened to say is a table of coincidences.
//
// AND AN ANSWER IS BOTH, SO IT IS COMPOSED RATHER THAN PASTED. `1 delete it` is
// the scenario's own word with the PRODUCT's key grammar in front of it, so it
// goes through [keyedWord] and never into a literal here. Nine of them were
// pasted as `[1] delete it`, #933 took the brackets off every key, and this
// suite spent a fortnight waiting three minutes at a time for screens that were
// already right (issue #998). [TestNoNeedleSpellsAKeyTheSurfaceStoppedSpelling]
// is the untagged law that now refuses one.
//
// ── WHAT IT COSTS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// About a dollar for the whole file on deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash, and about
// forty minutes, most of it waiting for the model to load the `questions`
// capability group and then answer with one `ask` call. Iterate one at a time:
//
//	go test -tags e2e -run 'TestQuestionsE2E/ALine' -count=1 -timeout 15m -v ./internal/e2e/
//	go test -tags e2e -run TestQuestionsE2E -count=1 -timeout 90m -v ./internal/e2e/
//
// It SKIPS rather than fails with no provider key, no tmux or no bin/codeaf,
// exactly as the suite beside it does — and the key is resolved by the product's
// own three roads, through [liveKey].
