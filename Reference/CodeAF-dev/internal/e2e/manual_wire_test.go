// WHAT A STRANGER'S QUESTION MEETS ON THE WIRE.
//
// internal/manual measures its own retrieval for free and exactly: the
// twenty-five plain questions of [asked.Plain] and the cold [asked.HeldOut] set
// are ranked with no model in the loop, and the floors in plainquestions_test.go
// hold. THAT NUMBER IS NOT WHAT A PERSON MEETS. The model does not search what it
// was asked — it composes a query of its own, and on a corpus of a few dozen
// short sections two words nobody said move the ranking off the page (#307).
//
// So this lane asks the SAME forty-seven questions through the surface a person
// uses, one fresh conversation each, on `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`, and reads
// off transcript.jsonl three things for every one of them: the query the model
// composed, whether it opened the manual at all, and which pages came back. The
// free number and this one are then about the same questions, which is the whole
// reason [asked] is a package rather than a table in a test file.
//

// deepseek-v4-flash while #307 landed — three with the fix and two without,
// same file, same code path — and what they measured was:
//
//	                     opened   first   within four
//	the 25, without        19/25   11/25    18/25
//	the 25, without        17/25   14/25    16/25
//	the 25, with           19/25   14/25    18/25
//	the 25, with           20/25   12/25    20/25
//	the 25, with           22/25   13/25    22/25
//	held out, without      18/22    5/22    12/22
//	held out, without      17/22    5/22    16/22
//	held out, with         17/22    6/22    13/22
//	held out, with         13/22    5/22    11/22
//	held out, with         17/22    5/22    15/22
//
// The spread inside one column is bigger than the difference between the two
// halves of the table, and the reason is in the first column: WHETHER THE MODEL
// REACHES FOR THE TOOL AT ALL moves by up to nine questions between runs — it
// answers from memory, or reads "my files" literally and runs `ls` — and a turn
// that never opened the manual cannot reach a page. Read against the turns that
// DID look something up: on the twenty-five the page reached the model 60 times
// of 61 with the fix and 34 of 36 without, and on the cold set 39 of 47 against
// 28 of 35, coming FIRST 16 times of 47 against 10 of 35. The direction is
// right and none of it is significant at three passes to two. The claim this
// file can make honestly is that the page stays REACHABLE through the model
// that answers — which nothing free in this build notices — not that it moved a
// number by three.
//
// So the floors below sit under the LOWEST of the passes. A floor at a measured
// number would go red on the model's own appetite rather than on a regression,
// and a red that means "the model was in a mood" is a red nobody reads. Read the
// run's own log lines for what the wire does today.
//
// They are deliberately SEPARATE from plainquestions_test.go's floors. Those
// measure the corpus, exactly and for free; these measure the corpus THROUGH a
// model and cost money, and folding the two together would let a mood look like
// a page becoming unreachable.
