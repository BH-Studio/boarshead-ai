// Package pdfx is the LOCAL RUNG of the document ladder: PDF text, extracted
// in this process, out of this binary, with no service to call and nothing to
// install.
//
// The ladder's shape is the reason this package is one small file. A document
// arrives and something has to read it; the rungs go from cheapest to dearest —
// an embedded text layer here, then OCR, then a vision model looking at the
// page as a picture. The overwhelming majority of PDFs a person hands a coding
// session (a spec, a paper, an invoice, an API reference) carry a text layer,
// and reading it is microseconds of CPU. Paying a vision model to look at a
// picture of text the file already contains is the expensive answer to a
// question nobody had to ask.
//
// So the engine here is github.com/AOShei/go-fast-pdf: pure Go, zero
// dependencies, MIT, compiled straight into the static binary. The rejected
// alternatives were not worse at reading PDFs — they were worse at SHIPPING:
// PDFOxide wants a runtime .so beside the binary and extractous wants Tesseract
// installed, and a rung of the ladder that fails on a machine where nobody ran
// apt-get is not a local rung at all.
//
// The seam is deliberately one function wide. Extract(path) is the entire
// contract this package owes the rest of the program, which is what makes the
// engine swappable: a better pure-Go extractor lands as an edit to this file
// and nothing above it moves.
//
// THREE OUTCOMES, NOT TWO. A caller that only knows "text or error" cannot tell
// a broken file from a scanned one, and those two need opposite responses from
// the model — the first is a dead end, the second is a handoff to the ladder's
// OCR rungs. So a PDF that parses cleanly but carries no text layer gets its
// own sentinel (ErrNoTextLayer, with the page count attached) rather than an
// empty string and a shrug.
