// Package approval is the consent policy for the v3 session agent: one pure
// function from a tool call to allow, prompt or deny.
//
// Three packages in this tree guard three different moments and are easy to
// confuse. [consent] prices a job before it starts — money. [gate] holds a
// workforce command for a countdown before it commits — time. This one answers
// a narrower and more frequent question: the model has asked to run a tool
// right now, and something has to decide whether that runs, asks, or is
// refused. It is ported from omp's tools.approval plus its bash pattern list,
// because that design has one property worth keeping — the dangerous case is
// decided by MATCHING, not by a model's judgement about its own request.
//
// This package is policy only. It reads no config, touches no session, spawns
// nothing, and deliberately imports nothing from either — the wiring wave maps
// the config registry onto [Load] and hangs [Policy.Check] off the tool loop.
// Keeping it that way is what makes the bash matching law testable as a table
// rather than as an integration test with a shell on the other end.
//
// The interesting law lives in bash.go: deny and prompt catch a dangerous
// fragment anywhere in a compound line, while allow vouches only for a line it
// matches whole. That asymmetry is the entire point of the package.
