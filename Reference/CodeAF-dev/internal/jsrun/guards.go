// GUARDS AND DEOPTIMIZATION — the JIT's answer, which is PRD §1's frame for the
// whole design.
//
// Compiled code runs behind guards, and a guard that does not hold deoptimizes
// to the interpreter rather than aborting the program. Here the compiled code is
// the bundle and the interpreter is the general worker: a check that does not
// pass does NOT fail the task, it comes back as [exec.RunResult] with FellBack
// set, and the caller does the work the long way with the original input.
//
// A GUARD IS FREE OR NEARLY SO, which is what makes it a guard and not the first
// step of the run. Three kinds are decided by looking — a file, a tool, a field
// — and are checked FIRST no matter what order the manifest lists them in,
// because the fourth kind costs a model call and there is no reason to pay for
// it before finding out whether something free has already settled the question.
//
// NOTHING HERE MAY BE SPELLED "GUARD" WHERE A PERSON READS IT. The vocabulary
// law is explicit about this case: "needed a closer look", never "guard failed".
// [exec.Guard.Because] exists so the sentence was written by somebody who knew
// what the check was for, and every fallback below prefers it over anything this
// file could compose.

// judgementBudget is how many questions a subharness may ask the model before it
// runs. PRD §5 allows "at most one tiny model call" among the guards, and it is
// enforced at load ([Bundle.Validate]) rather than at run time so that a bundle
// which would have been too expensive to check is an authoring error with a
// sentence, not a run that quietly skipped a check.

// person reads when one of them did not pass. An empty answer is "go".
