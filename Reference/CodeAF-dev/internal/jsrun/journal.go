// THE INCREMENTAL JOURNAL WRITER, and the run's ledger, which are one object
// because they are one fact.
//
// [exec.Spend] summed across a run's journal entries IS the run's ledger — the
// contract says so and this is where that stops being a claim: every host call
// writes its entry and folds its spend through the same method, so there is no
// second piece of arithmetic that could disagree with the first. A surface that
// added up the journal and a surface that read RunResult.Spend get the same
// number because they are reading the same additions.
//
// NOTHING HERE LOCKS, which is the law internal/subharness/usage.go states about
// itself and internal/exec/journal.go restates about [exec.Spend]. This runtime
// earns it the plain way: THE PROGRAM RUNS ON ONE GOROUTINE AND HOST CALLS ARE
// SERIAL BY CONSTRUCTION. goja calls a bound Go function synchronously, on the
// goroutine running the script, and this package binds nothing that starts
// another one — there is no setTimeout, no worker, no job queue a program can
// reach. The only other goroutine a run has is the fuel watchdog (fuel.go),
// which touches the interpreter through [goja.Runtime.Interrupt] — atomic by
// goja's own design — and touches this recorder not at all. A runtime that ever
// ran host calls concurrently owns this type's safety along with everything else
// it changed about running a program.
