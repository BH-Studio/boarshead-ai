// Package jsrun is THE JavaScript runtime for subharnesses — one generic Go
// runner parameterized by a bundle.
//
// There is not one runner per subharness and there must never be: there is one
// goja host, and a bundle is its argument ([New]). That is PRD §5's shape taken
// literally, and it is what makes "the person cannot tell which is which" a
// structural fact — a JS subharness and a Go one arrive at [exec.Registry] as
// the same [exec.Runner] and are described by the same [exec.Manifest].
//
// THE SANDBOX IS THE HOST API. goja has no filesystem, no network and no clock
// unless the host hands them in, so the six doors bound in host.go are the whole
// capability surface of a bundle, and they are exactly [exec.Env]'s six. There
// is no seventh way for a program to spend, reach out, or ask — which is what
// makes summing the journal the same thing as summing the run.
//
// THIS PACKAGE NEVER RUNS THE FALLBACK ITSELF. A guard that does not pass, or a
// program that breaks partway, comes back as [exec.RunResult] with FellBack set
// and NO error: the work still has to get done, and the caller that dispatched
// this runner is the one holding [exec.Registry.Generalist] and the original
// input. Deciding to run `linear` here would put the decision in the one place
// that cannot see whether the caller wanted a fallback at all — a headless
// invocation and a task node want different things — so the runner reports and
// the caller chooses.
