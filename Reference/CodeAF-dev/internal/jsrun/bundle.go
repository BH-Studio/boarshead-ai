// THE BUNDLE, as this runtime needs it — and no more than that.
//
// PRD §6 describes a directory on disk: manifest.json, program.js, prompts/*.md,
// memory.md, evals/. That directory is the STORE LANE'S business, and this
// struct is deliberately not a picture of it. It is the four things a run
// actually reads plus the two doors that let a run look at the world without
// this package owning a filesystem: what to run, what it is allowed to do, the
// prompt assets its ai() calls may name, and where its own memory lives.
//
// KEEPING IT SMALL IS THE POINT. The store lane constructs one of these; a field
// here is a thing the store has to be able to fill, so every field that is not
// load-bearing for a run is a coupling nobody asked for. `evals/` is absent
// because nothing executes evals yet, and a slot for it here would be
// half-built machinery pretending to work.
type Bundle struct {
	// Manifest is everything true before the run: identity, cost shape, the
	// whitelist tool() filters through, the guards checked on the way in, and
	// the output shape a finished run has to produce.
	Manifest exec.Manifest

	// Program is the source of program.js, whole. It is compiled once by [New],
	// so a bundle that will not compile is refused at load rather than at run —
	// which is what makes a syntax error an AUTHORING error with a line number
	// rather than a run that mysteriously fell back.
	Program string

	// Source is the name errors are reported against. Empty is "program.js",
	// which is what the file is actually called; a store that keeps several
	// files in one bundle names the one it handed over.
	Source string

	// Prompts is the prompt assets by name, the map ai()'s first argument
	// selects from. The key is the bare name — `summarise` for
	// `prompts/summarise.md` — and [Runner] normalizes a `prompts/` prefix and a
	// `.md` suffix on the way in, so a program that names the file the way an
	// author thinks of it still resolves.
	//
	// A NAME THAT IS NOT IN HERE IS REFUSED, which is the whole enforcement of
	// the no-inline-prompts law (PRD §5, §12): prompts are files so they can be
	// diffed, reviewed and revised, and a program that could pass its prompt as a
	// string would put the one thing worth improving somewhere nothing can
	// improve it.
	Prompts map[string]string

	// Memory is this subharness's OWN memory — its memory.md in its own bundle,
	// not the session's. Nil is a bundle whose memory the store has not opened,
	// and then remember() and recall() fall through to the [exec.Env]'s own
	// doors, which is the honest fallback rather than a silent no-op.
	Memory Memory

	// Look is the free way a guard checks the world before a run: does this file
	// exist, is this tool on the belt. It is a door rather than a filesystem
	// because this package has none — goja has no filesystem unless the host
	// hands one in, and a runtime that quietly grew one for its own guards would
	// have handed itself the thing it refuses the program.
	//
	// NIL MEANS THE WORLD CANNOT BE LOOKED AT, and a file or tool guard that
	// cannot be checked DOES NOT PASS. The safe answer to "I could not tell" is
	// the long way, not the fast path.

	// Fuel is what this run may spend before it stops. The zero value takes the
	// manifest's own cost shape and this package's defaults; see [Fuel].

// Memory is a subharness's own accumulated domain notes — the memory.md in its
// bundle, opened by the store lane. The two methods are exactly the two doors
// [exec.Env] spells, so a store that already implements the Env halves
// implements this by having them.

// guard rather than the first step of the run.

	// ToolOnBelt says whether the tool a [exec.GuardTool] names is actually

// Prompted is an [exec.Env] that wants this bundle's prompt assets.
//
// IT EXISTS BECAUSE THE CONTRACT PASSES A REF AND THE MODEL NEEDS TEXT.
// [exec.Env.AI] takes a promptRef by design — the ref is what gets journaled,
// what a later revision is argued about, and what a per-call-site cache will one
// day be keyed on — but the Env that makes the actual model call has no bundle
// to resolve the ref against. So a run hands its prompts to an Env that asks for
// them, once, before the first call. An Env that does not implement this is
// handed nothing and resolves refs its own way; nothing about the contract
// changes either way.

// interpreter can count instructions without rewriting the program's source. A
// host call is the operation this runtime can count exactly and the only one it
// can count for free — and the runaway loop that an instruction budget was
// wanted for is caught by [Fuel.Wall], which interrupts the VM mid-loop no
// matter what the loop is doing.
