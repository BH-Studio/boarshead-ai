// THE GATE JUDGES THE CHANGE, NOT A SENTENCE ABOUT IT.
//
// A worker that drives a whole pipeline behind a process boundary used to hand
// the gate one line, and on the ending that carried no line at all it handed
// "the coding run ended without saying how it went". The gate then judged a
// void, which it did differently every time it was asked. The account arrives
// as rows — the diff and the verification story, in the same grammar as the run
// tail beside them — so the judge is reading what happened rather than a claim
// about it.
