// THE REMAINDER JUDGE WAS SHOWN ALMOST NOTHING.

// It received the brief and the worker's final paragraph — and the prompt told
// it, in as many words, that exhaustion is not evidence of incompleteness. So a
// leaf cut off mid-`sh` with `undefined: logf` in its build was judged finished
// on its own closing sentence, "All 722 tests pass. Let me verify the dry-run
// tests specifically:", and the node was ✓ two seconds later. Every fact that
// would have contradicted it was already in the record and none of it was read.
