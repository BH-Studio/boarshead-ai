// The §6 regression test.
//
// Measured on a real run: a leaf whose brief named the module, the file, the
// interface type, the constructor and a `go build` acceptance check failed, and
// the node that replaced it carried 319 characters of title-and-summary — every
// one of those facts gone. Nothing truncated them. The replacement was a
// brand-new node authored from failure context, so there was nothing to lose
// them from: no object survived the re-target.
//
// What this pins is the rule the object makes enforceable. A replacement may be
// re-aimed and may not be re-authored: Done is identical, byte for byte, and
// the original instruction is still inside the one the replacement receives.
