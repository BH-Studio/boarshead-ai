// The door the acceptance mapping goes through, which is the same door a
// citation goes through.
//
// A JUDGE'S SAY-SO IS VOCABULARY. The mapping asks one model call which check
// exercises which behaviour, and until this existed the only thing weighed about
// the answer was that the check NAME EXISTED in the roster — a real check, said
// to cover a real behaviour, with nothing between the two but the model's
// confidence. ofetch's runs kept naming the same family of behaviours as
// exercised by nothing (`circuitBreaker: true, defaults are
// halfOpenMaxRequests = 1` and its four siblings) while the suite grew checks
// about the breaker in general, and a mapping weighed on vocabulary alone will
// eventually pair those two: the words are about the same subject, and the
// check is not about that behaviour.
//
// So the pairing is GROUNDED BY STRUCTURE, exactly as an admitted citation is
// (grounding.go): a check may satisfy a point only where the names the point
// spells distinctively are names the check itself spells — in its own identity,
// or in the body of the file that identity comes out of. That is a fact about
// two strings and a file on disk, and no model has a say in it.

// not read grounds nothing, so the point stays unexercised.

// answered it.
//
// A POINT THAT SPELLS NO NAME IS NOT JUDGED HERE, and that asymmetry is
// deliberate. "Normal scrolling must still update the visible viewport" names
// nothing distinctive; there is no structural question to ask of it, and a door
// that answered "unexercised" to every such behaviour would fail every prose
// request this program is given — a floor that refuses everything is not a
// floor. The door speaks where the request spelled something, which is where a
// mapping can actually be wrong in a way that is checkable.
