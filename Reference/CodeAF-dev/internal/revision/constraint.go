// ── the rules the person set, held against what the run changed ──────────────
//
// A CONSTRAINT IS A LAW OF THE RUN AND NEVER ADVICE. Every other finding in this
// gate is a reading: of the request, of the repository, of two photographs
// subtracted. This one is arithmetic over the person's own sentence — they said
// the run may change no files, or may change only these, and the workspace's own
// before-and-after list either agrees or it does not.
//
// It is held before a model is bought for the reason the regression is: the
// answer is already known and a judge's cost would buy nothing. It is held
// ABOVE the regression because it is the only finding here whose standard is the
// person's own words rather than a property of the tree — a run that broke a
// rule while leaving a green repository behind has still done the one thing it
// was told not to do.
//
// The measured case is #427: `codeaf do "…report the final line it prints.
// Change no files."` did exactly that in its first leaf, and the repair nodes
// its own review spliced behind it wrote a test into an existing `_test.go` and
// a shell script at the workspace root. Twice out of two. Nothing in the gate
// read the constraint, nothing in the growth rules would refuse a round for it,
// and two of those rules actively rewarded the writing — "changed nothing on
// disk" was read as a repair that had not repaired.
