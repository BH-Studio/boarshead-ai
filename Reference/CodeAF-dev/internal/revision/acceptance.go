// The acceptance settlement: the half of the gate that asks whether anything
// CHECKS what the person asked for.
//
// The settlement lane fixed the refusal path — a gate that names a gap and is
// overruled by a rule. The sweep that followed it proved the fix and uncovered
// this: two of five graded runs ended at exit 0, reward 0, because the gate had
// said YES. ofetch passed a deliverable opening "All 56 tests pass" at 41 of 47
// hidden tests; happy-dom passed "All tests pass (31/31)" at 13 of 14. In both
// the gate accepted THE WORKER'S CLAIM ABOUT TESTS THE WORKER WROTE ITSELF,
// which is FAILSAFE clause 2 broken in the one place the whole verdict is
// decided. See docs/design/gate/ACCEPTANCE.md.
//
// Everything here answers one question — is there a check that exercises this
// behaviour — and it answers it from two sources, neither of which is prose: the
// check declarations in the worker's own diff, and the identities the project's
// own test runner printed. The deliverable's sentence about its tests is read by
// nothing in this file.

// timed out somewhere else in the repository says nothing whatever about them,
// and holding such a delivery partial over it charges an errand for a silence
// that could not have acquitted it either.
//
// The read-only errand is the case that measured it: "run this command and
// report the final line, change no files", over a project whose whole-suite
// reading was cut at its ceiling, failed Whole() and left as `partial` — and
// there was never a check that could have exercised anything it asked for.
