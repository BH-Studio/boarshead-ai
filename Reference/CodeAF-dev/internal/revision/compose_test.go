// A GATE THAT FAILS THE WORDS MUST NOT BUY THE WORK AGAIN.
//
// The measured failure: a leaf that changes the workspace landed its change, the
// project's own suite went green, and the delivery gate failed the deliverable's
// PROSE. The one revision round that bought re-ran the whole leaf into a tree
// where the fix was already in — 23 model calls, zero edits, 80% of the leaf's
// bill — and then its empty outcome replaced the pass that had done the work.
//
// The decision that stops it is three structural facts and no reading of the
// critique's words, which is what makes it a mechanism rather than a judgement
// wearing one.
