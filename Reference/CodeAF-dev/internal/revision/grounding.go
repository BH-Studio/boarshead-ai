// ── what a review's finding is weighed against ───────────────────────────────
//
// A gap is what the person asked for and did not get. The rule that decides
// whether a review may buy work over one has always been a provenance check —
// are the words it claims to be a failure of somebody's but its own — and for a
// long time it asked that question of ONE piece of text, in ONE way: is this
// finding a contiguous verbatim run of characters inside the request.
//
// Measured over ten headless runs, that question refuses the right answer more
// often than the wrong one. Seven of ten refused findings were quotations of the
// request with a middle skipped; two more quoted the working method, which one
// door of the rule already accepted and the other had never been told about.
// Every one of them named work the run had genuinely promised and not done, and
// each refusal delivered the shortfall as done. See docs/design/gate/SETTLEMENT.md.
//
// GROUNDS ARE THE PROMISES THIS RUN MADE BEFORE IT BEGAN WORKING. Three things
// answer to that and nothing else does: the person's own request, the working
// method the leaf was held to, and the compiled plan's stopping criterion. All
// three were fixed before a word was produced, so none of them can have moved in
// response to what the work turned out to be — which is the whole property the
// invariant is protecting. The compiled goal, the working decisions and the last
// round's output are codeaf talking to codeaf, and a finding that can only quote
// those is a preference rather than a failure.
//
// One value, read by both doors. The revision round and the extension used to
// weigh a finding against different ground sets, which is how a run could pay
// for a repair against a standard and then be told the same standard was an
// invention.
