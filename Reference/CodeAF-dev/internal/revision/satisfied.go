// The one question that can end a run: is the request, exactly as the person
// wrote it, satisfied by what is in hand?
//
// NOTHING IN THIS SYSTEM ASKED IT. The headless door settles when every node is
// terminal; the growth governor judges the PLAN's own criterion; the gate names
// absences against a checklist. "Done" was when the plan ran out, never when the
// request was met — and the measured cost of that is an errand that was
// satisfied by its first leaf two minutes in and then ran into a 700-second wall
// twice out of two, spending more than 97% of its money after the answer already
// existed (2026-09-02, deepseek-v4-flash).
//
// IT IS ASKED AT THE MOMENT A ROUND WOULD OTHERWISE BE BOUGHT, AND NOWHERE
// ELSE. Not per turn, not per node, not on the happy path: at the gate about to
// buy a repair, and at the extension about to buy a remainder. Its cost is
// therefore bounded by the rounds it replaces — one call in place of a leaf —
// which is the whole reason it is affordable to ask at all.

// Every sentence after the first is a refusal of a way this question has

// sentence "The command completed. The final line printed was:", calling it "a
// report about the output, not the output itself". "Do not add what a careful
// engineer would also do" is the acceptance prompt's rule, and it is here for
// the identical reason: every requirement invented at this seam is a round
// bought against a request nobody made. And verification of finished work is
// named explicitly because the growth governor's spiral doctrine is exactly
// this failure one level up — checking it again is not the request, it is a

const requestMetPrompt = `You decide whether a request, exactly as the person wrote it, has been satisfied by what is in hand.

You receive the verbatim request, the rules the person stated, the deliverable as it was produced, and the record of what the run changed.

Answer met only when every thing the request asked for is present in the deliverable or on disk as the record shows, and no stated rule was broken.

Form is not substance. An answer wrapped in a sentence, placed in a code block, or given under a heading is the answer. A different wording of the thing that was asked for is the thing that was asked for.

Do not add what a careful engineer would also do. Do not judge quality beyond what the request states. Do not treat verification of finished work as something missing: work that is done and not re-checked is done.

When it is not met, name the ONE thing the request asked for that is absent, quoting the request's own words for it. When it is met, that field is empty.

Answer with one bare JSON object and nothing else — no code fence around it and no sentence before or after it:
{"met": true, "missing": ""}`

// a call that failed, a reply that could not be parsed. THE FAIL-OPEN
