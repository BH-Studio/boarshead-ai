// The fact the judge was never handed: a definition that kept its name and
// changed its shape, beside the code that still uses the old shape.
//
// igel s12 is the whole of the case. The presence photograph worked — the run
// deleted eight public attributes off `Igel`, the gate said so
// (`This work removed a public name that existed before it`), a repair round was
// bought, and the next reading came back `lost: 0`. Then all twenty-four hidden
// tests failed with `TypeError: 'Configs' object does not support item
// assignment`. The run had rebound the module name `configs` from a dict to an
// instance of a small class it wrote, and the class had `__getitem__` and no
// `__setitem__`; every name was still there and the thing behind one of them no
// longer answered to how it was used.
//
// Nothing in this harness could say that. The presence photograph compares NAMES
// and this name was kept. The check-level reading only sees what somebody wrote
// a check for. The assertion door only weighs behaviours the REQUEST states, and
// nobody states "and the config object must still support item assignment",
// because nobody has to.
//
// So the gate is handed the structure and nothing else: which declarations the
// run's own diff overlapped, and how the rest of the project uses those names —
// counted, grouped by a closed set of syntactic shapes, and sampled with the
// file, the line and the line's own text. Whether a class with `__getitem__` and
// no `__setitem__` will survive twenty callers that subscript-assign it is a
// judgement, and it is left to the reader that is paid to make judgements.
// FAILSAFE.md clause 1 for the reading, clause 2 for where it comes from.
//
// EVERY SILENCE FAVOURS THE WORK. No diff, no workspace, no reader for the
// language, no declaration the diff overlaps, no consumer found — each of those
// adds nothing at all, and the judge sees exactly what it saw before this
// existed.
