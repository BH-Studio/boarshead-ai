// MissingProduces is the mechanical half of the delivery gate: the one fact a
// judge should never be paid to discover, settled before a model round is
// bought.
//
// When the plan's stopping criterion names files — and only then; a file name
// is never inferred from prose — every named file must be on disk and
// non-empty before a judge is asked anything. A missing or empty named file is
// a gate failure that names the absent files verbatim, in the same shape a
// judged gap takes, so the one-round repair flow the gate already owns runs on
// it unchanged. The model judge is skipped for that round: its cost buys
// nothing when the absence is a fact about the filesystem rather than a
// question about the text.
//
// ONE CITATION PER MISSING FILE. That is the whole of what this gate claims,
// and for a while it was not what it said. The gap was one comma-joined string
// handed to a rule that asks whether a citation is a verbatim span of the ask,
// and a list of five paths is a verbatim span of nothing — so a gate that had
// correctly found five promised files absent was refused as an invention, no
// repair round was bought, and a run that wrote no file at all settled as done.
// The list is what makes the sentence below true per file, which is how it was
// always meant to read: a file the person named buys its round, and a file the
// plan named alone is refused, on the same invariant that already bounds every
// other gap. See AdmitGapCitation, which weighs each citation on its own and
// admits a file the ask names under either spelling.
//
// Mechanical is set because a refusal downstream means something different
// here than it does for a judge's opinion. A judge can be wrong about whether
// a deliverable answers the ask; nothing can be wrong about whether a file is
// on disk. Refusing this gap declines to buy a repair round and settles
// nothing about whether the work landed — see deliveredWhole in
// cmd/codeaf/do.go, which is where the difference is spent.
//
// ok is false — and the caller judges exactly as it did before this existed —
// when the criterion named no files, or when every named file is present and
// non-empty. The path is byte-identical to before in both cases: the judgment
// is the model's, the spend is the model's, and nothing here ran.

// A FILE ANYWHERE UNDER THE WORKSPACE THAT ANSWERS TO THE NAME IS PRODUCED, and
