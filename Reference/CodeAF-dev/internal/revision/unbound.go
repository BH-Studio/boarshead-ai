// The fact one question further back than the changed-definition reading: a name
// the run's own sources READ that nothing in the tree binds.
//
// igel s14 is the whole of the case. The run rewrote `igel/configs.py` so that
// `temp_post_req_data_path` became a local inside a builder function, and
// `igel/servers/fastapi_server.py` still opened with
// `from igel.configs import temp_post_req_data_path`. All twenty-four hidden
// tests failed on `ImportError: cannot import name 'temp_post_req_data_path'`.
// The run's own checks were red and the gate said so — `The checks this work
// wrote fail: …` — and that sentence sends a worker to run a suite. It never
// said WHICH NAME, which is the one word the repair needed and the one word the
// tree could have supplied for nothing.
//
// Nothing else in this harness can reach it. The presence photograph compares
// two readings of the surface and this name is in neither; the changed-definition
// reading compares digests of names that are in both; the assertion door weighs
// behaviours the REQUEST states, and nobody states "and the names this code
// imports must exist". It is measured with no model, no toolchain and no type
// checker: verify.UnboundReferences reads the run's changed sources for
// references and the whole tree for bindings, and reports only the residue.
//
// EVERY SILENCE FAVOURS THE WORK, and there are a great many of them — see
// verify/unbound.go, where a dynamic construct, an unreadable base class, a
// module outside the tree and a partial index each cost this finding a whole
// scope rather than costing the work a false blocker.

// unboundReferences is what THIS JOB's finished tree reads and does not bind,
// re-taken at the gate against the record it is judging.
//
// IT IS RE-TAKEN AND NEVER CARRIED, which is removedSinceTheJobBegan's rule
// applied to the same shape of finding and for the same reason: a name a round
// left unbound and a later round bound must stop being a finding, and only a
// reading of the finished tree can say so. It also makes the finding reachable
// at a gate that judges a parent — a grown subtree does its work in children,
// and the child's readings are the child's.
//
// It needs no baseline. The question is about the tree as it stands and not
// about what it used to be, which is the one reading in this file that a job
// with no photograph at all still gets.
//
// settled is false where there is no workspace to read, and there the leaf's own
// answer stands exactly as it did.

// to, and a door that asked for a quotation would refuse this finding every
// single time.
//
// It names the reference and the site and not a remedy. Binding the name and
// deleting the reference are both answers, and which one is right is the repair
// round's business — this says only what the tree does not hold.

// ok is false when nothing was measured or nothing was found. A settlement that
// cannot read the tree hands back nil, which reads as no claim and never as
