// ── WHAT THE GATE IS JUDGING ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The delivery gate used to have exactly one answer to that question, and it was
// the wrong one wherever a run had changed a repository: the deliverable was the
// worker's final MESSAGE, fenced, and everything the run had actually done sat
// below it as a record the judge was invited to check the message against.
//
// That arrangement is FAILSAFE.md rule 2 read backwards — the evidence sourced
// FROM THE COMPONENT BEING CHECKED — and the run that made it undeniable is
// bench/deepswe textual-richlog-follow-state, nemotron-3.5-lightning, n1. The
// worker answered the delivery fence with a structured object,
// `{"contract": "…"}`, which is a quirk of one model and nothing else. Three
// gates in a row then reasoned about that object:
//
//	"The deliverable is a single JSON contract string, not the required Python
//	 source files. The fenced text between BEGIN DELIVERABLE and END DELIVERABLE
//	 contains only {"contract": "…"} — no _log.py, _rich_log.py …"
//
// while forty-two kilobytes of changed Python sat in the worktree and the
// artifact record named every file of it. The judge convicted the sentence and
// never once looked at the tree; the run ended partial at a cost of $0.46, and
// nothing in the store said that what had been judged was a sentence.
//
// So the subject is a property of the RUN and not of the prompt's layout:
//
//	THE DELIVERABLE OF A REQUEST THAT CHANGED THE TREE IS THE TREE. The worker's
//	final message is its CLAIM about that change, and a claim is read beside the
//	thing it is about, never in place of it.
//
// Which is docs/design/gate/SETTLEMENT.md §6 stated once more at the other door.
// §6 already settled that the delivered text may overturn a finding ONLY where
// the text is the whole of what the run left behind; this is the same rule
// applied one step earlier, to what the judge is handed in the first place.
// Where a run left nothing behind, the message IS the artifact and the fence
// holds it exactly as it always did — that is the question answered in prose,
// and nothing about it moves.

// Subject is what the delivery gate held between its fence markers.
//
// It is a recorded fact rather than an inference for the reason every other
// field on store.DeliveryGate is one: an autopsy asking "what did this gate
// actually read" has nothing else to go on, and the three refusals above are
// indistinguishable, afterwards, from three refusals over a real reading of the
// world.

//	 truncated excerpt ending mid-sentence"    (ofetch v4-flash s12, 4/47)
//	"src/textual/widgets/_rich_log.py — The file is truncated — it cuts off
//	 before the implementation of write(expand=True) …"  (textual v4-flash s12, 15/20)
//
// Both are true of the READING and false of the run — the files were whole on
// disk and the changes were large — and both were reached the same way: a
// reader shown the opening of a file judged the opening. Saying "this is an
// excerpt" in front of it was tried and is not enough; a model reading source
// that stops mid-function concludes the source stops mid-function.
//
// So the percept is removed rather than annotated. A file shown whole cannot
// read as truncated, and a file shown only by name cannot read as truncated
// either — it reads as what it is, a file on disk that there was no room to
// print. The diff still travels underneath (Evidence.Patch), which is where a

// functions.
//

// ── THE VERDICT THE TREE SUBJECT ADMITS ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// A finding about the FENCE has to be structurally unsayable, not discouraged.
// The prompt could be told a dozen ways that the fenced material is the change
// and not a message, and the run this closes proves what that is worth: the
// prompt already said, in its own words, "Read the fenced text itself before you
// say anything about it", and three verdicts described a JSON object anyway.
//
// So the shape of a refusal changes with the subject. Where the run changed the
// tree, a fail must name ONE FILE OF THE RECORD and quote the behaviour of the
// request that file fails. The file is a field with the record as its enum, so a
// routed endpoint refuses anything else on the wire; and it is checked here as
// well, against the same record, so a build with no router gets the same
// contract. A verdict that names neither is not a refusal this gate can read —
// it goes back through internal/shaped's one re-ask with the schema and its own
// words quoted at it, and if it still will not answer in shape the gate FAULTS.
//
// Which is the only honest ending for it. A judge that cannot say what is wrong
// with a file the run changed has not judged the run, and FAILSAFE.md's floor
// says a check that did not happen may not be the reason a run reports itself
// whole.

// treeEnumFiles bounds the record that travels as an enum. Past it the field
// keeps its meaning and loses its wire-level guard: the Go-side check below is
// the one that decides, and a schema carrying two hundred paths would spend more
// of the prompt on the list than on the files.

// READS, and it is the other half of the same failure.
//
// A deliverable that arrives as a data object is not a bad answer; it is an
// answer in the wrong shape, which is a thing this system already knows how to
// repair everywhere except here. internal/shaped has owned that repair for every
// call that asks a model for an object and gets prose; the delivery is the one
// ask in the system pointing the other way, and it had no repair at all — so a
// model quirk became three silent re-drives, a partial run, and a store with no
// structured_repair event in it to say what had happened.
//
// ONE ASK, AND THE ORIGINAL IF IT FAILS. A delivery whose shape cannot be fixed
// is still the delivery; losing it would cost the run its only account of
// itself to fix a presentation problem.

// ReshapeDelivery repairs a deliverable that came back as a data object, once,
// before anything is judged.
//
// It is here rather than at the wiring seam because the delivery law is this
// package's — the gate is what holds a worker to the shape it was asked for —
// and because both doors that judge a deliverable reach it through one call.
// The journal is the caller's, on the context, exactly as every other repair's
// is: a run that reshaped its answer says so against the node it belongs to.
