// The second door the acceptance mapping goes through: a check must ASSERT the
// behaviour, not merely mention it.
//
// GroundMapping, beside this, asks whether the check SPELLS the names the
// behaviour spells. That question is answered by a file's whole text, setup and
// all, and textual s13 is what a run does with the difference. The request asked
// that `RichLog.write(..., expand=True)` honour expansion; the run wrote
// `test_rich_log_write_expand_preserves_full_width_justified`, which calls
// `rich_log.write("short", expand=True)` and then asserts `len(rich_log.lines) >
// 0` and `strip.cell_length >= 5`. Every name is there. Nothing is weighed. The
// gate had named that exact behaviour unexercised one round earlier, counted it
// exercised on the next, passed at exit 0, and the hidden check for it —
// `test_rich_log_expand_entries_reflow_after_min_width_change` — was red.
//
// So the door: A BEHAVIOUR IS EXERCISED BY A CHECK ONLY WHERE THE CHECK'S OWN
// ASSERTIONS NAME ONE OF THE BEHAVIOUR'S OBSERVABLES. The observables are read
// off the REQUEST — the identifiers, dotted names, keyword arguments and bound
// values the person themselves spelled — exactly as the entailment door reads
// symbols out of a citation, and the assertions are read off the file by shape
// (verify.AssertionsIn). No model has a say in either half.
//
// IT FIRES IN ONE DIRECTION AND EVERY SILENCE FAVOURS THE CHECK. A behaviour
// that names no observable is not judged here; a check this program cannot find
// or cannot parse is not judged here; and a single observable named in a single
// assertion clears the point outright. Being generous about what counts as an
// observable therefore makes the door quieter, not louder, which is why the
// reader below takes every shape it can recognise.

// how many FINDINGS are listed, where a reader is learning the shape of a gap;

// Observables are the identifiers a stated behaviour names — what a check would
// have to weigh for the behaviour to be exercised rather than merely visited.
//
// Three shapes, and every one of them is a shape rather than a vocabulary:
//
//   - a name somebody spelled DISTINCTIVELY, which is symbolsIn's own rule and
//     the identical one the entailment door opens on: `is_following_end`,
//     `RichLog.write`, `max_scroll_y`, `min_width`, `#follow-log`.
//   - a name somebody BOUND to something, which is how code spells an argument
//     and prose does not: `expand=True`, `width=40`, `follow_end(animate: bool =
//     False)`. The name is the observable; the value is what makes it one.
//   - a name of the TREE somebody spelled IN WORDS. textual s16 asked that
//     normal scrolling still update "the visible viewport and vertical scrollbar
//     position"; the run asserted `scroll_y` and `max_scroll_y` a hundred and six
//     times and never touched `ScrollBar.position`, which is precisely what the
//     two hidden checks that failed assert. "vertical scrollbar position" names
//     `ScrollBar.position` and nothing in this program could see it.
//     verify.SurfaceIndex.Spoken is that reading, against the tree's own public
//     surface and only for names that have an owner.
//
// TWO SHAPES ARE THROWN AWAY, and both because they cannot be asserted ON.
//
// A hyphen is not an identifier character in any language this program reads, so
// a token whose only separator is one is an English compound: `full-width`,
// `half-open`, `pre-fetch`. It is re-admitted where the person wrote it as a
// selector (`#follow-log`) or where the tree itself declares it, because those
// are names. Without this the door would hold every request to a word nothing
// can ever assert.
//
// And a bare TYPE name the tree declares at the top level — `RichLog`, `Log` —
// is what a check constructs, never what it weighs; the values it weighs are
// that type's members. A symbol the surface confirms as an unqualified
// declaration is dropped for that reason, and one the surface does not know is
// kept, because the request may be asking for it to exist.
//
// A behaviour that yields none of the three names nothing a check could be asked
// about — "it must post only when the boolean actually changes" is a true
// sentence with no identifier in it — and the door below stays shut on it. That
// is the same asymmetry GroundMapping keeps, for the same reason: a floor that
// refuses everything is not a floor.
