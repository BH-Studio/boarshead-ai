// ── what a repair round actually changed, and what that lets it close ────────
//
// A failed gate buys one repair, and there are two kinds. One re-runs the
// worker: it can edit files, run checks, and change what the world says. The
// other — Compose — rewrites the ACCOUNT of work that has already landed and
// runs nothing at all; its own comment says so ("the composition did none of
// it; only the words are new").
//
// The second kind was closing findings the first kind exists for. ink s5 and
// ofetch s5 both failed their gate on the substance of the work — "the missing
// element is the substance of the work: the implemented code, the branch
// created, and the confirmation that it compiles", "the missing element is the
// test results and the confirmation that pnpm test exits 0" — composed a better
// summary, were re-judged on the better summary, and settled whole at 7 of 25
// and 44 of 47 hidden checks (2026-08-29, bench/deepswe;
// docs/design/gate/SETTLEMENT.md §8).
//
// THE LAW: A REPAIR THAT DID NOT MOVE THE TREE MAY NOT CLOSE A FINDING WHOSE
// GROUND IS THE TREE OR A READING. It may still close a finding whose only
// ground is the delivered text — a wrong summary, a missing explanation — which
// is the one thing rewriting the text can honestly fix, and the case Compose was
// built for.
//
// Both halves of that sentence are measured rather than asserted. Whether the
// tree moved is a stamp of the record taken on either side of the repair.
// Whether a finding's ground is the world is read off the record too: what the
// gate settled mechanically, what the run measured, the files the finding names,
// the redness of the project's own checks, and the names the record itself uses
// for the things it ran.

// TreeStamp is the world at one moment, in the one dimension a repair round has
// to be asked about: did anything under the run's own record change?
//
// It is size and modification time per path, over the artifact record the gate
// is held to, folded to a digest. Content hashing every artifact would be the
// same answer at many times the cost — a repository's build output alone is
// megabytes — and size-and-mtime is what every build system in existence trusts
// for this question. A path that has gone missing stamps as missing, which is a
// change and the loudest kind.
//
// An empty record stamps as empty, and two empty stamps compare equal. That is
// the honest reading: a run with nothing in its record has no tree for a repair
// to move, so nothing here can convict it — and the delivered text is then the
// whole of what it produced, which is exactly the case the law leaves alone.

// GroundedInTheWorld reports whether the thing a finding points at is a thing
// only WORK could change — a file, or a check — as opposed to the account of the
// work, which writing can change.
//
// Every door below reads the RECORD and never a list of words, which is
// FAILSAFE clause 1. In order of what it costs:
//
//  1. The gate already settled it against the world. A mechanical gap asked the
//     disk for a file the plan promised; a sourced finding is a measurement the
//     run took. Neither has an opinion in it.
//  2. It names a file, under NamedFiles' own shape rule — so "docs/memo.md" is a
//     file and "the write-up" is not.
//  3. It names something the record says the run RAN. The vocabulary is the
//     record's: a project whose suite is `cargo nextest run` and one whose suite
//     is `pnpm test` are both recognised without either name appearing here.
//  4. THE RUN LEFT A TREE BEHIND AND NOTHING SAYS THE TREE IS GOOD. This is the
//     door that carries the weight, and it is written on the fail-safe side on
//     purpose. A run that produced files was doing work, not writing an answer;
//     a finding against it is a finding about that work unless the world says
//     otherwise, and the only thing that can say otherwise is the project's own
//     checks, run on the tree being handed over, coming back green. A red
//     reading is the world convicting; an ABSENT reading is nobody having
//     looked, and nobody-looked is not nothing-wrong (see store.DeliveryGate.
//     Unmeasured, which is that same rule written down one seam along).
//
// False — a finding whose only ground is the delivered text, which a rewritten
// account can honestly close — is therefore two cases, and both are ones where
// writing IS the work. A run that left nothing but its message: the message is
// the artifact, and this is §6's line reused rather than a second rule. And a
// run whose change the project's own checks pass, where what is wrong is the
// account of it: "the deliverable is a list of file paths, not the
// implementation itself" over a green suite is exactly what revision.Compose was
// built for.
