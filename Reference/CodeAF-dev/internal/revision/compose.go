// COMPOSING IS NOT RE-EXECUTING.
//
// A delivery gate that fails a finished coding leaf used to buy exactly one
// thing: another run of the whole worker, with the critique appended to its
// task. For a worker whose deliverable is prose, that is the right purchase —
// the thing that was wrong is the thing being remade.
//
// For a worker whose deliverable is a CHANGE, it is close to the worst purchase
// available, and it was measured being made. The gap was about the wording of
// the summary; the change had already landed on the shared workspace; the
// leaf's own view had been removed with its checkpoint in it, so the second run
// started from a tree where the fix was already in and its baseline was already
// green. It found nothing to do — 23 model calls, zero edits — spent 80% of the
// leaf's whole bill doing it, and then, because the second run's outcome
// replaced the first's wholesale, delivered an account with the checks in it and
// not one file row, having discarded the pass that actually did the work.
//
// And it cost parallelism twice over: a second engine run holds a leaf's slot
// for its full duration, and its landing takes the shared working tree's lease,
// which every sibling view's landing waits on.
//
// So when the work is done and the WORDS are what failed, the words are what is
// bought. One text-only call, handed the substrate account, the patch, and the
// worker's own last word, writing the deliverable the person will read. No
// process, no workspace, no landing, no lease — and nothing that could touch the
// tree, which is what makes it safe to say the change is unaffected.
//
// The judgement of which case this is deliberately reads no prose. It is three
// facts about the worker and the work: the worker's product is a change
// ([exec.Mutates]), the change is in the repository ([exec.Account.Landed]), and
// the work's own checks settled ([exec.Account.Verified]). A gap naming work
// that is not done cannot satisfy all three, because the work is not there to be
// found.

// composePrompt writes one deliverable from a finished change.
//
// It is deliberately not a repair prompt. The model is not being asked to fix
// anything, argue with a reviewer, or describe what a previous attempt got
// wrong: it is being handed a completed piece of work and the evidence of it,
// and asked for the account of that work the person will read. The review's
// wording rides in only as what the account must cover.
const composePrompt = `You are writing the account of a piece of software work that is FINISHED.

The change is already made. It is committed, its own checks have been run, and
the diff below is exactly what is in the repository. Nothing you write changes
any of that, and you are not being asked to change any of it.

What is missing is the account of it — what the person who asked will read.

Write that account. It stands entirely on its own: the person has not seen a
previous draft, has not read the review, and is not interested in either. Do not
mention the review, the gaps, an earlier attempt, or the fact that anything was
rewritten.

Every factual claim you make must come from the record below and from nothing
else. The diff is the whole of what changed and it is the only thing that can
settle WHY it changed: if you state a root cause, a mechanism, or a reason, the
lines that show it must be in that diff, and you should be able to point at them.
Where the record does not settle something the account would otherwise want to
say, say that the record does not name it. That sentence is always available to
you and it is always the right answer for a fact you do not have — an
illustration, a plausible example, or an inference from the fact that the tests
now pass is a false statement about somebody's repository, and is worse than the
gap it fills.

Write prose the person can act on. No preamble, no headings unless the material
genuinely has sections, no restatement of the request.`

// Composition is one composed deliverable and what it cost. Text empty means
// nothing was composed and the caller keeps what it had — which is the only
// failure mode here, and it is deliberately not an error: a compose that cannot
// be reached must leave a finished, landed, verified piece of work delivered.
