package run

// A PROGRAM CODEAF CARRIES IS ONE MORE WORKER KIND. A program that does a
// whole task on its own — senior-dev first (internal/delegate,
// docs/design/delegate/PROTOCOL.md) — is seated on a task exactly where the
// bash worker is: it reads the same context for its limits, banks its dollars
// into the same account, publishes the same live step, appends to the same
// trajectory, and comes home with the same Report. Nothing above the factory
// knows which kind ran.
//
// What differs is inside: there is no model turn here. The program runs as a
// child process of codeaf's own executable (`codeaf <name> run --json …`) in
// the run's folder (for a program that edits files, the person's folder itself,
// readied by internal/session's PrepareProgramFolder), its stdout is the
// records, and its terminal record is the ending. Every stage, step and ending
// is written to the task's action log (delegate.ActionsFile) the moment it is
// received, which is what the task page draws the program's work from; its
// `step` records are also what enter the trajectory, so the task page's step
// count is what the program said it did and not how many phases it announced;
// and the live step names the step of the program's process it is in.
//
// ── ITS ONLY ROAD TO A MODEL IS THIS RUN'S MODEL API ────────────────────────
//
// Before the program starts, the worker opens the run's model API
// (internal/provider/modelapi) on this machine's loopback and hands the child
// its address and token and nothing else (delegate.ChildEnv): no provider key
// is inherited by the program, and its model-written shell loses the loopback token.
// Every call it makes goes through the conversation's own
// completer, is refused at the run's dollar ceiling before it is made, and is
// written to the task's conversation log as one turn. The API is closed the
// moment the program has exited, and the token dies with it.
//
// ── MONEY IS METERED BY THE API, NEVER REPORTED BY THE PROGRAM ──────────────
//
// Each call's price reaches four books as it is metered ([delegateMeter]):
// the conversation's own, which folds the call whole — tokens, model and
// dollars — without writing a ledger row of its own (internal/session's
// beltFold); the run's live bank, which the supervisor holds to the ceiling;
// the task's spend rows, one per call, which the task page draws; and this
// machine's spending ledger, one row per call, exactly once, filed under the
// conversation and the task.
// The program's terminal record may still carry its own reading of what it
// spent; that figure is kept on the record and never banked.
