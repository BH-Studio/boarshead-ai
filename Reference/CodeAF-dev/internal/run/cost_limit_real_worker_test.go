// TestCostRemainderEndsARealBashWorker holds the worker-side acceptance behind
// the conversation door's RunSpec test: a conversation that has spent $1.50 of
// its $2 --max-cost hands this run $0.50. The real BashWorker pays $0.25 on
// each scripted seat call, reports those calls while it is working, and the
// existing limit road cancels and absorbs its return at the remainder. The seat
// has no artificial delay: the live spend notification lets the limit cancel
// the worker before another
// provider call, making the boundary deterministic without a sleep.
