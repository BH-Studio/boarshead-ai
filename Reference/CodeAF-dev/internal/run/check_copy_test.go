// TestCheckWorkerIsToldTheWorkIsInItsOwnCopy is the fresh-install checker that
// began with `cd /tmp/fxfresh/repo`: nothing in its opening said where the work
// was, so it decoded the person's checkout out of the project folder's name,
// read that tree's unrelated diff, and was moved home only when a write there
// was refused. The opening a check really gets — built by the run's own worker
// seat, from a check the review round's store door seated — must say the work
// is in its own working directory and that the person's checkout is not it.
