// WHICH MODEL RUNS A TASK IS THE CREW'S ANSWER, NOT THE RUN'S. Every store
// task carries a role — the seat its shape or its own declaration gives it, read
// off the store at the moment it is asked (internal/plandb's RoleOf) — and this
// file is the one place that turns that role into the model the task's worker is
// built on. The crew the profile holds ([config.TierSeatAt]) is what answers, so
// a preset, a row pinned by hand and a tuned row all decide which model sits in
// a seat, and the run itself names no model of its own.
//
// THE SEAT A PERSON NAMED IS THE SEAT EVERY LAUNCH TAKES, WAKES INCLUDED. The
// two seats a door resolves for a run — the work seat and the plan seat
// ([config.ResolveSeats]) — ride here as [Seats], because a run does not launch
// once: the root is woken again to fold a child it split, a planner adds a leaf
// mid-run, and every one of those launches seats a task the door never saw. So
// the factory is HANDED the seats the door already climbed and reads them for
// the two tiers they name, rather than asking the profile again for a row the
// person overrode with a flag. THE CHECK RIDES THE CAREFUL WORK TIER ([SeatFor]),
// so a check the review round adds after the launch still takes the profile seat.
// The probe row has no door flag, nothing names it, so it still
// comes from the profile's tiers, and an empty seat falls exactly where an empty
// tier always fell.
//
// UNDER `--one-model` THE PROFILE DOES NOT ANSWER. A conversation started with
// the flag names its own model as every seat ([Seats.One]), and the factory
// seats every role on it without reading a crew row or the check seat's
// environment rung: the flag promises every text call rides the model the
// person is talking to, and a crew row answering for an empty seat is how a
// run under it once billed two models nobody named.
//
// THE READ IS AT LAUNCH, NEVER CACHED. The factory asks the profile again for
// every task it seats — for the check and probe rows, and for any seat the door
// left empty — so a crew change between two launches (a /crew run in the
// conversation, a tuned row landing, a row pinned by hand) is seen by the next
// worker launched rather than frozen into the moment the run began.

// is the door's own three way answer ([config.CheckSeat]), carried here as
// Check: the check flag the person typed, else the plan flag they typed, else
// empty. A check rides the careful work tier ([SeatFor]), and an EMPTY Check
// is the door having named no check model, which falls the way an empty tier
// always fell: the profile's careful row, the crew's checker. The small row a

//
// THE ROLE IS READ FROM THE STORE, NOT FROM THE TASK HANDED OVER. [SeatFor] is
// handed [plandb.Store.RoleOf]'s answer, so a leaf that split mid-work seats as a
// planner for its coordinating turns without a word on the task being rewritten,

// THE PROFILE ANSWERS THE MODEL, through [config.TierSeatAt], the same read a

// it came from, but only the model travels here, because a worker is built at a
// path that has no surface to print the rung on. completerFor builds the seat's
// provider from the resolved model — a run hands the door's own, and a test
// records which model it was asked for.
//
// A TIER WITH NO MODEL FALLS TO THE WORKER ROW, and a worker row that is empty
// too is a task no model can run: the factory answers a worker that refuses
// rather than one built on an empty model, and its error names the tier, because
// the row a person has to go and fill is the one the message says. Empty here is
// not the same as never held: [config.TierSeatAt] answers this build's default
