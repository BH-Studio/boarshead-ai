package run

// The chat's task door reaches this engine through an interface the session
// package owns ([session.RunEngine]), because this package is built ON the
// session package — its crew seats every task in [session.NewBeltWorker] and its
// landing is [session.LandRunTree] — so a door there that imported this one would
// be the cycle the compiler refuses. This file is the other end of that seam: it
// states [Start] and [Land] in the session's own words and installs the engine at
// load, so a binary that links this package gets the run road and one that does
// not gets the door it always had.
