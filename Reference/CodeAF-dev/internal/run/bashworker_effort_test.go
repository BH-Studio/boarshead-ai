// THE EFFORT HALF OF THE RUN WORKER, read at the seam the seat's provider
// stands on. A run worker is a bash-belt worker, and its belt answers one
// action per response — so the seat is the work seat (internal/session's
// NewBeltWorker sets effort.RoleWork) whose floor is low, and the rung the
// ladder resolves is stamped onto the request context (internal/session's
// loop stamps provider.WithConfiguredEffortRung per attempt) before it reaches
// the provider. The fake completer is the provider here, so the context it is
// handed is the whole of what the seat asked for.
