// slot bound can have more workers out than the channel has room for, and a
// worker blocked on handing its return in never reaches Done; waiting first
// would wait forever. Reading first is right on a bounded run too, where it

// endRootOn writes the run's own ending on its root task when the run ended on

// set, its own worker failing, a review it could not seat, or the caller's
// deadline. The store's verb is [plandb.Store.EndRoot], which fails the root and
// cancels whatever is still open under it, and a root the run already ended —
// completed, or stopped by a person — is left exactly as it ended.
//
// EVERY ENDING WRITES THE ROOT'S ENDING, OR THE NEXT REQUEST ADOPTS IT. Only a
// person's stop and the tree's own completion used to write one, so a run that
// hit its dollar limit, whose root worker failed or whose caller's timeout ran
// out stayed `running` in its store, and the next hand-off over the same store
// found a live run and took it for its own.
//
// A CONTEXT SOMEBODY CANCELLED IS THE ONE ENDING LEFT OPEN, ON PURPOSE. It is a
// conversation closing, a process told to stop, or a person's stop that has
// already written its own ending before it cut the context — and the first two
// are not the run's ending at all: nothing decided anything about the work, and
// every step it took is in the store. A store left open that way is work nothing
// is driving, which is what `interrupted` means, and the doors that open a store
// set such a run aside as interrupted rather than adopting it
// ([session.OpenRunPlan]). A DEADLINE IS NOT THAT: it is a time bound the caller
// set, and it ends the run the way the run's own time limit does.
