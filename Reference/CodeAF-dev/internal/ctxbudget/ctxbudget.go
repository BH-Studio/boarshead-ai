// Package ctxbudget is the one place that turns a model's context window into
// byte and token budgets. The law it implements: an agent — head turn, planner
// pass, leaf worker, judge — may fill its window to FillPercent (60% by
// default) before compaction fires, and it always keeps CompletionReserve
// tokens of room for the answer and its reasoning. Nothing downstream of this
// package may carry an absolute byte ceiling of its own: every cap is either a
// Budget, a Share of one, or an explicitly-named fallback for the case where
// the window is unknown.
//
// Two clauses govern material an agent re-sends rather than material it sends
// once. WithinWorkingSet takes the fill percentage of min(window, working-set
// ceiling), because a window is what a provider accepts and not evidence that
// carrying that much is useful. ReuseCeiling bounds the SUM over turns of what
// was sent, which is the quantity a runaway loop actually moves and the one a
// per-turn window and a cache-discounted spend meter both structurally cannot
// see. Both are opt-in, both go inert on an unknown window.
//
// The package deliberately imports nothing from the rest of the tree. Callers
// hand it the window size (the surface owns the catalog and hands facts down,
// the same doctrine as Linear.WithContextLength); zero means unknown, and
// unknown is never treated as small — every consumer names its own fallback.
