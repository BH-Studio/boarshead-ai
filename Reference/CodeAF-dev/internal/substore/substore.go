// Package substore is where subharness bundles live on disk.
//
// PRD §6 and §7. One directory per subharness under the state root, immutable
// version pages inside it, and the two mutable notes a subharness accumulates —
// what it has learnt, and how its last run went — beside them:
//
//	~/.codeaf/subharnesses/<name>/v1.json      the version record: hash, parent, why
//	~/.codeaf/subharnesses/<name>/v1/          the bundle that record describes
//	                              manifest.json
//	                              program.js
//	                              prompts/*.md
//	                              memory.md      the seed this version was minted with
//	                              evals/         inert until v3; the format exists now
//	~/.codeaf/subharnesses/<name>/v2.json
//	~/.codeaf/subharnesses/<name>/v2/
//	~/.codeaf/subharnesses/<name>/memory.md    the LIVE memory, written by remember()
//	~/.codeaf/subharnesses/<name>/last-run.json
//	~/.codeaf/subharnesses/<name>/.mint.lock   the gate one mint at a time holds
//
// THERE IS NO HEAD FILE. The head is the highest version present, which is the
// rule internal/subharness/store.go states about its own pages and the reason it
// has never had a pointer that could disagree with what it pointed at.
//
// THE RECORD IS A FILE BESIDE THE DIRECTORY, NOT A FILE INSIDE IT, and that is
// the whole of how a version is claimed. os.Link cannot claim a directory, so
// the exclusive-create discipline this package inherited would have had nothing
// to grip if the record lived under v2/. Written beside it, `v2.json` is exactly
// the page the old store already minted this way: the first writer to link it
// into place owns v2, a second writer racing it is told the name is taken —
// refused, never shifted along to v3, for the reason [Store.write] gives — and
// the bundle directory is renamed into place only by the winner.
// See [Store.Mint].
//
// THE CLAIM IS NOT ON ITS OWN ENOUGH, and that is what `.mint.lock` is for. An
// exclusive create refuses two writers who computed the SAME version number, and
// two writers who read the store a moment apart do not: one of them counts past
// a record whose bundle has not landed yet and mints a second child of the same
// parent. [Store.gated] holds one writer at a time across the whole
// read-check-claim so that cannot be read a moment apart, and the exclusive
// create stays underneath it as the floor on a filesystem that will not lock.
//
// THE HOLD IS TAKEN UNDER A DEADLINE AND NEVER SIMPLY WAITED FOR. A mint that
// finds the gate held for the whole of [mintGateBound] is refused with
// [ErrMintBusy] rather than parked behind it, because a caller drawing to a
// person can survive a refusal and cannot survive a wait — see [Store.gated].
//
// The store holds no cache. A bundle is small, read at launch and at dispatch,
// and edited by hand often enough that a stale read would be the more expensive
// mistake — the same judgement the harness store made, for the same reason.
