// Bundle is one version of one subharness, whole, in memory.
//
// PROVISIONAL, AND FLAGGED AS SUCH. The runtime lane owns what a bundle has to
// carry in order to be run, and at the time this was written its worktree had no
// Bundle type of its own to code against. This is the store's honest answer to
// "what is on disk": the manifest, the program, the prompts every ai() call site
// names, the memory door, and the eval names that are inert until v3. If the
// runtime landed a different shape, [Build] is the seam where the two meet — the
// coordinator points it at an adapter, or this type moves into internal/exec
// beside the interface it feeds. Nothing else in this package depends on the
// field list.
type Bundle struct {
	// Name and Version are the identity. Version is the version this bundle
	// actually is, never the head at the time it was asked for, so a runner that

	// this struct did not read — an eval, an attachment a program writes beside
	// its prompts — starts here rather than rebuilding the layout.

	// Manifest is the bundle's manifest.json, validated. Its Provenance is
	// whatever the file claimed and means nothing: the registry stamps that field
	// from the layer the bundle was found at, which is the law
	// exec.Manifest.Provenance states.

	// Prompts is prompts/*.md by the name an ai() call site refers to them by —
	// the file's own name, "weekly-brief.md", not a path. Every ai() call names
	// one of these (PRD §6) and a promptRef that is not a key here is a bundle
	// that will fail at the call rather than at the load, because the store
	// cannot know which refs the program will reach.

	// Evals names the checks in evals/, sorted. INERT UNTIL v3 and present from
	// v1 on purpose (PRD §6): the slot and the directory exist so that the

	// Nothing in this build reads one.

// encodeManifest writes a manifest document the way every one on disk is
// written: indented, newline-terminated, so that a person editing a bundle by
// hand and `git diff` over a project store both get something readable.
//
// THE BYTES ARE THE VERSION'S IDENTITY, so this function is the one place they
// are produced. A second spelling of the same manifest — different indentation,
// no trailing newline — would hash differently and mint a version in which
// nothing changed.
//
// One consequence worth stating rather than discovering. exec.Schema is the
// bytes a schema was written as, and indenting the document it rides in
// RE-INDENTS IT: a schema handed to [Store.Mint] compact comes back off disk
// spaced out. The schema's CONTENT is untouched — every key, every value, every
// order — and the encoding is a FIXED POINT, so minting a bundle that was loaded
// from this store produces the identical bytes and therefore the identical hash.
// That fixed point is the property content-addressing actually needs; byte-exact
// preservation of an author's whitespace is not, and buying it would cost the
// format its readability, which PRD §7's whole org-sharing story is built on.

// — are never re-encoded and are byte-identical, always.
