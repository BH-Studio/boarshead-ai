// Build turns a loaded bundle into the thing that runs it. It is the runtime
// lane's door into this package and the only one.

// THE STORE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT JAVASCRIPT IS. PRD §3 says there is ONE generic
// Go runner parameterized by a bundle, not one runner per bundle, and this
// function type is that sentence written as a signature: the store's whole job
// is to hand it a [Bundle], and everything about goja, fuel, guards and the
// deopt is on the other side of it.

// Source is this store seen as a place the registry loads bundles from —
// exec.BundleSource, and the door in is Registry.UseBundles(layer, source).
//
// A STORE WITH NO RUNTIME IS NOT A SOURCE AT ALL, which is why this returns a
// nil interface when handed no builder rather than a source whose every lookup
// fails. That is the codebase's law about a capability that cannot work stated
// at the earliest possible place: a build with no JavaScript runtime in it
// offers no bundles, so a person is shown nothing about them instead of a list
// of names that refuse to run. Registry.UseBundles takes a nil source as a
// no-op, so the wiring reads the same either way:
//
//	registry.UseBundles(exec.LayerHome, substore.Home().Source(runtime.Build))

//
// IT IS ASKED, NEVER SCANNED, and it holds no cache — which is exec.BundleSource's
// own account of why it is shaped this way, and it is the right trade here: a
// store that had cached a listing would run a version the person had just
// replaced. Not found is (nil, false) and is not an error; it is the next
// layer's turn. A bundle that is THERE and does not load is also (nil, false),
// with a line in the journal, because a person who typed a name is better served
// by "no subharness by that name" than by a runner that fails at its first host
// call.

// where somebody learns their disk is broken, and a row that cannot be picked is
// worse than no row, because it is a promise the surface behind it cannot keep.
// The journal line is what makes the absence findable.
//
// A store that cannot be read at all answers nothing, which exec.BundleSource
// asks for by name: a registry is not worth failing a launch over.
