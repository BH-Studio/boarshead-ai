// Mint writes a new version of a subharness. It is the only door that writes a
// bundle, and it validates before it writes anything at all, so every version a
// reader finds is one the runtime can be handed.
//
// VERSIONS ARE MINTED, NEVER CHOSEN (PRD §6). The caller does not say which
// version it is making; it says which version it MADE THIS FROM, by that
// version's hash, and one line of why. That is optimistic concurrency in its
// smallest honest form: a design flow that read v2, thought for a minute and
// came back to save finds out here that somebody else saved v3 in the meantime,
// instead of silently minting a v4 that threw their work away.
//
//   - parent empty, nothing on disk: this is v1.
//   - parent empty, versions on disk: refused. Say what this came from.
//   - parent is the head's hash, and the content is the head's content: nothing
//     changed, so nothing is minted and the head is returned. Minting is
//     IDEMPOTENT, which is what "content-addressed" has to mean for a flow that
//     re-saves an unedited bundle.
//   - parent is the head's hash, content differs: v(head+1), recording the
//     parent hash and the why.
//   - parent is anything else: refused, naming the head it disagrees with.
//   - two mints racing: exactly one wins and every loser is refused, never
//     shifted along to the next number. A loser normally reads the winner's
//     version and is told its parent has moved on; where the gate could not be
//     taken it gets as far as the claim and is told [ErrExists]. See
//     [Store.gated] for how the race is decided and [Store.write] for why a
//     retry would write a lineage that lies.
//
// A CALLER ON A TURN PATH GETS AN ANSWER WITHIN [mintGateBound], NEVER A WAIT:
// a mint that cannot have the gate inside that bound is refused with
// [ErrMintBusy] and has written nothing, so the caller may say so, or mint
// again, but it never blocks a turn on somebody else's lock.
//
// Content that an ANCESTOR once had is still a new version. A revert is a real
// event with its own place in the lineage, and collapsing it onto the version it
// restored would move the head backwards — which is the one thing the
// no-head-file rule cannot survive.

// gated runs fn holding the exclusive right to add a version to one subharness.
//
// THE READ AND THE CLAIM ARE ONE STEP OR THEY ARE NOTHING. [Store.claim] counts
// the next version from the RECORDS — a version is spent the instant its record
// file is linked — and checks the parent against the HEAD, which is the highest
// version whose bundle is also on disk. [Store.write] links the record first and
// renames the bundle into place second, so for the width of that rename v2 is a
// spent number to the count and no version at all to the check. A writer the
// scheduler drops into that window reads "the head is still v1" and "the next
// number is 3", passes a parent check that went stale a microsecond ago, claims
// a number nobody is fighting it for, and mints a SECOND CHILD OF v1 — the
// forked lineage the refusal in [Store.write] exists to prevent. That refusal
// cannot see it: an exclusive create only catches two writers who computed the
// same number. So the window is closed here instead, by letting one writer at a
// time hold the whole read-check-claim.
//
// The gate is also what makes a record with no bundle DECIDABLE. Held, such a
// record can only be a mint whose process died, never one in flight, which is
// exactly the reading [Store.Versions] and the count already take: the number
// stays spent, the next mint goes one further along, and nothing waits on a
// writer that is never coming back. A lock the kernel drops when a process dies
// is the only claim that can say that.
//
// A GATE THAT CANNOT BE TAKEN IS NOT A REASON TO REFUSE A MINT. A read-only
// directory, a filesystem with no advisory locking: fn still runs, with the
// exclusive create in [Store.write] as the floor it has always been. That is the
// same trade internal/lane makes over its beliefs, for the same reason.
//
// A GATE SOMEBODY ELSE IS HOLDING IS A DIFFERENT ANSWER ENTIRELY, AND IT IS A
// REFUSAL RATHER THAN A WAIT. The acquire is non-blocking, retried under
// [mintGateBound], and gives up with [ErrMintBusy]; it does NOT fall through and
// run fn unlocked, because running unlocked is the forked lineage this gate was
// built to close, and it does not block, because a blocking file lock with no
// deadline is exactly the shape that silenced a turn for twenty-nine minutes in
// #264. Mint has no caller on a turn path today; the bound is here so that the
// first one cannot inherit the freeze. The two answers are told apart by
