// Memory is one subharness's accumulated domain notes — the backing for the
// runtime's remember() and recall(), which are exec.Env.Remember and
// exec.Env.Recall.
//
// IT IS SCOPED TO THE NAME AND NOT TO THE VERSION, and that is a decision worth
// being explicit about because PRD §6 draws memory.md inside the version
// directory. Both halves of that are kept and neither is bent: the version's
// memory.md is the SEED the bundle was minted with, immutable like everything
// else in a version page, and the file a run actually appends to lives one level
// up, beside the versions. Anything else would make a version mutable — which is
// the rule the whole store is built on — or would throw a subharness's learning
// away every time somebody minted a new version of it, which is exactly the
// thing accumulated domain notes exist not to do.
//
// The file is markdown because a person reads it. It is the same file whether it
// was written by a run, by an editor, or by a `git pull` over a project store.
//
// [Memory.Remember] and [Memory.Recall] TAKE A CONTEXT THEY BARELY USE, and
// that is deliberate: they are exec.Env.Remember and exec.Env.Recall, spelled
// the way the contract spells them, so the runtime hands this value straight to
// a bundle instead of wrapping it in an adapter whose only job is to drop an
// argument. An interface a store satisfies by having the methods is one nobody
// has to keep in sync.
