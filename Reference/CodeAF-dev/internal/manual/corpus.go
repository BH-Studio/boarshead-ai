// A CORPUS IS ONE PRODUCT'S ACCOUNT OF ITSELF, and this file is the machinery
// every corpus shares: the split into sections, the scorer, and the derived
// vocabulary that makes a self-question recognizable.
//
// There are two corpora in this binary because there are two products in it.
// The resident (internal/head, internal/tui) is an employee that keeps working
// while nobody is watching; the v3 chat (internal/tui3, internal/session) is a
// conversation you sit in front of. They share a repository and almost nothing
// else — different surfaces, different vocabulary, different laws about what is
// even possible. ONE POOL WOULD ANSWER BOTH QUESTIONS WRONG: a chat asked "what
// can you do" would quote the resident's standing watches, and a resident asked
// the same would quote slash commands it does not have. So each product indexes
// its own folder, and neither can reach the other's pages.
//
// The scoring is deliberately plain — ordinary Okapi BM25 over a few dozen short
// sections. Nothing here is tuned, because a corpus this small is retrieved
// exactly by the words its headings are written with, and a clever ranker would
// be a second thing to keep honest.

	// topicWeight is how many times a page's own `# ` title counts in every

	// split hands it to the preamble section, and a page whose `# ` line is
	// followed straight by a `## ` line has no preamble — which is every page
	// in chat/. A count found the chat corpus's page titles carried by 0 of its
	// 1029 sections, so a person who named the topic ("the screen is blank",
	// "who can see my files") could only be matched by whichever section
	// happened to repeat the word, and a long page has more sections in which
	// to repeat it by accident. One is enough: the title counts like a body
	// word, which lifts a page that is on topic without letting a long one win
	// a question it does not answer. Measured on plainquestions_test.go's
	// twenty-five, the right page came first 11 times and was among the four
	// sections 17 times before this and 14 and 20 after, with no probe in
	// chat_test.go moved; on the held-out twenty-two, 6/15 before and 7/17
