// ── THE CHAT MAY NOT TEACH AN EXIT LADDER THE BINARY STOPPED USING ─────────
//
// There were THREE exit tables in this product and two of them meant opposite
// things by the same number. They were pulled onto one ladder in
// `cmd/codeaf/envelope.go`, `docs/HEADLESS.md` was rewritten, and the terminal
// page in this corpus was written against the new one — and a FOURTH copy was
// left standing here, on `adaptive-runs`, still telling a person that `codeaf
// exec` has "a six-rung ladder" and that "`5` is the one to watch for".
//
// That copy is the worst of the four, because this corpus is the ONLY
// authoritative source about codeaf for the model: the running chat answers
// "what does exit 5 mean" out of these pages, and the answer it had was a
// number the binary no longer returns. A page that is complete, well-written
// and WRONG outranks the model's own uncertainty.
//
// SO THE RUNGS ARE READ OUT OF THE CODE. The page has to carry every number
// [exitLadder] actually publishes, spelled in the words that table spells it,
// and none of the sentences the retired six-code table was written in. Reading
// the composite literal with go/parser is also what puts this law on the
// pull-request gate — scripts/laws.sh finds the laws by that import.
