# The debug record

## How do I see what happened — turning the record on with /debug, --debug or CODEAF_DEBUG

When a turn goes wrong and the answer is not in what you can see, you can ask codeaf to
keep the **debug record** of a run: everything that run did, in a folder of its own. There
is one switch and three ways to say it, and they all mean the same thing.

```
/debug                            in a conversation, from here to the end of it
codeaf chat --debug               and the same flag on `codeaf do` and `codeaf exec`
CODEAF_DEBUG=1 codeaf             for one shell, one run
```

`CODEAF_CALL_LOG_BODIES=1` — the older word, if it is the one in your shell history —
means the same thing now.

**A recording launch keeps its conversation in this terminal.** The record is written by
the process that makes the calls, and ordinarily `codeaf` hands your conversation to this
folder's background session host — which was never told to record, and would leave you a
folder holding `run.json` and no request bodies at all. So a run that is recording takes
the in-process road, by the pin exactly as by the flag. The conversation ends with the
terminal, the way `--no-host` does.

**It does not change what the run does.** Nothing is asked differently, nothing is slower,
no model is told anything new. With it off, a run costs one check and writes nothing at
all; that is why it is safe to leave the flag out and reach for it only on the day you
need it.

**`/debug` cannot be turned off again.** You type it because something has already gone
wrong, and a switch you could turn back off would only ever leave you half a record — the
half after the thing you were trying to catch. It lasts for the rest of the conversation,
and the next one starts with it off.

`/debug` answers with the folder either way: the first time it says
`recording this conversation · it goes to …`, and a second time
`the record is already on · it goes to …`.

## Does /debug turn the record on for my other conversations — what each door covers

The three doors mean the same record and not the same reach. **With the pin or the flag,
every conversation this process holds is recorded, each into its own folder; `/debug`
records only the conversation you typed it in.** The pin and the flag were handed to that
codeaf on purpose, before anything opened; `/debug` was typed inside one conversation, and
one codeaf can be holding several.

So if you have two conversations open and type `/debug` in one, the other one keeps
writing nothing — its prompts, its files and its replies do not land in a folder its
person never asked for. Each conversation that is being recorded has a folder of its own,
named by its own run.

Where the pin or the flag already turned everything on, `/debug` says so rather than
pretending it did something: `the record is already on for every conversation this codeaf
holds · this one goes to …`, naming your own conversation's folder. And in a conversation
that belongs to no run at all, it says `this conversation has no run to record.` instead
of switching on a record that would go nowhere.

## Where is the debug record — the folder for a run, and what is in it

Every run gets a folder of its own, named after that run:

```
~/.codeaf/logs/trace/<run>/
```

`<run>` is sixteen characters minted when the run starts — when you open a conversation,
and when `codeaf do` or `codeaf exec` begins. It is the id every record in that folder
carries, so records from two runs can never be read as one.

Under `CODEAF_HOME` the folder moves with everything else codeaf keeps.

**The folder holds the record of that run, and the first thing in it is `run.json`** —
written the moment the run starts, and saying which door opened it (`chat`, `resume`,
`do`, `exec`), which model was asked for, which build of codeaf this was, which folder the
run was pointed at, and when it began. It is the file that tells you which run a folder
you found afterwards actually was.

Beside it the run's own records accumulate: `events.jsonl`, one line per thing that
happened, and a `calls/` folder with one file per model call named by that call's id.
Every record carries the run it belongs to, and — where the work it came from has a name —
the piece of work, so a long run reads as the plan it was rather than a pile of calls in
time order.

**With the switch on, those files fill as the run happens.** Each model call writes its
request and its answer under `calls/`. Each tool call — including one a door refused
before it ran — appends a line to `events.jsonl`. So does each choice the run made: which
machine was asked first, whether a slow answer got a second machine, and how hard the
model was asked to think. A run that called nothing still has `run.json`, so a folder you
found afterwards still says which run it was.

Each of the three doors also prints one line to the error output when it finishes, and
only when there is something to go and look at:

```
debug record: ~/.codeaf/logs/trace/52dfbdde3f1a7c04
```

**With the switch off, nothing is created at all** — no folder, no line, nothing to clean
up afterwards.

## Why did that call fail — the request, the answer and the choice

With the debug record on, the answer is in the run's folder. `calls/<id>.json` is that
one model call whole: the request that went out, the answer that came back, the
endpoint's own sentence if it failed, and the thinking text where the endpoint sent it
separately. `events.jsonl` is the rest of the turn in order — each tool that ran, failed
or was refused, and each routing, hedge and effort choice, with the reason it was made.

A tool a door refused is recorded as refused, not as failed, and the line names who
said no — `approval`, `write-scope`, `task-ground` — in their own words. A hedge that did
not fire is recorded as loudly as one that did: both are the same choice answered two
ways, and a turn that waited ninety seconds with nothing saying why is the folder this
exists to prevent.

The **model-call log** is still there and still always on: `codeaf logs` prints the last
calls with the status each came back with, the provider's own first sentence on a
failure, how long it took and what it cost. What the log holds is the **shape** of a
call — how many messages, how many tools, which ceiling, which provider — and not what you
wrote. The old `CODEAF_CALL_LOG_BODIES` pin still adds the whole request and reply to each
line of `calls.jsonl` as well as turning the debug record on. With that pin on, the live
file is allowed 256 MB (32 MB without it). The bodies also live in the run's folder now,
which is where they were always meant to live, so the file you grep can stay small.

## Is my key in the debug record — what it never holds

**No key, ever.** Nothing that looks like a credential is written into the record: an
authorization or `api-key` field, anything after `Bearer`, and anything shaped like an
`sk-…` token are each replaced by the word `[redacted]` before anything reaches the disk.

**And not only the shapes.** Every credential this machine is actually configured with —
the model key, the search keys, an application secret you pasted for your own Google
registration — is handed to the record by name as the run opens, and is replaced wherever
it appears, whatever it looks like. That matters because a key with no recognisable shape
at all (a Google `AIza…`, a Groq `gsk_…`, the plain token a self-hosted endpoint was
given) can come back inside a provider's own error message. You can grep the folder for
`authorization` or for your own key and find nothing.

**Everything else in it is yours.** The record is built to hold what you wrote, what your
files say and what the model answered — that is the point of it — so the folder is
readable by you and nobody else on the machine (the folder is `0700`, its files `0600`),
it never leaves the state root, and nothing is sent anywhere. Treat a folder you attach to
a bug report the way you would treat the conversation itself.

## How much does the debug record keep — the size law, and what happens when it fills

Two ceilings, and both are about never losing the run you are looking at.

- **256 MB per run.** When a run's folder reaches it, the record writes one last line
  saying it was capped and stops. It keeps everything it already had rather than making
  room by dropping the start of the run — which is where the choice that went wrong
  usually is.
- **20 runs kept.** When a new run opens its folder and there are more than twenty, the
  oldest whole folders are removed until twenty remain. A run is kept complete or not at
  all; nothing is ever deleted from inside a run that is still going. **A run that is
  still going is never removed either**, however low you set the count — retention is a
  rule about runs that are over, so a second conversation opening cannot delete the record
  of the one you are debugging.

Both move for one shell when you need them to:

```
CODEAF_TRACE_MAX_MB=1024 codeaf chat --debug     a bigger ceiling for one run
CODEAF_TRACE_KEEP=3 codeaf chat --debug          keep fewer folders around
```

If the record cannot be written at all — a full disk, a folder that is not writable —
codeaf says so once on the error output, naming the path, and the run carries on exactly
as it would have with the record off. **A record that cannot be written is never a failed
run.**
