# Making pictures, audio and video

codeaf can produce media as well as read it: a picture from a description, a
spoken audio file from text, a piece of music from a brief, a short video from a
prompt. Each one is a tool on the list, each one costs money, and each one saves
a file and tells you where it went.

**These tools are only there when a model behind them is.** codeaf resolves one
model per kind of media — drawing, speaking, composing, filming — from your
settings, and a kind with no model available simply has no tool, rather than a
tool that refuses. So `generate_image`, `speak`, `generate_music` and
`generate_video` may each be present or absent independently, and asking for one
that is absent gets you an honest "I do not have that here" rather than a failed
attempt.

**All four work in tasks, in adaptive runs and inside saved harnesses**, not only
in this conversation — see "Can a task or a harness make media?" below.

## Can you draw me a picture or make an image?

Yes, with `generate_image`, when a drawing model is available.

Arguments: `prompt` (required), `reference_paths`, `aspect_ratio`, `size`, `path`,
`model`.

The picture is written to a file, and the result codeaf reads is one line naming
it — **the whole path, absolute, from the root** — like:

```
/home/you/work/.codeaf/images/20260817-142201-sunset-over-the-harbour.png — 1024×1024 png, 1.4MB, generated on <model>
```

The file suffix follows the image bytes. If a provider returns JPEG bytes for a
path ending in `.png`, codeaf changes the saved name to `.jpg` and reports that
actual path, so the name and the file agree.

The path is whole because that line is what you are shown in place of the
picture on a terminal that cannot draw one, and a path relative to a directory
you are not standing in is a path you cannot open.

The image itself never enters the conversation, because a picture carried in the
transcript is re-sent on every step of every turn afterwards. If codeaf needs to
look at what it made, it opens the file like any other picture. **You do not
have to open the file yourself** — see the next section.

Leave `path` out and the name is a timestamp plus a few words of your prompt,
saved where this session keeps its pictures. Give `path` and you choose the name
and folder; an existing file there is overwritten, exactly as `write` would.

`aspect_ratio` (for example `16:9`) and `size` (for example `1024x1024`) are
passed to the image model untouched. Leave them out for its own default.

## Do I only get a file path, or can I see the image you made?

**You see it, in colour, in the terminal, without doing anything at all.**

Over `--host`, codeaf fetches the generated picture from the other machine into this
machine's cache and paints that local copy in the terminal when the tool finishes. The
line under it remains the far path, because that is where the conversation wrote it. The
path is clickable: opening it hands the read-only local copy to your desktop. Home's `made for you` band
also lists the far machine's generated pictures, audio, music and video under the
conversation that made them, and those paths open through the same file door.

## Where did my picture go over ssh

Over `--host`, the picture is written on the other machine and then its bytes are fetched
back for the terminal preview. The row paints the fetched copy and names the far path
under it. cmd+click that path on a Mac, ctrl+click it on Linux, or type `/files <path>`;
codeaf opens the read-only cached copy with the viewer on the machine you are sitting at.
If the picture is over the connection's 16MB fetch limit, the far machine refuses the
transfer by name and the path remains the honest answer. The refusal ends with the machine
that still has it, exactly: ` · the picture remains on <machine>`.

The line above is what codeaf itself reads — a path is all that goes into the
conversation. The screen adds a compact **preview** / **open original** control after
the call finishes. Images start collapsed in both chat and task pages; no mosaic is
automatically drawn. Attached pictures use the same controls, preserving their
numbered `[#1 shot.png]` markers.

Click **preview**, or use **alt+i** for the last visible image, for a terminal preview
at up to **20 rows**. Attached messages expand one picture at a time. Click **collapse**
to close it. An image tool's ordinary row also opens with `enter`, and a `view_image`
expansion retains what the looking model said.

Click the expanded image itself or **[open original]**, or use **alt+o**, to open the
full-resolution file in your
system's viewer. In `--host` sessions, engine-owned files are fetched and mirrored
locally first. Local attachments open directly from this machine. A plain SSH login
cannot launch a viewer on your laptop automatically; use the local `--host` client or
retrieve the file yourself.

The optional preview uses half-block characters, two pixels per terminal cell. It is
explicitly **low resolution**, regardless of terminal brand: use the original to read
screenshot text or inspect fine detail. PNG, JPEG, GIF and WebP previews require 256
colours or better and graphical Unicode support. Missing or unsupported previews
retain the original-file action. Original opening is available on colourless and
screen-reader displays too.

The "what is on the screen" page has the preview limits and fallback details.

## Can you edit, restyle or combine images I already have?

Yes — that is `reference_paths`, and it is the same tool.

Give one path and the prompt becomes an instruction about that picture: change
the background, ink the sketch, put it in another style. Give several and they
are combined. The references are files in your workspace — **png, jpeg, webp or
gif, up to 10MB each** — and anything else is refused by name, e.g.
`could not read art/missing.png`, before a penny is spent.

The useful part: **the path `generate_image` just returned is itself a valid
reference**, so codeaf can pass its own last render back in and iterate — a
diagram redrawn until it is right, a character kept the same across pictures.

## Can you use a different model for one picture, sound or video?

Yes. All four making tools — `generate_image`, `speak`, `generate_music`,
`generate_video` — take an optional `model` argument: which model to use **for
that one call**, when the default is wrong for it. A photoreal render on one
model, a diagram on another, a different voice vendor for one line — without
touching any setting.

The word is matched against the catalog **within that kind of media**: a full
slug works, and so does a fragment like a vendor or family name — `seedream`,
`gemini`, `grok`. The word `best` picks the strongest advertised model of that
kind. A word that matches nothing is refused before any money is spent — `no
image model matches "xyz"` — and a word that names a model of the wrong kind is
refused by naming what it actually makes, e.g. `fish-audio/s1 makes speech, not
image`.

**Leaving `model` out uses the session's default**, resolved from your settings
as ever, and the next call without the argument rides the default again — a
one-call choice never changes any setting. The result line always names the
model that actually generated the file, so you can tell which one made what.

This is the same freedom you have yourself in `/settings` → Providers, handed
to codeaf per call: ask it to "draw this one with gemini" or "try the best
image model" and it can, just in time.

## Which image model was used, and how do I see the prompt you sent?

**The step row names it, and opening the step shows the input.**

While a picture is being drawn the row is the tool and its clock. When it
finishes the row reads:

```
generate_image circle.png · seedream-5    1.2 MB · 2.4s
```

The file is what you are reading for, so it leads; the image model behind the
middle dot is dim, because it qualifies the file rather than being the point of
it. It is the **short** spelling — the vendor prefix comes off, so
`bytedance/seedream-5` reads `seedream-5`. If the model is not known — the call
is still running, or the conversation was recorded by an older build — the row
says **nothing at all** there rather than a placeholder.

Click the row, or select it with ↑/↓ and press **enter**, to open the step. It
shows what went in, as prose rather than as JSON:

```
"a small red circle, flat vector, centred on white"
1024x1024
from art/sketch.png
drawn with seedream-5
```

The prompt first, in quotes, exactly as it was sent — a very long one folds at
twelve lines and `… N more lines` lifts the rest. Then one line for each other
input you gave: the size or the aspect ratio, and the pictures it worked from.
An input you left out has no line, because leaving `size` out means the image
model's own default and codeaf will not guess at what that is. The picture
itself, and the path under it, follow below.

If the call asked for a model in its own words, the line keeps both halves —
`asked for best · drawn with seedream-5` — so you can see what was requested and
what actually ran. A running call that asked for one says `asked for seedream`
until it finishes.

A call that **failed** has no file and no model beside it on the row — there was
no picture to attribute. The model it tried is named inside the failure the
expansion shows, e.g. `Image generation failed (bytedance-seed/seedream-5-0-pro):
…`.

To change which model draws, just say so: "draw this one with gemini", "use the
best image model". That is the `model` argument on the tool, described in the
section above, and it changes nothing permanently. For a new default, use
`/settings` → Providers.

## Why does a picture or video look generic, blurry, or like AI slop?

Four causes, all fixable — none of them is "the model is bad at this".

**The prompt left too much undecided.** Every dimension a prompt does not
decide — the medium, the light, the palette, the mood, the era — the image or
video model fills with its statistical average, and that average is exactly what
generic AI output looks like: over-smooth, over-lit, style-less. The fix is
specificity: codeaf writes the decisions into the prompt rather than asking for
"a nice picture of X" and hoping. Ask it to redo a generic render "as a
photograph, natural light" or "as a flat diagram, two colours" and the words go
straight to the model.

**Every dimension was decided — to the genre's own cliché.** A fully detailed
prompt can still land on the average when each detail is what everyone in that
genre writes: the glowing shape on a dark field, the neon palette, the adjective
pile ("ultra-detailed", "cinematic"). Eight models given that prompt return
eight competent copies of the same picture, because the prompt asked for the
mean of the genre. And the mean cannot be escaped from inside the genre —
recolor a glowing dark-mode network and it is still a glowing dark-mode
network. The exit is a **real medium, named**: a print process, a photographic
setup, a drafting or filmmaking tradition. A real medium carries its own
physics and its own, different average — a risograph poster or an editorial
photograph simply is not drawn from the pool "digital AI art" comes from. This
applies however the render is made: the same law covers a prompt sent through
`generate_image` and one a script of codeaf's own sends to an API.

## Why is everything you make glowing on a dark background?

Because that is the statistical center of the genre the prompt stayed inside —
"digital tech illustration" resolves to luminous lines on a dark field almost
regardless of the other words — and because saying **"no glow" does not work**:
image and video models barely read negation, so the word "glow" in "no glow"
pulls toward glow. Two fixes, and they work together:

- **Leave the genre, do not redecorate it.** Name a real medium with real
  physics — "flat vector print, two spot colors on warm paper", "daylight
  editorial photograph", "pencil technical drawing on vellum". Each of those has
  its own average, and none of them glows.
- **Specify positively until the default has no room.** Instead of forbidding,
  describe what IS there: the surface (matte paper, cloth, brushed metal), the
  light (overcast daylight, one window, flat studio), the palette by name.
  Matte ink on cream paper *cannot* glow; a prompt that establishes it never
  needs the word "no".

When a render comes back, codeaf judges it against the genre as well as the
brief — "could this be mistaken for every other image of its kind?" — and
iterates when the answer is yes.

**Nothing asked for sharpness.** `generate_image` takes `size` (for example
`1024x1024`) and `generate_video` takes `resolution` (for example `1080p`), both
passed to the model untouched; left out, the model's own default decides, and a
default can be modest. Ask for "1080p" or "a larger size" and it is passed
through — a sharper render costs more and, for video, takes longer.

**The first render was accepted as the last.** A first render is a draft. codeaf
can look at what it made (`view_image`, or `read` on the file), judge it against
the brief, and iterate — the path a render returned is a valid
`reference_paths` entry, so "fix the hands, keep everything else" is one more
call, not a fresh roll of the dice. For video, `seed` holds a shot steady while
one thing about it is changed.

A different model is also a real lever: the `model` argument tries another one
for a single call, and `best` picks the strongest advertised — see "Can you use
a different model for one picture, sound or video?".

## Can you read this out loud, or make a voiceover?

Yes, with `speak`, when a speech model is available.

Arguments: `text` (required), `voice`, `path`, `model`. It writes an **mp3** and answers
with the path, the file size and the model, e.g.

```
.codeaf/audio/20260817-142433-good-morning-harbour-road.mp3 — 84.2KB of mp3 audio, spoken by <model>
```

**Leave `voice` out and the provider's default voice speaks.** Name one only if
you asked for a particular voice, because a voice the model does not have is a
failed generation rather than a near miss.

With no speech model set in `/settings` → Providers, the default is
`fish-audio/s2.1-pro`, falling back to `fish-audio/s1`, then `hexgrad/kokoro-82m`
and then `openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts` on a catalog that does not advertise it. A
model you set yourself wins over all of them.

There is no duration in the result: nothing here opens the mp3 to measure it, and
a guessed length would be worse than none. Play the file to hear it — codeaf
cannot listen to audio.

## Can you write me music, compose a song, or make a backing track?

Yes, with `generate_music`, when a music model is available. It is a **different
model and a different tool from `speak`** — one composes, the other reads text
aloud — so a machine can easily have one and not the other.

Arguments: `prompt` (required), `path` and `model`. The prompt describes the **music** —
genre, instruments, tempo, key or mood, how it should develop — and is not lyrics
to sing and not text to be read out.

**The call returns immediately with a background job**, exactly as
`generate_video` does, because a compose takes most of a minute:

```
job 4 started; composing on <model> — the finished piece arrives as a note naming the file. Log at /path/to/.codeaf/jobs/4.log
```

codeaf keeps working — on other clips, on a stitch, on the conversation —
while the piece is written, and when it lands codeaf is told in a note at the
next step:
`job 4 finished: .codeaf/music/20260818-160204-a-calm-solo-piano-loop.mp3 — 1.6MB of mp3 audio, composed by <model>`.
A compose that fails says so the same way: `job 4 failed: music generation
failed (<model>): …`. It shows in `jobs list` as `job 4 · music · running · 12.3s
· a calm solo piano loop`, and `jobs kill 4` stops it — `music (job 4) stopped;
no music was saved`. Like every job, it dies when the conversation ends.

**There is no length argument**, because the endpoint has none: the model writes
a piece of its own choosing — half a minute to a minute in practice — and you
cannot ask for eight seconds, or for three minutes. Nor is there a format
argument; you get what the model sends. **The length stops mattering the moment
the piece goes under a video**: `edit_video` with `action: score` loops a piece
that is shorter than the cut and trims one that is longer, so fitting it needs
no measuring and no arithmetic — see "Can you put music under a video, or add a
soundtrack?". The compose tool itself still neither measures nor trims, because
the length is the model's choice, not the brief's.

**Every call costs the same whatever comes back**, around **$0.08**, because the
price is per call and not per second. That makes a short clip and a long one the
same money, so it is worth writing a full description and iterating on the
description rather than calling it repeatedly hoping for something shorter.

Music and speech land in **different folders** — `music/` and `audio/` — so a
session's takes of a theme are not mixed in with its voiceovers.

## Can a task or a harness make media, or only this conversation?

All of them can, under the same rule.

- **A task** (`propose_task`) carries the same media verbs this conversation
  does. A task briefed to draw a diagram has the hand that draws it.
- **An adaptive run**'s nodes carry them too.
- **A saved harness** may whitelist `generate_image`, `speak`, `generate_music`,
  `generate_video` and `view_image`, and a step may call them. The list the
  designer is offered is the same list the run resolves against, so a design can
  never name a verb the run could not execute. See the "saved shapes of work"
  page.

The rule is the same everywhere: **no model for that kind of media, no verb** —
absent rather than present and refusing.

One thing worth knowing about tasks: when a task is stopped for running too long,
it gets a final "land now" turn to save what it has. That turn keeps the saving
tools — `write`, `edit` and every media verb it had — so a task whose deliverable
is a picture can still produce it. It used to keep only `write` and `edit`, and a
task that had spent its whole life painting would answer that it had no image
tooling available.

## Can you make a video?

Yes, with `generate_video`, when a video model is available — and this one
behaves differently from most tools, because a render takes **minutes**.
(`generate_music` behaves the same way, for the same reason.)

**The call returns immediately with a background job**, like `bash` with
`background: true`:

```
job 3 started; filming on <model> — the finished video arrives as a note naming the file. Log at /path/to/.codeaf/jobs/3.log
```

It keeps working while you and codeaf carry on talking. When it lands, codeaf is
told in a note at the next step:
`job 3 finished: .codeaf/video/20260817-143001-a-ferry-at-dawn.mp4 — 4.2MB of mp4 video, 8.0s with sound, filmed on <model>`.
The length and the sound answer are measured from the file itself — a clip that
landed silent says `without sound` — and when the file cannot be measured the
note simply omits both rather than guessing. A render that fails says so the
same way: `job 3 failed: video generation timed out (<model>); no video was
saved`. Nothing waits for it and nothing polls it.

With no video model set in `/settings` → Providers, the default is
`bytedance/seedance-2.5`, falling back to `bytedance/seedance-2.0-mini` on a
catalog that does not advertise it. A model you set yourself wins over both.

Arguments: `prompt` (required), `duration` in seconds, `aspect_ratio`,
`resolution`, `seed`, `model`, `frame_paths`, `reference_paths`, `path`.

- `frame_paths` pins the motion: the first picture is the opening frame, a second
  is the closing one. **More than two is refused** — the wire has no third slot.
- `reference_paths` sets the look — style, palette, a face — and not the motion.
- An image `generate_image` just made is a valid frame or reference.
- `resolution` is how sharp the render is, spelled the video model's way (for
  example `720p` or `1080p`) and passed through untouched. Leave it out for the
  model's own default; a higher resolution is a slower, costlier render.
- `seed` is a fixed number that makes the render's randomness repeatable, when
  the model takes one. The same seed with the same prompt and pictures
  re-renders close to the same shot — hold it steady to change one thing about
  a shot that was mostly right, leave it out for a fresh roll.

The render **is** a job: it shows in `jobs list` as
`job 3 · video · running · 42.1s · a ferry at dawn`, and `jobs kill 3` stops it —
`video (job 3) stopped; no video was saved`. Like every job, it dies when the
conversation ends. The provider gives up after **10 minutes** and no file is
saved.

## Can you make a longer video — several clips, a whole story, 2 minutes of film?

Not in one render, and yes by joining several — a single render is a short
clip, because the video providers top out around ten seconds; nothing in
codeaf extends one render. A longer video is several `generate_video` calls
joined with **`edit_video`**, whose `join` action lays clips end to end and
carries every one of their audio streams. Whether the result hangs together is
decided by three facts about the render tool:

- **Every render is independent.** The video model sees one prompt and the
  pictures passed to that one call — never the conversation, never an earlier
  clip. A prompt that says "the hero" without describing him reaches a model
  that has never met the hero, so everything that must match across clips is
  described in every prompt.
- **Pictures are the only thread between clips.** The same `reference_paths`
  handed to every call keep a face and a costume steady. For clips that should
  **connect** — one shot flowing into the next — the last frame of a finished
  clip is passed as the next call's opening `frame_paths` entry, and that frame
  is saved with `edit_video`'s `frame` action, which takes the closing frame by
  default (in a saved harness step, whose `generate_video` has no `frame_paths`,
  the same slot is the first `reference_paths` entry). That chain makes connected
  clips a sequence: they cannot all render in parallel.
- **Each clip lands with its own sound**, and its note says so. `edit_video`'s
  join carries all of it: a clip with sound keeps its own, a silent clip is given
  silence of its own length, so the cut cannot go quiet part-way through. A
  continuous score is separate — `generate_music`, a background job whose file
  exists only once its note has landed, laid under the finished cut with
  `edit_video`'s `score` action.

Even chained, clips are distinct shots with some drift between them — a
stitched video is a cut, not one continuous take. Fewer scenes in one setting
read as more coherent than many scattered ones.

## Why is a stitched video incoherent, or silent after the first clip?

Both come from the facts above, and both are fixable.

**The story or the characters are not coherent:** the clips were rendered
independently with nothing shared — each `generate_video` call reaches the
video model alone, with no memory of the other clips. The fixes are the
threads that do cross: the same reference images on every call, every prompt
describing everything that must match, and — for shots that should flow into
each other — the previous clip's final frame passed as the next clip's opening
frame, which means rendering those clips one after another rather than all at
once.

**No sound, or no audio after the first clip:** the clips almost certainly
landed with sound — each clip's landing note says `with sound` or `without
sound`, measured from the file — and the join dropped it. **A cut joined with
`edit_video` cannot do that**: its join gives every clip an audio stream, real
or generated, so there is no way for the sound to stop part-way through. A cut
that *is* silent after the first clip was joined by hand in the shell instead,
where an ffmpeg filter that only touches the video streams carries just the
first input's audio and discards the rest without a word. The fix is to join it
again with `edit_video`, not to repair the command. Music is separate either
way: a score under the whole cut is `generate_music` — started early, because it
is a background job whose file arrives as a note — then laid under the joined cut
with `edit_video`'s `score` action, which loops or trims it to fit by itself.

## Can you join clips together, stitch or concatenate videos into one video?

Yes, with `edit_video` and `action: join`. It is **local, free and instant** —
nothing about it is a render, and it costs no money at all.

Give it `clips`: the video files to lay end to end, **in the order they should
play**, at least two of them. Optionally `path` for where to save the result;
leave it out and the cut lands where this session keeps its video, under a
timestamped name.

Two things it decides for you, and they are the two a hand-written ffmpeg
command gets wrong:

- **Every clip's audio is carried.** A clip with sound keeps its own; a clip
  with none is given silence of its own measured length. So the joined cut has
  one continuous audio stream and **cannot** go quiet part-way through.
- **Every clip is fitted to the first clip's frame** — scaled to fit inside it
  and letterboxed with black, never stretched — and resampled to the first
  clip's frame rate, because concatenating mixed rates produces a cut whose
  timing drifts.

The answer is measured off the file that now exists, not claimed:

```
.codeaf/video/20260901-181201-joined-cut-of-4-clips.mp4 — 34.0s with sound, 1280×720 at 24fps, 12.4MB of mp4 video, joined from 4 clips
```

Limits, in its own words. At most **64 clips** in one call — `a join takes at
most 64 clips at a time` — and a join of one is refused rather than quietly
copied: `a join needs at least 2 clips; one clip is already the video`. A file
with no picture in it is named: `score.mp3 has no video in it, so there is
nothing to join`. One call is given up on after five minutes — `ffmpeg gave up
after 5m0s` — and leaves nothing half-written behind.

## How long is this video, and does it have sound?

`edit_video` with `action: measure` answers, for a video file already on disk,
for nothing, in about a tenth of a second. Give it `video`; it writes nothing.

```
shots/ferry.mp4 — 8.0s with sound, 1280×720 at 24fps, 4.2MB of mp4 video
```

Length, sound, frame size, frame rate and file size, each **measured from the
file** and each simply absent when the file does not state it — a fact nobody
measured is never guessed at.

**This is not the same question as `read`.** `read` on a video hands the file to
a video-reading model and answers what *happens* in it: who is in the shot, what
the text on screen says, whether the cut works. That costs money and takes a
moment. `measure` answers the arithmetic a cut is planned from — how long the
clips are, whether the join has any sound to carry — and costs nothing. Ask
`measure` when the question has a number for an answer.

A clip codeaf rendered itself already states both facts in its landing note, so
measuring one again is only worth it after something has been done to it.

## Can you save a frame, a still or a thumbnail out of a video?

Yes, with `edit_video` and `action: frame`. Give it `video`, optionally `at` and
`path`.

`at` takes **`closing`** (the default), **`opening`**, or a number of seconds.
The everyday words work too — `last`, `final`, `end`, `first`, `start`.

**The default is the closing frame because that is the one that connects two
renders.** Every `generate_video` call is independent and remembers nothing, so
the only way to make one shot flow out of another is to hand the finished clip's
final frame to the next call as its opening `frame_paths` entry. Save the frame,
pass it, and the shots join instead of cutting.

It is saved as a **png** — lossless, because the picture is often handed straight
back to a render — and lands where this session keeps its pictures. `jpg`, `jpeg`
and `webp` also work if you name one in `path`; anything else is refused: `a
frame is saved as a picture — .mp4 is not one of jpeg, jpg, png, webp`.

**A moment past the end of the clip is refused, not saved empty.** An ffmpeg
seeked past the last frame decodes nothing, writes nothing and reports success,
so the refusal is codeaf's own and it carries the clip's measured length: `Could
not save the frame: ferry.mp4 runs 4.2s and has no frame at 9s — ask for a
moment inside it, or for the closing frame`. `closing` is a seek from the end and can
never be past one.

The answer names the whole absolute path, the picture's measured shape, and which
frame of which clip it is:

```
/home/you/work/.codeaf/images/20260901-181330-the-closing-frame.png — 1280×720 png, 812.4KB, the closing frame of ferry.mp4
```

## Can you put music under a video, or add a soundtrack?

Yes, with `edit_video` and `action: score`. Give it `video` and `audio` — an mp3
from `generate_music` or `speak`, or any file with sound in it.

**The music's own length does not matter.** A piece shorter than the video is
looped until it fills it; a longer one is trimmed. That is the whole reason
`generate_music`'s missing length argument stops being a problem: the piece it
wrote is fitted to the cut, not the other way round. The answer says which
happened — `score.mp3 looped to fit` or `score.mp3 trimmed to fit`.

**It goes UNDER what is already there.** A video with its own sound keeps it and
the music is mixed beneath at level `0.3`; a silent video gets the music at full
level. `level` sets that yourself (1 is as recorded), and `replace: true` drops
the video's own sound instead of mixing under it. `level: 0` is refused, and the
refusal points at the argument that meant it: `level is how loud the music is
and must be above zero; use replace to drop the video's own sound`.

`fade` is seconds to fade the music out at the end, and it is worth naming when
the piece was looped: a loop that stops dead mid-phrase sounds like a mistake
somebody made. Left out, the score ends where the picture does.

The picture is **copied, not re-encoded**, so scoring a finished cut takes
seconds and loses no quality.

## Can you edit video without a video model — and what if this machine has no ffmpeg?

Two separate answers, and the first is the useful one.

**`edit_video` needs no model, no key and no money.** It is the one media verb
that is not gated on your settings: it is there on a machine that cannot
generate a single frame, because measuring, framing, joining and scoring footage
you already have is real video work that needs nothing bought. Drop a screen
recording or a camera clip in the folder and all four actions apply to it.

**What it does need is ffmpeg and ffprobe on the machine.** They are not
downloaded on demand. Without them the verb is **absent** rather than present and
refusing — codeaf simply does not have it, the same way it does not have
`generate_video` without a video model — so asking gets an honest "I do not have
that here" rather than a failed attempt. Install ffmpeg (it carries ffprobe with
it) and the verb appears on the next conversation.

The four actions are `measure`, `frame`, `join` and `score`; anything else is
refused by name: `Unknown action: transcode. Use measure, frame, join, score.`
There is deliberately no trim, no crop, no speed change and no transition —
those are `bash` and ffmpeg directly, and they always were. What lives here are
the four operations a *generated* film is assembled from, where getting them
wrong is silent.

**`edit_video` works in tasks, in adaptive runs and inside saved harnesses**
under the same one condition, exactly as the making verbs do.

## Where do I find the file for the image you generated — where pictures, audio, music and video end up?

In one of three places, decided by whose folder the workspace is:

- If the session **owns** its workspace (codeaf made it), files land straight in
  it, like anything else the work produced.
- If the workspace is **your repository**, they land in the session's own
  `artifacts/` folder instead, so nothing of codeaf's is dropped in your project.
- With no session folder at all, they land under
  `<workspace>/.codeaf/images`, `/audio`, `/music` or `/video`.

Either way every generated file gets a row in the deliverables index, so
`/files` finds it again later by name and date, from any directory. Give the
tool an explicit `path` and that decision is yours instead.

**A saved program lands its files in the same three places**, and they get the
same row: a film a harness assembles is a deliverable of the conversation that
ran it, not something hidden away in a folder of its own.

**A refused action leaves nothing behind.** When `edit_video` will not do
something — a join of one clip, a clip nothing can be read out of, a fade longer
than the picture — no empty file is left where the result would have gone. A
`path` you named yourself is never touched by that, whatever is already in it.

## What does a picture, a voiceover, a piece of music or a video cost?

Real money, and more than a message does.

Generation is billed by the provider per image, per stretch of audio, per piece
of music, per render — a video is the expensive one, often more than a whole
conversation of talking. **Music is billed per call**, around $0.08, whatever
length comes back. That spend lands on **the session's total**, not on the turn
that asked for it: no single turn is charged for a render that arrived ten
minutes after it ended. `/cost` shows the total, and a picture you asked for is
inside it.

The permission rules apply as they do to any other tool, so under the default
approval mode you are asked before a generation runs. See the permissions page
for how to change that.
