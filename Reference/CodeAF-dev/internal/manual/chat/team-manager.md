# The team manager

## What a manager is

A team can have one **manager**: a conversation that runs the team for you. You talk to the
manager, and it hands work to the team's members, keeps track of what each is doing, and tells
you where things stand. It is an ordinary conversation with every ordinary tool, under the
same permission rules as any other; what makes it the manager is the team verbs below, an
instruction from codeaf on its first request that it is this team's manager (with its members'
handles and the rules under **Who outranks whom**), and a short account of its team that it
carries on every turn: each member's handle and state, the question a member is waiting on, the
files each has touched, and the last few lines of the team's traffic. It never carries members'
whole conversations. A member of a team with a manager is told the same way which team it is
in, its handle, and that it reports with `team_post`.

Every member has a **handle**: one lowercase word that says what the conversation is about,
like `@security` for `santosh dev2 branch code complexity & security review`, `@milestones`
for `CodeAF repo issue tags & milestones` or `@gravity` for `quantum gravity research updates`.
The moment a member has a title it gets a quick guess from the title's words, so it can be
addressed at once; then, when the conversation's title is made, the same cheap model that
names conversations chooses the word, once, for a few tokens. A timeout or a dropped
connection is asked once more, a moment later; a refusal is not, and the guess stands. If another member of the team
already has that word, the member takes the model's second choice, or the word with one word
of its title in front, like `@api-security`. A handle a person or the manager gave, like the
one `team_start` names a new member by, is never replaced, and a handle the model chose is not
chosen again, so a line in the traffic keeps meaning the member it meant. Messages in a team
are addressed by handle.

Handles made before this were guesses, and each is chosen again the same way on its
conversation's next turn. Every change is written to the team's traffic as
`codeaf  @review is now @security`, which the manager and every member are told at their next
step, and the manager's account of its team shows the new handle. Over `--host` the choosing
happens on the far machine, where the conversation and the model are.

In the manager's replies, in the team's quoted cards and in a team tool's call, every member's
handle is a link: point at it for its title in the hint line, press it to open that member,
which resumes it first when this window does not have it open. A team's name in those same
places, written as a team (`team harbor`, `the harbor team` or `"harbor"`), is a link too. A
press opens the **teams page** with that team selected. The hint says `Open harbor on the
teams page · click`. Over `--host`, against an engine with no teams doors, the press opens the
conversations view on that team instead, and the hint says so.

## Making a manager

The **teams page** (`/teams`, `alt+2`) offers `+ Manager` on a team that has none, and
`All teams` offers one manager over every team. Choose a team to talk to its manager
beside the tree of teams.

Managers cost nothing until you make one. A team's manager is pinned at the left of
its tab strip and never scrolls away:

- **`+ Manager`**, a quiet button, while the team has none. A press starts a new conversation
  in the team's folder and makes it the manager. Its hint says so. Under 100 columns the
  button leaves the strip; the team switcher still offers it.
- **`◆ Make this harbor's manager`** in the team switcher (the `● harbor ▾` chip) makes the
  conversation in front the manager. A tile's Teams list on the conversations view makes
  that tile the manager. With an existing manager, the row names which one it replaces:
  `◆ Make this harbor's manager (replaces Shipping the parser)`. On the manager itself the row
  reads **`◇ Make an ordinary member`**, which turns it back into an ordinary conversation with
  all its history. When the chip reads `teams ▾` with All shown, choose a team and reopen the
  chip: All has no manager or Remove row. After you make a manager, the menu stays open and
  that row changes to `◇ Make an ordinary member`.

The manager's place reads **`◆ Manager`**. Its conversations tile comes first, titled
`◆ Manager · <its title>`. The tab's hint names its team and title. `alt+m` goes to the
manager from any conversation in the team.

An untitled manager is addressable immediately: codeaf derives its fallback handle from
the team's name, for example `@second` for Second. The manager over `All teams` uses
`@lead`; a team name that cannot supply a valid handle also falls back to `@lead`.
If the handle is already taken in that team, a number is added. Another manager can use
`team_send` before its first turn. Once its title is made, the ordinary title-based
handle choice may replace that fallback.

## The manager's screen

While the manager is in front, the message box says `to ◆ manager`, and keeps saying it on the
rule above the box once you start typing: everything you type goes to the manager and nowhere
else. With a member in front the box says `to @web` the same way.

On the right is the conversation's column, the same one every chat has. Its header is two
words, `Tasks 14 · Traffic 8` with `alt+l` at its right: the word in front is in bold ink and
the other is dim, each is a button (point at it for what it shows, press it to bring it to
the front), and while the tasks are in front the Traffic word keeps counting what arrived,
`Traffic 3 new`. With the manager in front the column opens on the **Traffic**; with a member
in front it opens on the tasks. Each kind of chat remembers the word you last chose for the
rest of the session. With the column holding the keyboard (`alt+t`), `←` and `→` switch the
words. Nothing here moves the conversation: both words are drawn in the same columns.

Under the header is what needs you, from both words: a member's question to you (`? @model → ◆
keep the old schema?`), a decision put to you, and your tasks that are waiting on
you, in the needs-you amber; a task that failed and that you have not opened yet is its `✕` in
ordinary ink. Three rows at most, then `+2 more`; a line closes the band, and when nothing
needs you there is no band at all. Pressing a question opens the member at the question; a
decision opens the teams page. What is in the band is not drawn again under it.

In the manager's chat the Traffic is the team's **work**, one line each, the newest at the
top. Every row reads who it is from and who it is for, then the words:

```
Tasks 14 · Traffic 8                 alt+l
? @model → ◆  keep the old schema?  3m
✕ parser bench incomplete
──────────────────────────────────────────
◆ → @scrape +2  Please provide a st… ▸ 2m
◆ → @model      Refactor the rail…  ▾ 1h
  ↳ @model → ◆  ✓ done, 3 files…      4m
  ↳ @model → ◆  working…              now
General                     2 msgs   ▸ 1d
```

- A row is a thread (below): `◆ → @scrape +2` is the manager to the first member, and `+2`
  for the ones that do not fit, then what it said. The state its answers leave it in
  (`running`, `asking`, `done`, `failed`) and how many messages it holds sit at the right
  when they fit, and the hint line always says them. How long ago sits at the right of
  every row, dim: `now`, `2m`, `3h`, `1d`, and past a month `30d`, `12w`, `1y`. A task row
  switches to a date after thirty days. A Traffic row does not. The band's
  questions carry it too. In a narrow column the arrow and the names stay, then the age,
  and only the words are cut, at a word, with `…`.
- `▸` lays the thread's replies open under it, one `↳` line per member, each `from → to`
  the same way (`↳ @model → ◆  ✓ done, 3 files changed  4m`): `✓` on an answer from a member
  that finished its turn, `✗` for one that failed, `working…` for a member the message woke
  that has not answered. Each reply keeps its own age at the right. `▾` (or
  `enter` on the row, with the column holding the keyboard) folds them. `▸` and `▾` are the
  only part of a thread row that folds it. The rest of the row opens the message.
- Everything that answers nothing and is answered by nothing (notes, starts, stops, handle
  changes, anything written before threads) is the one **General** thread, laid open the
  same way. A start that made a sub-team reads `◆ manager started @api to run backend`; the
  name is the team's name now, so a rename replaces `backend` on the next frame.
- A thin `new` line stands under what arrived since you last looked, and stays put while you
  read.

Every `@handle` is a link: point at it for the member's title in the hint line, press it to open
that member (resumed first when this window does not have it open) **scrolled to the
message**: a handle on a thread's row opens the member at the directive as it was told it, and a
handle on a reply opens it at its own post. A press anywhere else on the row opens the
conversation that message belongs to, at that message, and lifts it the same way. A message the
sender wrote opens the sender's chat: `◆ → all` opens the manager at that directive, and
`you → ◆` in a member's chat scrolls that chat to the reply. A message to you opens the
manager's chat. If that conversation is already in front, the row scrolls it in place and does
not open another. The hint says `Open ◆'s message · 2m ago · click` (or `Open your message`
when the row is yours, and `now` with no "ago" when it just arrived). The message is brought
into view and lifted for a moment; nothing here takes the keyboard, and nothing opens a new
window. If a hosted conversation's history is still arriving, the jump waits up to ten seconds
for its message. A message from before the conversation's history opens it at the bottom, and the hint
line says `that message is older than this chat's history`.

In a member's chat the Traffic is the messages to or from that member (and to the whole team),
one line each, newest first, and that member is `you`: `◆ → you  parser numbers?  2m` from the
manager, `you → ◆  ✓ p50 41ms, p99 180ms  now` back, `you → @gravity  rebase done  3h` to another
member. Press the member's own line to scroll this chat to it. Press a line the manager wrote
to open the manager at it. General, laid open, uses the same `from → to` and the same age on
each of its lines.

`alt+l` puts the column away and brings it back, and this window remembers the answer (`ctrl+g`
is the same key under its older name). Put away, the column is an edge down the right with a
count of what arrived in the Traffic since you last looked; press it or `alt+l` to bring it
back. On a window under 100 columns there is no column and no edge: `alt+l` lays the column
over the conversation, and `esc` or `alt+l` takes it off again.

Over `--host` teams and the manager work as they do locally. The teams and their Traffic are
kept on the machine the conversations run on, and the window reads and writes them there, so
the Traffic is the team's own and a manager set from the laptop is the one the far session
follows. Against a far machine running an older codeaf, `+ Manager` and the menus say managers
are not available over `--host`, and the column has no Traffic word.

## When a manager starts a member — team_start and approvals

When the manager starts a member with `team_start`, the conversation's approval posture
applies. The default `◇ YOLO` lets it start without a card; `◇ asks` raises a permission
card headed `◆ manager wants to start @lexer`, with the brief under it and the clause
`a new conversation; it spends until it stops`. With a card, `1 allow once` permits this
start, `2 always` permits this tool for the session, `3 deny` refuses, and `esc` leaves it
for later. An allowed start opens the new conversation in the
team's folder **behind** the one you are in, never in front of it: what you were typing stays
where it was. Its tab arrives at the end of the team's run, named `@lexer` until it has a title,
and its working mark is the only thing that moves. With the team's auto-wake on, the member
starts on its own: it is handed the brief on its first request, marked `◆ brief from manager`,
and its page shows the brief as a quoted card headed `◆ manager → @lexer`, never as your
message. With auto-wake off the conversation is still opened behind the one you are in, and
no turn is started; the traffic says `opened @lexer; this team's auto-wake is off, so no turn
was started. It reads the brief when it next runs.`, and the brief arrives on that next turn
the same way. When the manager stops a member,
its current turn ends the way your own Stop would, including when codeaf opened it in the
background without a window. Starting a new member still needs a window holding the manager.

## Who a Traffic row is from and who it is to

Every Traffic row reads `from → to`, then the words. The manager is `◆`. Several recipients
are the first handle and `+2` for the rest. In a member's chat that member is `you`, so a
question to it reads `◆ → you` and its answer reads `you → ◆`. A reply under a thread is the
same shape after `↳` (`↳ @model → ◆  working…  now`). The band's question is the same shape in
amber (`? @model → ◆  keep the old schema?  3m`). How long ago is on the row, at the right,
dim, at every width: `now`, `2m`, `3h`, `1d`, and past a month `30d`, `12w`, `1y`. A narrow
column keeps the arrow and the names,
then the age, and cuts only the words, at a word, with `…`. Press a handle to open that
member at the message. Press anywhere else on the row to open the chat that message belongs
to, at that message. The hint says `Open @model's message · 3m ago · click`.

## How old a Traffic row is, and what pressing it opens

Every Traffic row ends with how long ago it was, dim and at the right: `now` (under a minute),
`2m`, `3h`, `1d`. Past a month it stays a compact age: `30d`, then weeks from six weeks
(`6w`, and `12w` at about three months), then years (`1y`). A task row and a home session switch
to a date after thirty days (`26 Aug`). A Traffic row does not. It is on a thread
(`◆ → @scrape +2  Please provide… ▸  2m`), on a reply (`↳ @model → ◆  ✓ done  4m`), on General,
on the band's question, and on a member's own lines (`you → ◆  now`). A narrow column keeps
the arrow, the names and the age, and cuts only the words, at a word, with `…`.

Press anywhere on the row, not only on a handle, to open the conversation that message belongs
to, at that message. A message the sender wrote opens the sender's chat: `◆ → all` opens the
manager at the directive, and `you → ◆` in a member's chat scrolls that chat to the reply. A
message to you opens the manager's chat. If that chat is already in front, the row scrolls it
and does not open another window. The focus stays where it was. The hint says
`Open ◆'s message · 2m ago · click`, or `Open your message · now · click` for your own line.
`▸` and `▾` still only fold the thread. A handle still opens that member.

A deliberate message jump opens the activity and tool-call groups that contain the target before scrolling to it. Other history stays collapsed.

## What members say without being asked

A member of a team that has a manager tells the manager, through the traffic, three things it
would never write in a message:

- `finished` when a turn ends, `stopped` when somebody stopped it, and `failed: ` with the
  error's first line when a turn ends on one;
- when it starts waiting on you: the permission line for a permission prompt (`needs your ok
  to run bash`), or `asks: ` and the question for anything else;
- `no longer waiting` when the last of those questions comes down.

Each is one line of traffic per change, never one per step. They are the session's own words;
nothing you type is ever written to the traffic. `team_status` reads them too, so a member held
on a permission prompt shows as `asking` rather than `running`, for as long as some process
holds that conversation's transcript and the wait is under 30 minutes.

## Why a member stays asking after it crashed

It does not. `asking` means a live process is held on the prompt. If that process dies, the
transcript lock is free and the member reads as idle. The same happens when the wait is older
than 30 minutes, even if a process still holds the transcript: nothing is still asking.

## Who a member reports to

A conversation can be in more than one team, but it **reports to** exactly one manager, its
home: the nearest manager above it, picked for you and never changed by itself. Its home
manager directs it; every other manager whose team it is in is a **link**, which may read it
(`team_read`) and send it a note, and nothing more. A link's `team_send` of a directive, and
its `team_stop`, are refused with a sentence saying whose the member is; a directive to
`everyone` goes to the members who report to that manager and names the ones it left out.
In `team_status` a shared member reads `reports to dock`, and `busy for dock` while it runs.

## Who outranks whom

Your own words come first. What you say in a member's own conversation stands over anything
the manager tells it, then the manager's directives, then other members' messages. A member
reads a manager's message marked `◆ from manager` and a teammate's marked `from @web`, never
as if you had typed it.

The manager **cannot answer a member's permission prompt**. Those are yours; a member waiting
on one waits for you.

## The manager's verbs

| Verb | What it does | Asks you first |
|---|---|---|
| `team_status` | every member's handle, title and state (running, asking, idle, failed), the question waiting, the files touched, and recent traffic | no |
| `team_read` | the end of one member's conversation, bounded; the member is not told | no |
| `team_send` | a message to one member, to several (one message, every handle in `to`), or to everyone, as a note (information, which waits) or a directive (an instruction, which starts an idle member) | no |
| `team_stop` | ends one member's current turn, the way your own Stop does, whether a window has it open or codeaf opened it in the background: nothing is deleted, and its background tasks and jobs keep running | no |
| `team_start` | a new member conversation with a handle and a brief; it opens in the team's folder and is handed the brief, marked as the manager's, on its first request. With kind `team` it starts a sub-team instead (see **Sub-teams**) | under `◇ asks` |
| `team_decide` | answers a decision packet waiting on the manager, most often a member's question: an option, or its own words | no |
| `team_escalate` | sends a packet waiting on the manager up, to its own manager or to you, with the reason it is not the manager's to decide | no |
| `team_close_report` | brings you the team's closing report (done, left, where the files are) after you asked it to wrap up | no |
| `team_raise` | raises a conflict to the manager above every party (see **Conflicts between members and teams**); members have it too | no |

## Why team_start may ask before it starts

`team_start` follows the conversation's approval posture because a new conversation can
spend money; the default `◇ YOLO` allows it, while `◇ asks` raises the card. It is
refused while the team is at its daily cap. The others act only inside the team you made, and
every one of them is logged in the team's traffic. Questions, packets, caps and wrapping up are
on the page **Team questions, decisions and caps**.
Like any tool, each can be set to ask or allow in `/settings` under the tool approvals.

## What happens when a conversation stops being the manager

At its next step, a conversation removed as manager loses `team_status`, `team_read`,
`team_send`, `team_stop`, `team_start`, `team_decide`, `team_escalate` and
`team_close_report`. If it is still a member of a managed team, it keeps `team_post` and
`team_raise`; outside a team it loses those too. A remembered call to a removed manager
tool says `team_send is no longer one of your tools: this conversation no longer manages a
team.` A removed member tool says `team_post is no longer one of your tools: this
conversation is no longer a member of a team with a manager.` Made a manager again, it gets
the manager tools back at its next step.

## The member's verbs

A member of a team that has a manager has `team_post`: a message to the room (every member and
the manager), to one teammate by handle, or to the manager. Members use it to report progress,
share a finding, ask a teammate, or say they are blocked. It also has `team_raise`, for a
conflict it cannot settle with the other side itself.

## A manager is told when a member moves

Moving a conversation from one team to another, or moving a team under another, writes one
line to the Traffic of each team it touches. The team that lost the member says
`@web moved to harbor`. The team that gained the member says `@web joined from ops`. For a
team moved under another, that is the moved team's Traffic and its new parent's. A manager
reads those lines the next time it wakes, in the Traffic it already reads. Nothing about the
move wakes it by itself, and a move that was refused writes no line.

## Sub-teams

A manager can start a **sub-team**: `team_start` with kind `team`, a name for the new team, a
handle and a brief for its manager, and optionally members of its own team to move into it. You
are asked first under `◇ asks`, on the same permission card as a member start, which then
reads `a new team "backend" under yours, managed by it.` The default `◇ YOLO` starts it
without that card. When allowed:

- the new team is made under the manager's team, with its share of the pool: the parent's daily
  cap times `sub-team share` (`/settings`, **Teams**; 50% by default), written on the new team.
  A parent with no effective cap gives no derived child cap, and the new team follows the
  ordinary cap rules: its own profile-default pool unless an explicit ancestor cap applies;
- the members named move into it, and its manager is the new conversation, which opens behind
  the one you are in like any start, is a member of the parent team, and is handed the brief
  marked as the manager's together with the words `you were started to manage the team
  "backend"`. It makes itself that team's manager and reports to the manager that started it;
- the traffic of both teams says so: the start in the parent's, and in the new team's a line
  naming who made it and who runs it.

It is refused, with the reason, past the team depth (`team depth` in `/settings` under
**Teams**, three levels by default, a team's own override first), under a closed team, at the
team's daily cap, or when the name or the handle is taken.

## Sub-team orders and reports

**Orders go one level down, reports one level up.** A manager directs its own team's members,
and a sub-team's manager is one of them; it never directs a sub-team's members. A `team_send`
directive or a `team_stop` naming one is refused with a sentence that names the sub-team's
manager to send to instead. A message to `everyone` reaches the manager's own members only. A
manager may still read a conversation in a team under its own with `team_read`, naming it
`backend/@parser`. A sub-team's manager reports to the manager above: its `team_post` to the
manager and its own questions go there first.

**A sub-team with no manager of its own** answers to the nearest manager above it: its members'
questions go to that manager, and their `team_post` to the manager reaches it, marked with the
team it came from. Their posts to the room stay in their own team. That manager does not direct
them; give the sub-team a manager, or move them up, for that.

## The global manager

With several top-level teams there is no one manager over all of them until you make one on the
teams page's `All teams` row. That conversation is the **global manager**: the manager of a
team that holds every other team. Its members are the managers of the top-level teams, and
only them: codeaf adds each one to `All teams` for you, its account of its team lists only
those managers, and its directives reach them and never their members. The top-level managers
report to it, so their questions and conflicts between teams come to it before they come to
you. It can start a new top-level team with `team_start` of kind `team`. Without a global
manager, nothing here changes: each top-level manager reports to you.

## Conflicts between members and teams

When two or more conversations need incompatible things (the form posts JSON, the endpoint
takes form data) and cannot settle it between themselves, one of them raises it with
`team_raise`: the question, the other parties by handle (`@api`, or `back/@api` for a member
of another team), its own side, and the options, each with what happens if it is chosen. A
conflict is never detected for you; a party declares it.

It goes, as one decision packet, to the **lowest manager above every party** who is not one of
them, in one hop: two members of one team go to its manager, members of two sibling sub-teams to
the manager of the team both sit under, and two top-level teams to the global manager. With no
such manager it comes to you, in the inbox on the teams page. That manager is woken and handed
the packet whole; the other parties are told it was raised. It rules with `team_decide`, or
sends it up with `team_escalate`, never sideways. **The ruling reaches every party as a
directive**, marked as a ruling on that conflict, in each party's own team's traffic, and wakes
each of them, whoever ruled: a manager, or you. A party never decides its own case, even when
it manages the team the packet waits on.

## Threads: what answers what

Every line a member is handed carries its number, `◆ directive from manager #42: …`. A
member's `team_post` to the manager answers the last message the manager sent it, by itself;
to answer another it names it, `thread: #41`. The member's finishing, failing or asking, and
the wake that started it, answer the same message, which is how the Traffic and the chats draw
them under it. A message to several members is one message, so the question and its answers
are one thread however many were asked.

**In the manager's chat** a `team_send` reads as the head of its thread,
`team_send ◆ to @agent @checking @review · do`, with the message quoted under it and each
answer attached under that in muted ink as it arrives, one line each. Press an answer's words
to read it in full and again to fold it; point at them for the whole text in the hint line; a
handle opens its member at the message: on an answer, at the member's own post, and on the
card's header, at the message as the member was told it. A turn that sent one is not folded into a `worked` chip, so the
thread stays where you can see it. The step over it is captioned as the work it is,
`messaged @agent @checking @review`, never by the tool's name, and a run of sends reads
`sending 3 messages`.

The answers also reach the manager as its team's note. So nothing is shown twice, a note
whose answers are already under their question reads as one dim line,
`· @checking @review answered · in the thread above`; a line that answers nothing is drawn in
full as before.

**In a member's chat** the manager's message is the quoted card it always was, headed
`◆ manager → @web  do`, and the member's own answers to it hang under it the same way.

## When messages arrive

A message reaches a conversation at the start of its next step. When the conversation is
working, that is straight away. When it is idle, it depends on the kind of message:

- A **directive** starts an idle member's turn. The member is handed the directive, marked
  `◆ directive from manager`, never as if you had typed it.
- A **note** wakes nobody. An idle member reads it when it next runs, for whatever reason.
- A member's **reply to the manager** (`team_post` to the manager), and a member finishing
  without a reply, failing or starting to wait on you, start an idle manager's turn. A reply
  and the end of the same turn are one wake, even if the ending arrives after the manager
  already ran. Replies arriving within a few seconds are gathered into one turn.

A member no window has open is opened by codeaf in the background so it can run, and a window
that opens it later joins the running conversation. When that cannot be done, the traffic says
`could not wake @web:` and why, and the message waits for the member's next turn.

Every wake is a line in the traffic, `◆ woke @web` or `@web woke ◆`, so the Traffic shows why a
conversation is running. A wake spends through the same limits a turn you start does, and two
more bound it: one conversation is woken at most 20 times an hour, and a manager woken 10 times
by its team with nothing from you stops being woken and asks you instead, as a waiting line in
the traffic. It is woken again after you next say something to it.
The ten wakes count ten replies when each member turn replies and then finishes.

A team's auto-wake can be turned off. `team messages wake` in `/settings` under **Teams** is
the default every team inherits (on), and a team can override it for itself and the teams
under it: its entry in `teams.json` in the profile carries `"wake": false` (or `true`). With it
off, every message waits for each conversation's next turn, and a member the manager starts
with `team_start` is opened and handed its brief on that next turn, with no turn started for
it. The traffic says so.

A member busy in one long command reads a message when that command returns, which is what
`team_stop` is for. Nothing is delivered twice, and a conversation that joins a team is not
handed the team's earlier history. A conversation reopened later is handed what was said to it
while it was closed.

The traffic itself is kept in the profile of the machine the conversations run on, in
`teams/<id>/traffic.jsonl`, one line per message, only ever added to.

## Which approval rules do new members inherit?

A member started by the manager inherits the manager's approval posture before
it joins and receives work. The conversation saves its own setting for resume.
If the new conversation cannot apply the posture, the start is refused and the
manager sees the reason. An untitled manager receives an available handle from
the team store, so it can be addressed immediately.

## Quiet updates from the team

Team exchanges are work details: they stay in the compact activity view while
work runs and fold behind the work line afterwards. Open the work line and its
step to read the complete exchange, or open Traffic. The manager is instructed
to tell you meaningful new results, blockers, decisions, and requested updates,
without repeating an unchanged status. Its exact `[no change]` response is kept
in the model record but does not add another answer to your conversation.

## Opening a new member’s brief from Traffic

Press a new-member Traffic row’s words to reveal the accepted `team_start` call in
the manager’s conversation. Its receipt carries the message number. Press the
member’s handle to open the delivered brief in that member’s conversation.
Collapsed work opens at the selected message. Older unnumbered receipts are
matched only when the accepted handle and brief identify one successful start
in the current team; ambiguous or missing history is not guessed.
