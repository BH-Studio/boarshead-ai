# OpenRouter credits and free models: it worked and then stopped

## Out of credits — why codeaf picks only free models

For the default OpenRouter service, codeaf reads the account's credit balance and
the key's own spending cap, whichever is smaller. A known remaining balance of $0.50
or less is low. While it is low, a new conversation on a profile where you never
chose a model opens on `qwen/qwen3.8-27b:free`, and the two helper rows nobody set
use `nvidia/nemotron-3.5-lightning:free` for reflex and
`thinkingmachines/inkling-small:free` for small work. The crew's three seats — worker,
planner and checker — are picked per task, and a low balance reaches them as an
OpenRouter account out of credit: a seat nobody pinned is routed to a free pool, and the
task's crew line says `free routes in use (may log prompts) · credit unavailable on
openrouter` (*Route health* in *Models and cost*).

While the balance is low, the first-run setup screen's **chat model list shows free models
only** — the `:free` ids and the catalog rows priced at zero, with `free only` on its count
line and `Your OpenRouter account is low on credits · the list shows free models only` on
the last row of the screen — so a person who has never run codeaf is not handed three hundred paid names to
pick the wrong one from. The model already in use stays on that list.

Free ids are defaults only. A model you chose with `/model` or the setup screen,
`--model`, `CODEAF_MODEL`, a seat you pinned with `/crew pin` or a helper row you set stays
chosen, and the free defaults are never written into your settings. Nothing is spent
reading the balance: it is two account lookups and no model call.

OpenRouter limits free models to 20 requests per minute, and to 50 requests per
day until the account has ever bought $10 of credit (1,000 per day after that),
so a long task can use up the free allowance quickly. The balance, the free
defaults and the warning apply only to OpenRouter — never to Codex, a local model
or another connected service.

## It worked and then stopped

If codeaf worked and then stopped on a paid OpenRouter model, the account has
probably run out of credit: OpenRouter reserves the most a request could cost
before it runs, so a few small turns work and then a larger one is refused and
the chat stops. The refusal row keeps the vendor's whole sentence and its top-up
link, and codeaf reads the balance again, unless it read it in the last 30
seconds.

## A payment refusal — the affordable output cap and the top-up link

When OpenRouter's payment refusal says the account can only afford a number of
output tokens, codeaf sends the same request once more with `max_tokens` set to
that number, and the reply usually lands. If that is refused too, the turn ends
on the vendor's whole sentence, top-up link included, for example
`openrouter accepted the key but the account cannot pay — … can only afford 641. To increase, visit https://openrouter.ai/settings/credits and add more credits`.

Any payment refusal from OpenRouter — on your turn, or on a background call such
as the reflex, a title or a task — also starts a fresh balance read, unless one
finished in the last 30 seconds. If the account reads low, the free defaults and
the warning below take effect without a relaunch.

## Why is my model a free one — when the balance is read

codeaf reads the balance at launch when it has never read this key, when the key
changed, or when the last reading was low; right after a key is saved; after a
payment refusal; and, while low, when you switch the conversation or Home to a
paid model. It never polls it every turn, and reads caused by refusals or model
switches wait 30 seconds after the last one. A read that fails — no network, an
error from OpenRouter — changes nothing and never warns. A key with no spending
cap whose account balance OpenRouter will not report is simply unknown: no free
defaults, no warning.

On the ordinary engine launch, a turn ending `your key was not accepted for this model`
for the default service asks for a fresh read, whatever key source follows the sentence.
The read decides whether the key expired; a merely invalid key is a failed read and
changes nothing.

A conversation that has sent nothing and whose model nobody chose follows the
default both ways: onto the free model when the account reads low, and back to
the usual default when a later read finds more than $0.50. A conversation that has
sent a message keeps its model either way. After a top-up, the next new
conversation opens on the usual default, the helper rows return to their usual models,
and the crew is routed over paid routes again.

## My OpenRouter key has expired — the warning and what to do

OpenRouter keys can carry an expiry date, and an expired key is refused on every model,
the free ones included. codeaf learns it from the same balance read it makes for a low
account: when OpenRouter answers that read with `API key expired`, codeaf records the
key as expired instead of treating the read as failed, and
`Your OpenRouter key has expired — make a new one at openrouter.ai/settings/keys`
appears at the right of the keys row under a conversation's or Home's message box, in the
warning colour. Unlike the low-credits line it shows on **every** model the default
OpenRouter service serves — free or paid — and never on a model served by Codex, a local
model or another connected service. It wins over the low-credits line, and the free
defaults are **not** used, because they would fail on the same key. A turn refused with
`API key expired` mid-session starts a fresh read on both the ordinary engine launch
and `codeaf chat --no-host`, unless one finished in the last 30 seconds, so the warning
arrives without a relaunch. An expired
reading leaves an untouched conversation on its current model: it moves neither
from the free default to the paid default nor the other way, and adds no model note. On the first-run setup screen the same fact stands on the last row, and the list
is not cut to free models. When a connect step came before the screen it reads
`Your OpenRouter key has expired · esc to paste a new one from openrouter.ai/settings/keys`
and `esc` goes back there; when the key was already in the shell or the profile and only the
settings screen was asked, `esc` skips the setup instead and the line reads
`Your OpenRouter key has expired · /connect takes a new one from openrouter.ai/settings/keys`.
The fix is a new key at https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys, pasted on the connect step, in
`/settings`, or in `/connect`; the old key's warning goes the moment the new key is saved,
before it has even been read.

## Low on credits warning under the message box

`Your OpenRouter account is low on credits — some models may not be available`
appears at the right of the keys row under a conversation's or Home's message box
when the account is known low and that box names a paid OpenRouter model — any
model whose id does not end in `:free` and that the catalog does not list at a
price of zero, even one that still answers. It is drawn in the warning colour. It
goes away when you choose a free model, or when a read finds more than $0.50. It
never shows for a model served by Codex, a local model or another connected
service, and it never shows a dollar figure. On a window too narrow for the whole
sentence it is left out rather than cut.
