# Providers — the places models come from

Older builds called these **services** (or connections, or model services); this page and
the surfaces it describes now say **provider**. The word `codeaf services` in a shell is
something else again: long-running background processes, covered by their own page.

## Add a key — connect a provider, add an api key, use a different provider

An api key for another provider, or another model provider, is added here. Open `/connect` or
`/connections`. The `providers` group lists DeepSeek, Z.ai, Moonshot, MiniMax, Alibaba Qwen, Codex,
Ollama and **Custom OpenAI-compatible API**, followed by any provider already connected and, once
a custom provider is connected, a `+ add a provider` row. Codex says `browser`; it signs
in a ChatGPT plan instead of asking for an API key. Ollama needs no key. The other named vendors
ask for theirs.
Pick a row and answer its fields. A successful listed provider says
`deepseek-direct is connected · 6 models`; one without a list says only
`deepseek-direct is connected`. A provider with more than one billing door names the one it
bound: `z-ai-direct is connected · coding plan · 4 models` or
`z-ai-direct is connected · pay-as-you-go · 10 models`. The Providers tab in `/settings`
then shows the provider, door, safe spelling of its key, region and order.

The default provider remains first. With two or more providers, `/model` groups models by
provider in that order; with only the default provider, the picker remains ungrouped.

## Using codeaf with only a direct provider — no OpenRouter key at all

Yes. When the conversation is on a model from a connected provider, that provider can carry
the turn without an OpenRouter key. Pressing `enter` sends the message; the setup screen
does not open, and codeaf does not show
`openrouter is not connected · enter on your message connects in a browser, or export OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
Ollama counts as connected without a key because its local provider explicitly needs none.

The small background calls follow the same road — naming a session, titling a task, the
reflex and the judges — which normally use the models on the reflex and small-work rows. If one of those
models belongs to the default provider and that provider has no key, the call instead uses
the conversation's model on the connected provider. Tools, tasks and child agents launched
from that turn inherit the same rule, so none of them makes an OpenRouter request. If the
default provider does have a key, those calls keep using their configured models as usual.

## What model do I get after connecting a provider — why did my model change

A successful connection from `/connect`, or a reconnect from the Providers tab in
`/settings`, moves this conversation onto that provider in the same moment. A plan door's
first documented model wins. Otherwise codeaf uses the vendor's preferred model when the
provider listed it or published no list, then the first model the provider listed. With no
preferred or listed model there is no move and no extra sentence.

For example, the connection line
`z-ai-direct is connected · coding plan · 4 models` is followed by
`this conversation was on ~deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-latest · it is now on z-ai-direct/glm-5.3`.
The status line and `/model` show the new model at once. The previous model is named so
opening `/model` and choosing it once takes you back; `/model` is also how to go somewhere
else. If a turn is answering, the connection lands immediately but the model move waits
until that answer ends, so the model does not change under a sentence already streaming.

When the key is a variable, the receipt adds, for example,
`the engine process reads $DEEPSEEK_API_KEY from its own environment`. The daemon keeps
the environment it started with. If it started before that variable existed, run
`codeaf engine --stop --workspace <dir>` and launch codeaf again so the new engine reads
the variable.

`--no-host` has the same immediate result inside its one process. Under `--host` or
`--at`, connecting a provider is absent because the profile behind the conversation is
not the local profile the panel could write.

## Use my own DeepSeek key — connecting DeepSeek, GLM, Kimi, Qwen or MiniMax directly

Open `/connect` and choose the vendor in the `models` group. DeepSeek and MiniMax open
`your key` directly. Z.ai, Moonshot and Alibaba Qwen first open `your region` as a
choice with `International` under the cursor and `China` below it; a region is never
typed. Up and down, or `ctrl+p` and `ctrl+n`, move the cursor. A letter jumps to a
region whose name starts with it, enter takes the row under the cursor and opens
`your key`, and esc returns to the provider row with nothing saved. The same choice
opens when reconnecting one of these providers from its Providers row in `/settings`.
Z.ai is the direct provider for GLM and Moonshot is the direct provider for Kimi.
MiniMax, Ollama and **Custom OpenAI-compatible API** are single-door providers. MiniMax makes no plan
claim because its plan and metered traffic currently have no wire-level difference
codeaf can use to prove which balance answered.

A provider name cannot be confused with the author part of a model already on the default
provider. When `deepseek` is already an author there, codeaf connects the direct provider
under `deepseek-direct` in that same attempt. The region and key are not asked for twice,
and its models read `deepseek-direct/<model id>`.

## Why is my provider called z-ai-direct — I connected Z.ai, the name changed

A provider may not be written with a name the default provider already uses for a model
author. codeaf appends `-direct` and finishes the connection in the same attempt, so the
region and key are not asked for twice. The connect line tells you the name it used, for
example `z-ai-direct is connected · coding plan · 4 models`, and those models read
`z-ai-direct/<model id>`. DeepSeek follows the same rule: it becomes `deepseek-direct`,
and its models read `deepseek-direct/<model id>`.

## Connect a provider — what is asked for, and what codeaf checks before it saves anything

Open `/connect` and choose a row in `providers`. DeepSeek asks for `your key`. Z.ai,
Moonshot and Alibaba Qwen ask `your region` with one row per region: `International`
is first and starts under the cursor, then `China`. Up and down, or `ctrl+p` and
`ctrl+n`, move the cursor; a letter jumps to a region whose name starts with it;
enter takes the row under the cursor and then opens `your key`; esc backs out with
nothing saved. The region is a choice and cannot be typed. Ollama asks for nothing.
**Custom OpenAI-compatible API** asks for `your base url` and `name`, then asks for `your key`
only if the model-list address answers 401 or 403. A key may also be the name of an
environment variable, such as `$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`.

A key with the wrong shape is stopped before any call:
`that is not the shape of a deepseek key — they start with sk-`. A refusal carries the
provider's own answer, cut at 120 characters on a word boundary:
`deepseek refused that key — Authentication Fails, Your api key is invalid`. No answer is
different: `deepseek did not answer · nothing was saved`.

codeaf checks each billing door in order with a one-token completion and binds the first
one that answers. A no-plan or payment answer on one door moves the connection check to
the next; a bad-key answer stops immediately in the vendor's words. A missing answer also
moves to the next door. If no door answers, codeaf saves nothing. Key-prefix hints may
change which door is tried first, but never skip a door.

A spent plan window proves that plan door works: codeaf binds it, stops before the
pay-as-you-go door, and says `plan paused`. It does not make a paid probe or change the
saved billing door. When the vendor supplies a reset time, the connected line carries
the same sentence used during a turn, for example
`plan paused · resets at 18:30 UTC · /connect can switch to pay-as-you-go`.

The bound door is saved and every later request uses it. codeaf does not silently probe
or change billing doors while a turn runs. Only an explicit reconnect rechecks them:
re-enter the provider from its Providers row in `/settings`, or press `ctrl+r` there to
reuse the saved details. Disconnecting and reconnecting the provider through `/connect`
does the same check. Where a door has no fixed catalog, its model listing is believed
after the one-token check succeeds.

A payment refusal proves a key authenticated. For an unchanged one-door provider, the
provider is connected and stored as before. For a multi-door provider, codeaf tries the
remaining doors; if every one refuses for plan or payment reasons, it stores nothing and
says, for example,
`z-ai accepted the key but the account cannot pay — Insufficient balance or no resource package. Please recharge.`
A payment refusal on OpenRouter also asks for its balance again, subject to the
30-second quiet period after the last completed read. If OpenRouter
says it can afford a smaller positive output cap, codeaf retries that request
once with that cap. The final refusal keeps the vendor's whole sentence.
A plain `429` with no recognised payment or plan code still means the provider is busy and
is waited out. Every saved key lives in the profile `config.json`, owner-readable only.

## Z.ai coding-plan models — why only four GLM models are listed

Z.ai's coding endpoint publishes a wider model listing than its DevPack documentation
says the plan serves. codeaf therefore shows only the documented plan catalog:
`glm-5.3`, `glm-5.3-flash`, `glm-5.3[1m]`, and `glm-5.3-flash[1m]`. The
pay-as-you-go door keeps the model listing returned by that door.

## Plan paused — what happens when my plan runs out, reset times, and pay-as-you-go overflow

When a plan reaches a documented usage window, the turn is paced and the account is not
described as unable to pay. The live line says `plan paused`; when the vendor supplies a
reset time it also says, for example,
`resets at 18:30 UTC · /connect can switch to pay-as-you-go`. An account that cannot pay
remains terminal; a spent plan window is not the same thing.

Each connected plan provider has a Providers setting named `when the plan is paused`.
It defaults to `wait`, which never sends the turn to a metered door. Choose
`use pay-as-you-go` only when you want that provider to spend through its metered door.
During overflow the status line names it, for example
`writing · 4s · pay-as-you-go 61 t/s`. The setting is per provider.

## Is codeaf supported by Zhipu for the coding plan

Zhipu lists the tools its plan covers. codeaf is not currently listed; a request has been
drafted but has not been sent. codeaf identifies itself as codeaf and does not pretend to
be another supported client.

## What a provider without a model list can and cannot do

A common reason for “why can't it make pictures any more?” is that the conversation now
uses a provider without a model list. The answer depends on that provider's empty catalog,
not on the picture tool itself.

A provider whose model-list check proves absent says `deepseek is connected`
with no count. Its picker group contains one dim row:
`lists no models · type a model id`. Type a model id to use one; codeaf does not invent a catalog.

The vendored list fact is only the expectation from the documentation survey. A provider that was expected to have no list
but answers the check gets the listed behaviour immediately: its model count, picker group and provider-scoped cache all use
the ids it returned, with no reconnect.

An empty catalog also means codeaf cannot know which picture-making, speech or video
models that provider offers. Those tools are off the belt for that provider—absent rather
than present and broken. Text models can still be named and used. A direct provider has
one host, so there is nothing to choose between; that is not a fault.

## Remove a key — disconnect a provider, delete a key, stop using a provider

Open `/connect` and press `enter` on a connected row. The row first says
`enter again to disconnect`; press `enter` a second time to confirm. When no turn is using it, codeaf removes its saved key and says
`deepseek is disconnected · its models are gone from the picker`.

A provider answering the current turn cannot be cut:
`deepseek is answering right now · try again in a moment`. If this conversation used the removed provider, codeaf either says
the disconnected sentence first and then says
`this conversation was on deepseek-direct/deepseek-v4-pro · it is now on ~deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-latest`, or, when nothing can replace it,
`this conversation was on deepseek-direct/deepseek-v4-pro and nothing else here can take it · connect a provider or pick a model`.

## Model names carry the provider they came from

The default provider's model ids remain unchanged and unqualified. A model from another
provider is written `<provider>/<model id>`, such as
`deepseek-direct/deepseek-v4-pro`. That first segment is how the conversation remembers
where the model can be reached. With two or more connected providers, `/model` shows a dim
heading for each provider, default first, in the order shown in the Providers tab. A
custom provider's heading is the name you gave it.

The status line uses the same spelling: an unqualified default-provider id, and
`<provider>/<model id>` for every other provider. It does not shorten
`ollama/llama3.2:latest` to `llama3.2:latest`, because two providers may publish the
same model name. `via <host>` belongs only to a default-provider model with router
hosts. A direct-provider row and status line draw no `via` at all and open no host
sheet; that provider has one road, not a choice of hosts.

## Why does my plan show no cost instead of unbilled or could not be priced?

Phase 1 records no cost for a direct provider. Its calls therefore add nothing to the
spend page and show no invented `$0.00`. This does not mean the vendor charged nothing;
consult that account for its bill and limits.

When a direct stream ends before its usage block arrives, codeaf asks for no OpenRouter
receipt and writes no ledger row for that unmeasured call. `/cost` stays silent about it
rather than saying a subscription call was charged but could not be priced. Direct calls
whose usage block does arrive still record their model call and token counts without an
invented price.

A direct provider has one host, so there is no host picker and nothing to
choose between. That is not a fault. Price caps, privacy negotiation and provider routing
belong to the default routed provider and are not applied to a direct call.

## A local runner — Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp

Choose **Ollama** in `/connect` to use its usual local OpenAI-compatible address;
Ollama asks for no key. For LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp, or an Ollama address that is not
the usual one, choose **Custom OpenAI-compatible API**, then enter its base URL and any key that server
requires.

The connection check asks the local runner for its model list first. When it answers,
its models appear under the provider's heading in `/model`. A custom address that
fails this check remains editable with the error shown. A local
provider has one host, so there is nothing to choose between and that is not a fault.

## Custom OpenAI-compatible API — a proxy, a gateway, or your own endpoint

The **Custom OpenAI-compatible API** row in `/connect` accepts an OpenAI-compatible base URL and key.
Use it for a proxy, gateway, self-hosted endpoint, or vendor not already named. codeaf
checks the address before saving anything, then asks `name`. A key is requested only
when the model-list endpoint answers 401 or 403; an unsuccessful address check stays
editable and reports the error. The name
box opens on the host's own spelling: `localhost` for a local runner, `127-0-0-1` for
the loopback address, the host for anything else. Clearing the box takes that default
again. A name cannot carry `/` or a space, and a refused name reopens the box with the
reason: the slash is what separates provider from model in a model id, and a space
would travel into every id the provider qualifies. A name another provider or a
default-provider model author already uses is not asked twice about: codeaf takes an
available spelling (`localhost-direct`, then numbered ones) and the connect line names
what it used.

That name is the provider everywhere. It is the row's name in `/connect` and on the
Providers tab, the heading its models sit under in `/model`, and the first segment of
every model id it serves, so a model on a provider named `homelab` reads
`homelab/glm-5.3` and `/model homelab/glm-5.3` moves onto it. A refusal or a success
names the provider by the name it was given; neither switches back to `custom`.

Several custom providers coexist, each under the name you gave it, each with its own
key, its own rows and its own picker group. On /connect the **Custom OpenAI-compatible API** row
becomes that first provider's edit door once one is connected and a `+ add a
provider` row connects a new one; with none connected yet, **Custom OpenAI-compatible API** is the
door onto the first.

On the Providers tab in `/settings` each custom provider is a row of its own. `enter`
opens its available actions. Custom providers offer refresh, rename, change key,
and disconnect; rename reopens the address and name with their saved values. An
empty key box keeps the saved key. A changed name is a rename: every model id already picked under the old
name is re-spelled with the new one, the conversation's own pick first (a turn still
answering is waited out), and with it the stored ones: reasoning levels, the
worker, checker and planner pins, role pins, the fallback chain and the capability slots. A rename changes a label and nothing
else; it does not move the conversation onto a different model. `ctrl+r` on the row
reconnects with the saved details. The `+ add a provider` row checks the address and asks for a name,
requesting a key only when the server requires authentication, so the tab never sends you to `/connect` to add one.
The `active provider` row reads
`answering on localhost · enter moves it to homelab` and enter does that, wrapping past
the last provider back to the first; which one is active is read from the model the
conversation is on, so there is nothing else to store. The row is absent while no
custom provider is connected, and when the next one has no model list yet the move
says so instead: `no model list for homelab yet · reconnect it (ctrl+r on its row) or
type a model id in /model`.

In Phase 1 a **Custom OpenAI-compatible API** provider must provide the compatible chat path. codeaf
tries `GET <base>/models` first; the models from an answered list fill its picker group.
A new custom address must answer its model-list check before it can be saved. An
answered empty list leaves the picker asking you to type a model id. Direct calls record no cost in Phase 1 and have one host.
