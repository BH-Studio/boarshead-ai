// THE MODEL DOES NOT SEARCH THE PERSON'S WORDS (#307).
//
// A lookup on this manual is composed by a model, not typed by the person who
// wanted to know. Asked "who can see my files", `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`
// was measured sending "who can see my files privacy file access", "privacy
// files who can see my workspace", "who can see my files when I use codeaf" —
// and this corpus is a few dozen short sections, so two words nobody said move
// the ranking off the page. Those were the numbers then; the permissions
// section has since been reworded to carry the privacy and file-access terms,
// so only one of the three still misses and the rows in the test file carry
// stand-ins for the two that reach the page on their own now:
//
//	who can see my files                        → permissions, 2nd of 4
//	who can see my files when I use codeaf      → MISS
//	who can view my files in codeaf             → MISS
//	visibility of files in the workspace        → MISS
//
// The person's own words are the better question and the harness is holding
// them, so the search reads BOTH: the question as the model composed it, and
// the sentence the person actually typed. Nothing is asked of the model, no
// description tells it to quote anybody, and the retrieval the free tests
// measure on the person's exact words becomes the floor the live surface
// stands on rather than an ideal it drifts away from.
//
// THE RANKING HAS ONE RULE ABOVE SCORE: a section BOTH questions returned comes
// first. Two questions about the same thing agreeing on a section is stronger
// evidence than either one's number, and the numbers themselves are not
// comparable across questions — a longer question scores everything higher — so
// each side's scores are read against its own best before they are compared.

// theirWordsCap is how long the person's last message may be and still be read

//
// A question is a sentence. A message can also be a pasted document with a
// sentence somewhere in it, and BM25 over a thousand words returns whatever
// shares the most vocabulary with a document rather than what answers anything
// — the exact dilution this file exists to undo, arriving from the other side.
// Cutting a long message down would only choose which half to be diluted by,
// because the sentence sits above the paste as often as below it. So a message
// past this length is not read as a question at all: the model's query stands
// alone, which is what a lookup did before this file existed. No help, and no
// harm either.
//
// Four hundred bytes is about four lines of typing and seven times the longest
// question either set in internal/manual/asked puts, so every question those
// floors measure — and every question these pages were written for — is a long
// way inside it.
