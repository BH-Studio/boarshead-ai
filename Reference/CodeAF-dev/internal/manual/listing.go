package manual

// WHAT IS IN HERE, WRITTEN ONCE FOR EVERY SURFACE THAT ASKS.
//
// A person can be shown the manual from the command line and from the
// conversation, and both of them answer the same first question — which pages
// are there — so both of them read this listing rather than each formatting a
// list of names beside its own copy of where a title comes from. Two copies of
// that is how one surface ends up naming a page the other has renamed.

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"

// PageTitle is the title a page gives itself: its own `# ` line. The search
// stops at the first `## ` because everything past that is a section rather
// than a title, and the pages run to hundreds of kilobytes. A page with no
// title line is named the way this package names one anywhere else — its file
// name, with the dashes read as spaces.

// Listing is every page in this corpus, one per line, in reading order: the

// RenderWhole is [Render] for a person rather than for a model: a Markdown

// CUT under it.

// Render's [SectionBodyCap] is a budget, and it is the model's: a context window
// is paid for by the token, so a long section degrades there by truncation. A
// person reading their own manual is paying for none of that, and a page cut
// short on the surface where the whole of it is free would be a limit wearing a
// reason it does not have.

// — `## permissions · ` — so the command-line door and every test that reads
// what a person saw share one spelling. The model's bracketed form is
// [ModelSectionOpen]; the two must never be swapped, because a person reading

// renderSections is the arrangement itself, and there is one of it because the

// below zero cuts nothing. BY CONSTRUCTION NO SECTION BODY LINE BEGINS WITH
// `## `: split cuts a page at exactly that prefix, so the Markdown heading is
// the only such line in a person's answer. A `[` line is not unique — the
// compacting page quotes `[folded 31 messages · grep or read /home/x/...]`
// from the screen.
