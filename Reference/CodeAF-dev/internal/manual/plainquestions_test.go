// THE FLOORS ON QUESTIONS A STRANGER ASKS.
//
// The questions themselves, and the law about never rewriting one to make it
// pass, are in internal/manual/asked — a package of their own because
// internal/e2e measures the SAME twenty-five and the same held-out set through
// a live model, and two copies of the list would let the free number and the
// paid one stop being about the same thing.

// reach ranks one question and reports whether a wanted page came first and
// whether it came at all, within the sections the belt tool actually hands the
// model. It logs every row so a failure is read as a table rather than as one
// name, because a change to the scoring moves the whole table at once.
