// Package manual is what codeaf knows about itself, embedded in the binary.
//
// Everything codeaf can say about its own capabilities, mechanisms and reasons
// has to come from somewhere. The design docs are the wrong somewhere: they are
// on disk rather than in the binary, they are written to persuade rather than
// to answer, and they go stale the moment a build lands. Improvisation is the
// worse somewhere — a model asked "how does boost work" will always produce a
// fluent answer, and there is no way for the user to tell a remembered one from
// an invented one. So the pages here are the single authoritative source, they
// ship inside the binary, and the completeness tests beside the feature
// registries fail the build when a landed feature is not among them.
//
// TWO PRODUCTS, TWO FOLDERS, NO MIXING (corpus.go says why at length):
//
//   - pages/ is the RESIDENT — the employee that keeps working while the
//     terminal is closed. Read through this package's own functions, which is
//     the shape internal/head and internal/tui already call.
//   - chat/ is the V3 CHAT — the conversation surface in internal/tui3 over the
//     engine in internal/session. Read through [Chat].
//
// A page belongs to exactly one of them. When a mechanism genuinely exists in
// both products it is written twice, in each one's own vocabulary, because the
// two answers are not the same answer: the resident's is about work that
// outlives the window and the chat's is about the session you are sitting in.
package manual

// The pages ship packed, not raw: a megabyte of Markdown is otherwise a
// megabyte of binary, and a manual is the most compressible thing codeaf
// carries. internal/packed says how and why. The folders below are the only
// tracked source of truth. `make build` generates ignored archives and selects
// packed_source.go; ordinary Go commands select raw_source.go so a clean
// checkout still compiles without committing a shared binary merge hotspot.

//go:generate go run github.com/Agent-Field/codeaf/internal/packed/cmd/pack -o pages.pack.gz pages
//go:generate go run github.com/Agent-Field/codeaf/internal/packed/cmd/pack -o chat.pack.gz chat
