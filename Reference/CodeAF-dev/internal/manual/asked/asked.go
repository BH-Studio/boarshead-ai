// Package asked is the questions a STRANGER asks, and the page each one is
// about. It is test material and nothing in the shipped program imports it.
//
// It is a package of its own because two lanes have to measure the same
// questions or neither number means anything. internal/manual ranks them with
// no model in the loop, which is free and exact; internal/e2e puts them to a
// live model through the surface a person uses, which is what the model
// actually does with them (#307). A second copy of the list would let the two
// drift, and the day they drifted the comparison between them would quietly
// stop being a comparison.
package asked

// Question is one plain sentence about a topic and the page whose NAME is that
// topic. Want carries every page that fairly answers it, comma separated, and a
// question is reached when any of them comes back.
type Question struct{ Ask, Want string }

// Plain is TWENTY-FIVE QUESTIONS PHRASED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT READ THE
// HEADINGS.
//
// This is deliberately not the probe list in internal/manual's chat_test.go.
// That list is a ledger of everything the pages already answer, and it grew
// alongside them: its questions were written by the people writing the
// headings, so it measures the questions the pages were written for. It was
// green on 700+ probes while the twenty-five below reached their page first
// eleven times.
//
// So these are asked the other way round. Each one is a plain sentence about a
// topic, paired with the page whose NAME is that topic — no judgement calls, no
// phrasing lifted from a heading, nobody checking afterwards whether the page
// happens to use those words.
//
// THE LAW OF THIS LIST: a miss is fixed by making the page reachable, never by
// rewriting the question. Rewriting a question here turns the list into a
// second copy of the probe list, which is exactly the failure it exists to
// catch. Fix it in a `## ` heading written in the asker's own words, or in the
// scoring in corpus.go — and then check both floors in plainquestions_test.go,
// because a heading that rescues one question can bury another.

// HeldOut were written cold, before a line of the ranking change that produced
// them existed, and were not looked at again until it was finished. NOTHING IS
// EVER TUNED AGAINST THEM. Their whole worth is that no heading was written
// with them in view, so they measure what a stranger's first question actually
// meets; the moment one of them is answered by writing its words into a page,
// it stops measuring anything and this list is worse than it was.
//
// Their floor is therefore low, and is simply what they measured — a number to
// hold, not a number to chase. The gap between it and the floor above is the
// honest size of the difference between a question the pages were prepared for
// and a question they were not.
