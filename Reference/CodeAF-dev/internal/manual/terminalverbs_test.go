// THE TERMINAL HALF OF THE COMPLETENESS GATE.
//
// internal/tui3's manual_test.go checks every slash command and alias against
// this corpus, and internal/session's checks every tool on the belt. Neither of
// them could see a COMMAND-LINE VERB, and the hole was not theoretical: `why`,
// `notebook`, `competence`, `services`, `wake` and `rebuild` shipped for months
// with no mention anywhere in chat/. This corpus is the only authoritative
// source about codeaf for the model — its training data does not contain this
// program — so somebody who asked the running chat "how do I see what that task
// actually did?" was answered by an improvisation, or by a flat denial of a
// command the binary has always had.
//
// The bar is the same low bar the other two keep: the corpus must MENTION the
// verb, not describe it well. A test that graded prose is a test nobody could
// keep green; this one only insists that whoever wired a verb into the dispatch
// also opened the manual.
//
// IT LIVES HERE, in the package that owns the corpus, because it is the one
// place that can see BOTH halves: chat/ is beside it, and cmd/codeaf is read as
// source the way truth_test.go already reads it for the figures the pages quote.
// A test in cmd/codeaf could see the dispatch more directly and could not be run
// at all while another lane has that package mid-edit.
//
// THE VERBS ARE READ OUT OF THE TREE WITH go/parser rather than off a list,
// for two reasons. The first is that `knownCommands` is hand-kept while the
// dispatch switch in run() is what is actually true, so reading only the list
// would let a verb be dispatched, typed, and undocumented all at once. The
// second is mechanical: scripts/laws.sh finds the laws by this import, so a
// structural test written this way is on the pull-request gate the day it lands.
