// ── THE TERMINAL PAGE MAY NOT CLAIM A MEASUREMENT NOBODY TOOK ──────────────
//
// `running-from-the-terminal` described the `steps` key of the `--json` envelope
// as one a saved program "reports 0" for. `reports 0` tells a reader a
// measurement was taken and came back zero; a saved program does not count its
// steps at all, so the figure is an absence wearing a number's clothes, and a
// harness author reading that line writes `if steps == 0: nothing ran`.
//
// THE KEY ITSELF STAYS, AND THAT IS NOT THE EMPTINESS LAW LOSING. That law
// governs what a PERSON reads on a screen. `--json` is read by a program, and
// the envelope's written guarantee is that within a release a field is never
// removed and never changes meaning — a key that vanished when its number was
// unknown would break every caller that reaches for it. So what changes is the
// sentence, not the contract.
