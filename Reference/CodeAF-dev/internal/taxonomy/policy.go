//
//   - DEGENERATION IS WORTH ASKING ONCE MORE. If the same transcript comes back

//   - A CUT THAT REROUTED NOTHING IS WORTH ASKING ONCE MORE, and for a harder
//     reason: nothing moved. Routing is off, or the stream died before any chunk
//     named who served it, so the next ask lands in the same place by the same
//     rules and a second one buys nothing at all.
//   - SILENCE THAT DID REROUTE IS WORTH ASKING TWICE MORE. A quiet endpoint is
//     very often a bad draw out of a pool, and the asks after it are genuinely
//     served by somebody else.
