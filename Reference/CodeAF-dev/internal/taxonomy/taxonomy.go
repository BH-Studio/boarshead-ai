// Package taxonomy is the response boundary: the one place in this build that
// answers "what kind of failure was that?" and hands back what to do about it.
//
// ── WHY THERE IS A BOUNDARY AT ALL ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Three completely different things used to arrive at the harness looking the
// same, and each site answered for itself:
//
//   - A TRANSPORT failure — an endpoint that refused, stalled, or answered with
//     an empty 200 — read as the MODEL being unable to do the work, which bought
//     a stronger tier that was never needed. On a measured five-run comparison
//     that misreading was 57–82% of the bill on three of the runs ($9.5–15.8
//     each), while the run that never rolled four bad responses in a row cost
//     $2.33 in total.
//   - A TRANSPORT failure read as "the turn is over": an empty 200 was written
//     down once and the loop stopped, ending a whole run eighteen minutes in.
//   - A TRANSPORT failure read as "wait forever": an errand's deadline was
//     logged and dropped with nothing said about it.
//
// None of those is a judgement about the work, and until this package none of
// them could be told apart from one.
//
// ── THE FOUR CLASSES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// [Transport] is the wire: nobody answered, or somebody answered with something
// that was not an answer. It is retried on the SAME tier with the endpoint
// rotated underneath, it never ends a turn, and it NEVER counts toward buying a
// stronger model — because it says nothing whatever about the model.
//
// [Capability] is the model: a fresh check read the work and found it wanting,
// on a tier that had every chance. That, and only that, is what buys a lift —
// after [Limits.SemanticFailures] of them, under a cost cap, and it comes back
// down again the moment a check passes.
//
// [Work] is the work: the job could not be done. There is nothing to retry and
// nothing to buy, so this package takes no action at all and hands the verdict to
// the caller with the evidence on it.
//
// [Shape] is the REQUEST: a transcript longer than the model's window, or bytes
// the router itself read and refused. It joined the other three on 2026-09-10,
// and what stood where it belongs was a pair of regexes in internal/session's
// turn loop that ran over the provider's prose AFTER the verdict was computed and
// returned before the verdict could be read. Its moves are real — make the
// request smaller, or change its shape — which is why it is not [Work].
//
// ── ONE BOUNDARY, NOT A SWITCH IN EVERY CALLER ──────────────────────────────
//
// [Classify] is the only entry. It reads the evidence into a class, looks the
// class's single [Policy] out of the registry, and returns that policy's
// [Verdict]. The numbers the policies read are [Limits], which a caller resolves
// once from the person's settings — so N, K and the cap are configuration in one
// file rather than constants sprinkled across the sites that happen to need
// them.

	// IT IS SEPARATE FROM Work BECAUSE ITS MOVE IS REAL. The job is fine and the

	// the verdict was read.
	//
	// It is asked once per turn. [Evidence.Compacted] says the turn has already

	// this field existed it was indistinguishable from one: the measured turn of
	// 2026-09-10 ended on `the request itself was refused` for a 404 that an
	// account's privacy setting had produced, and the same words sent again a

	// a privacy switch, a paid-training guardrail, a standing ignore list — so
	// it is true of every model and not of this one, and no machine was asked.
	//
	// It is a narrowing of Routing and never a substitute for it: both are set
	// together, because the MOVE is the same (somewhere else) and only the
	// journal line and the ledger care which list it was. It is here so that the
	// ledger's reading and the control answer come off ONE piece of evidence:

	// ITS MOVE IS THE MODEL AND NOTHING ELSE, which is why it is a field rather
	// than a shade of Routing. There is no machine to rotate to and no shape to

	// IT IS STRUCTURAL AND NEVER A PHRASE. The old test was a seven-alternative
	// regex over the provider's prose (`context.?length|token.?limit|…`) run
	// forty lines after the verdict had already been computed, and it returned
	// before the verdict could be read — so a routing 404 whose sentence

	// person configured sits unasked, which is the failure
	// docs/design/recovery/DESIGN.md §5 is written about.

	// used to answer "is there another try in this" from a number; the number is

	// same deadline and two budgets on one axis multiply. What is NOT said here
	// is anything about the failure: the reason a person reads stays the shape
	// that actually failed — a refusal, a reset, a reply that arrived empty —
	// where [Spent] would say "no shape of this request could be served", which
	// is a different claim and usually a false one.

	// full ladder with its waits; a stream that was cut is not — the request
	// succeeded and the reply came apart — so it earns a shorter allowance with
	// no wait in front of it. One model, one budget, two ways to spend it.
	Cuts int

	Degenerate bool

	// Rerouted says this cut actually took an endpoint out of the caller's
	// routing, so the attempts after it are genuinely served by somebody else.
	//
	// FALSE IS THE CASE THAT MATTERS. A cut that struck nothing — routing turned

	// Rerouted false with a pool means the next attempt lands in the same place

// classOf is the taxonomy itself, and the ORDER OF ITS QUESTIONS IS THE WHOLE
// ARGUMENT: the cheap explanation is asked first, every time.
//
//  1. A check that PASSED is the only good news here and it is a fact about the
//     model, so it goes to the capability policy, which is the only one that
//     knows how to give a tier back.
//  2. Then every transport shape. An empty 200, arguments that did not parse, a
//     cut stream, a deadline, a silent subprocess — none of them is evidence
//     about the model, and reading any of them as one is what bought the bill.
//  3. Then the REQUEST'S OWN SHAPE, before any status is read. A transcript that
//     did not fit the window is not a fact about a machine or about a model, and
//     it arrives under whatever status the router felt like using — so asking
//     the status first would file it as the wire or as the work depending on the
//     day.
//  4. Then WHO REFUSED, and only after that the status. A refusal that NAMED an
//     upstream is that upstream's and another endpoint may serve it, whatever
//     number it wore — this is the shape the measured 400s arrived in and the
//     shape nine out of ten measured 429s arrive in ([Evidence.Named]). Then the
//     status: 5xx is the wire by definition, and a 429 that named nobody is the
//     account's own ceiling, which is the wire with no machine to move to.
//     So is a ROUTING refusal (the account's own settings included): the router
//     emptied its endpoint set on a list or a setting, nobody was asked, and
//     somewhere else can serve it. So is a WITHDRAWN model, whose somewhere else
//     is another model rather than another machine. A 4xx that named nobody and
//     is none of those is the router reading OUR OWN BYTES and saying no, which
//     no endpoint will fix but a different request might: that is the shape.
//  5. Only then, a finding: a check that read the finished work and named gaps,
//     with the wire ruled out above. Whether that finding BUYS anything is the
//     capability policy's question and not this one.
//  6. Anything left is work.
