// The last seam a deliverable crosses before a person reads it, proved rather
// than assumed. When the UX suite found final messages that were plans and
// pointers, the announcer was one of four places the answer could have been lost
// — a summariser here, or a receipt about the work, would have made every fix
// upstream invisible. It is neither: what the work said is what the thread says,
// to the byte, with the file list the work wrote riding along inside it.
//
// So the fix for the plan-shaped non-answer belongs upstream, in the leaf
// contract and the delivery gate, and this test is what says so.
