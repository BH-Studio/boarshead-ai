// Decomposition at claim time: the depth loop, moved out of the build and into
// the scheduler.
//
// A plan built at t=0 decides every division it will ever make against titles,
// because at t=0 nothing has run and titles are all there are. The measured
// consequence was a graph that was the same shape in every run of the battery
// — two levels, decided before the first leaf started, never revisited — and a
// node that turned out to hold four workers' worth of work could only be
// discovered by spending a whole leaf budget failing at it and paying for a
// replan afterwards.
//
// So the question moves to the one moment it can be answered well: a node is
// claimed, every piece feeding it has landed and said what it produced, and the
// same two calls the build would have spent are spent here instead — against
// what is really there. The node either divides, and its parts run at the same
// time under it, or it does not, and the worker that is already holding it runs
// it whole. Refusing is the null hypothesis and it is free: the question that
// decides costs no call at all (plan.JudgeSplit reads the node), so a job whose
// every node is atomic pays exactly what it paid before this file existed.
//
// Everything that grows a running job goes through growJob, and this is no
// exception — it is the fourth caller, and the one whose rounds are counted per
// node rather than per job, because two siblings that each divide once have
// divided once each.
