// commandWall bounds the whole application of one command — every model call
// it makes, plus the store work between them.
//
// IT IS COUNTED IN CALLS, BECAUSE A COMMAND IS A SEQUENCE OF THEM. A splice waits
// on its structuring rounds one after another — the compile, the grounding
// beside the spine, the fan-out, the contracts, the title: [spliceRounds] — and
// each round is one walled call, whose longest honest life is the provider
// pool's [pool.LongestCall]: a completion that thought to its wall and the one
// ask for the answer it reached. The rail is the product of the two, so it
// admits the worst honest command and is still a rail: past it, a command is
// not slow, something in it is gone.
//
// WHAT IT USED TO SAY AND WHY IT STOPPED BEING TRUE. It was ten minutes, argued
// as "roughly twice the worst honest case and nowhere near any observed one".
// Issue #927 observed one, twice in a row, on a request nobody would call
// dishonest: GLM 5.3 on a long request compiled for 225 seconds, grounded for
// the whole four-minute call wall, and was still in its spine and fan-out when
// ten minutes struck both commands. A round on a reasoning model is minutes, not
// seconds, and a rail that does not know how many rounds a command has is a
// guess about how fast somebody else's model thinks.
//
// A plan deep enough to expand level by level runs more rounds than it counts,
// and runs them inside the rest of the rail: every round is now told how long
// it has (the thinking budget the wall implies), so an honest round lands inside
// one call wall and the second wall each round is allowed is room the rounds
// that did not need it leave behind.
//
// It is a per-command wall, not a per-tick one. A tick applying four
// independent splices concurrently gives each of them its own rail; the point
// is that no single command can own the queue forever, not that the resident
// must finish a batch by a clock.
const commandWall = spliceRounds * pool.LongestCall

// spliceRounds is how many structuring rounds a splice waits on one after the
// other when nothing in it is expanded: the compile, the grounding and the spine
// (which run side by side, so they are one round), the fan-out, the contracts,
// and the title. It is the only count in [commandWall], and it is a count of the
// pipeline rather than a tuning of it.
const spliceRounds = 5

// commandStrikeLimit is how many times a command may stall before the person is
// told it is not going to happen.
//
// Two, because the failure this guards is a hung socket and the cure for a hung
// socket is a new one. A first stall is not evidence about the request — it is
// evidence about one connection to one provider — so terminally rejecting a
// perfectly good ask on it would be the watchdog inventing a failure the system
// did not have. A second stall is a different claim: whatever is wrong is not
// the connection, and continuing to retry silently is how a card pulses
// "creating task…" forever.
const commandStrikeLimit = 2

// stalledReceipt is what the person reads when a command has run out of time
// twice. It names what happened in their terms and hands back the one action
// that actually requeues the work, because a receipt that only reports a failure
// leaves somebody staring at a card wondering whether to retype the request.
//
// THE CAUSE IT NAMES IS THE TRUE ONE. It said "the model stopped answering" until
// issue #927, and in the run that filed it every call's first token arrived in
// under a second and the model was still thinking when each wall struck. Silence
// never reaches this receipt — a stream that stops writing is cut by the stream
// guard with a sentence of its own, which is not a deadline — so a command that
// died of time is a model that was working past it.
const stalledReceipt = "I couldn't get this planned — " + ranOutOfTime + " twice. " +
	"Say 'try again' to requeue it."

// ranOutOfTime is the cause, and it is POOL'S SPELLING and not a second copy of
// it. The same phrase has to appear in the sentences here — the stage note a
// stalled command shows while it is tried again, and the receipt it ends on —
// and in every planning fault a person reads on the way there
// ([pool.CauseInWords], which cmd/codeaf's plan notes go through). Two constants
// saying the same thing would drift the day one of them was reworded.
const ranOutOfTime = pool.RanOutOfTime

// stalled reports that a command died of time rather than of anything about
// the request.
//
// The two clauses are both load-bearing. errors.Is against DeadlineExceeded is
// what catches both walls — the per-call one wraps it deliberately, so this
// question is asked of the error and never of which package raised it.
// The check on the outer context is what keeps a shutdown from being read as a
// provider stall: when the process is going away every command in flight
// reports a deadline, and striking them would rewrite an orderly exit as a
// workforce failure.

// a command's model calls actually receive is the bounded one.

// settleOrStrike is the watchdog's settlement half: it decides whether what
// came back from applying a command is an answer or a stall.
//
// An answer — applied, refused, or failed for any reason that is about the
// request — settles exactly as it always did. A stall does not settle at all,
// and that is the whole mechanism: a command is only ever removed from the
// pending queue by ResolveCommand, so declining to call it leaves the command
// exactly where it was, and the next tick re-reads it and tries again. There is
// no re-pend to write, and nothing durable to keep in step — a restart re-reads
// the same pending row and starts the count over, which is the right answer for
// a count that is about one process's luck with one provider.
//
// It reports whether the command was left pending, which the drain loop reads:
// re-reading the queue in the same tick would retry a stall against the same
// wedged provider within microseconds, which is not a retry, it is the second
// strike arriving early.
