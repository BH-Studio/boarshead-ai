// §4. The arrival brief said "$0.0023" in its header and "$0.00 spent" in its
// own bullet, two lines apart, about one number. The header is drawn by the
// surface and the bullet is written here, so the two have to agree by test:
// nothing in the type system makes a sentence and a badge climb the same
// ladder.
//
// The bound is the range a brief reports. Past a thousand dollars the header
// abbreviates to a count while the sentence spells the figure out, which is a
// difference of resolution between two true renderings and never of rounding.
