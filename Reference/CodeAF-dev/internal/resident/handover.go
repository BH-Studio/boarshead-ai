// HandoverFunc is asked to give up the resident role. It answers whether the
// role will actually be released and says why in the words the requester and
// the journal both read.

// It is called from inside a tick, so it must return promptly: releasing a
// lease, draining a runner and stopping a head all belong to the goroutine the
// implementation starts, not to the pass that is still holding the command
// queue open.
