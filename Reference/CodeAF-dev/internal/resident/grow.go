// One governor for every way a running job grows.
//
// Growth used to be bounded in as many places as it happened. The overrun path
// held both caps and enforced them inline; the delivery gate inherited them by
// calling that path; and the revision sentinel — the mechanism that adds work
// because a landed result contradicted the plan — spliced straight into the job
// root with no ceiling, no round counter and no rail check at all. Three paths,
// two of which were governed by accident and one not at all, and afterwards
// nothing could tell an overrun replan from a sentinel add without reading
// intents node by node.
//
// So every execution-time add asks the same question of the same helper, and
// the answer is journaled against the job it grew. The order of the checks is
// cheapest first, and it ends with the only one that costs money: is the goal
// already covered? That question is the reason the criterion exists. Rounds,
// nodes and dollars all answer "have we done too much"; none of them answers
// "is there anything left to do", which is why a job could spend three
// legitimate rounds inventing verification of the round before it and be
// refused only by arithmetic, long after the money was gone.
