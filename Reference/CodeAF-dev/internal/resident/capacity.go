// the measured history says is less likely to exceed one worker's envelope, so
// the runner fills the pool with the work most likely to land cheaply while a
// costlier part is still being divided.

// The base rate is the same for every node of one model, so it does not reorder
// siblings the planner sized equally — those tie, and the caller keeps the order
// it was handed. The size does the ordering, and only once the fold has
// measured evidence to back it: a node the planner called oversized is predicted
// to overrun (it already exceeds one worker), an atomic one carries only the
// measured residual rate, and a borderline one falls between. ok is false when
// the fold has no evidence, and the caller must leave the order untouched.
