// Changing the model under a running job used to mean cancelling it. Restart
// inheritance carried a pin forward onto fresh nodes, and nothing at all moved
// a pin on nodes that already existed — so the only way to answer "this is
// going badly, use the better one" was to throw the work away and ask again.
//
// This arm is the other answer, and it is deliberately the calm one: it moves
// the pin and touches nothing else. Steps that have not started pick up the new
// model when they are claimed; steps already in flight finish on the model they
// were handed. Wanting it immediate is two explicit acts — cancel the turn, then
// switch — and never one silent one.

// setModel applies CommandSetModel: Target names the subtree, Instruction names
// the model. The model is carried in the instruction rather than in a new
// column for the reason CommandExpedite records — replay stays a switch on the
// verb, and no command row grows a field for one kind's sake. Reasoning effort
// rides inside the same string, because the pin it writes is one slug and the
// graph has never had a second axis to put an effort on.
