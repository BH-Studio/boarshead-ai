// The cooperative half of decomposition: a leaf that found the split rather
// than failed into it.
//
// Every other way a running job grows begins with something going wrong. The
// overrun path needs a leaf to spend its whole budget first; the delivery gate
// needs a reviewer to find the result short; the revision sentinel needs a
// landed result to contradict the plan. Claim-time division (jit.go) was the
// first that did not, and it asks its question of a node that has not started —
// against the plan document and what landed into it, which is everything
// knowable before the work begins and nothing that is learned by doing it.
//
// This is the case neither of them reaches: the agent is holding the material,
// has opened it, and can see that what it was handed is four jobs. Until now
// the only way it could say so was to run out of money, and the graph would
// then grow from the wreckage of a leaf that had known the answer for twenty
// minutes. So the worker gets a verb for it, and what it says goes through the
// same governor, the same expansion call and the same splice the failures use —
// because a request from a worker is evidence, not authority, and the one thing
// that must not follow from adding a cheap way to grow a job is a cheap way to
// grow a job.
