// A pass is written as a sequence of independent lanes, and that is deliberate:
// no lane may assume another one already asked the store something, because the
// order they run in is a scheduling detail and the one before it may have
// written. The cost of that independence is that the same read is taken two,
// three, a dozen times in one pass — every unresolved question, the whole
// active view, every taste verdict — and on the overwhelmingly common pass none
// of the lanes in between wrote a thing, so every one of those reads returns
// the bytes the last one returned.
//
// Hoisting the read by hand removes the cost and the guarantee together: the
// write in between is rare, but when it happens the later reader MUST see it,
// and a slice hoisted to the top of the pass silently would not. So the sharing
// is made conditional instead of unconditional, and the condition is the thing
// that already summarizes "has anything at all changed" — the journal
// watermark. Every write to this store appends to it; reading it is one indexed
// lookup through a prepared statement. A caller is handed the previous answer
// only where re-deriving would provably have produced the same one.

// whenever anything at all is waiting — a clock deadline, the standing ceiling
// that fires every thirty seconds however still the store is — and every lane
// in it then re-derives from scratch. For a lane whose derivation is a scan of
// the fact shelf and a walk of the filesystem, that is the difference between
// asking the operating system twice a second and asking it twice a minute, and
// the two ask exactly the same question of exactly the same bytes.

// timedMemo holds a derivation for a fixed span of wall clock, for the one read

// something HAS been written gets no benefit from it at all — the memo would
// miss every single time — and the practice loop is exactly that lane. So its
// one very expensive derivation is held for a span instead, and the span is
// chosen against what reads it: practice fires at most twice a day, behind a
// twenty-minute idleness test and a one-minute charter poll, so a metric up to
// a minute old changes no decision that clock is capable of making.
