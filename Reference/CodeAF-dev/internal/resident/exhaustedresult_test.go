// used to read as an ordinary finish and settle the node done over a leaf that
// was still working when its grant ran out. The headless run of 2026-09-01
// journaled `leaf_exhausted` and, two seconds later, `node_completed` with the
// leaf's own last line of prose as its summary. Exhaustion is a measured fact;
// doneness is a claim.
