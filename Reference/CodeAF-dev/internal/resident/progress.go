// What a round actually moved, weighed against what the job is about.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS ANSWERS. ink s10 was given a 5400-second wall and spent all
// of it. One lineage — task-2 → x1 → x2 → x3 — exhausted eight times, resumed
// three, and every round of it was admitted by the growth governor because
// every round had "produced" something: `debug-grid.ts`, `debug-grid2.ts`,
// `debug-grid3.tsx`, `debug-grid10.ts`, `debug-grid11.ts`, `debug-yoga.ts`,
// `debug-yoga2.ts`, `debug-test2.tsx`, `debug-test3.tsx`, `debug-grid-pos.tsx`.
// A model that is stuck writes scratch files, and a scratch file is a file, so
// the standstill rule — which was right, and which is the only rule in the
// governor that asks whether anything was ACHIEVED — saw motion on every round
// and never once spoke. What stopped the run was the round cap, four rounds and
// ninety minutes later, with the wall gone, no gate cut, and `settled: false`.
//
// So the reading of "did this round move something" is narrowed to the work:
//
//   - EVERY CHECK FILE COUNTS. A check the run wrote is the one thing a job can
//     produce that is progress on its own terms whatever else happened, and it
//     is what the coverage finding exists to buy. verify.OwnChecks decides what
//     a check is, by the runner's own naming convention and by nothing else.
//   - A CHANGED SOURCE COUNTS WHEN THE JOB IS ABOUT IT. The job's focus is what
//     its request names: the paths the request spells that this workspace holds,
//     and the names it uses resolved against the workspace by verify.Locate —
//     the identical reading internal/exec takes to decide how much of a project
//     to verify — plus the adjacency verify.Adjacent's first rank defines: a
//     file named after something in the focus, or sitting in a directory the
//     focus is in. `debug-grid.ts` at a repository root beside `package.json` is
//     neither, and `src/grid.ts` is both.
//   - A FILE THE REQUEST NAMES IS NEVER SCRATCH. The spelling comes first and
//     the resolution second, because a resolution is a search and a search can
//     come back without a file the request wrote out in full. See jobFocus.
//   - A JOB THAT NAMED NOTHING IS ABOUT EVERYTHING. An empty focus is verify's
//     own "reading of the whole project", and the fail-safe direction here is
//     the same: with nothing to narrow by, every changed source counts and the
//     governor keeps exactly the bounds it had.
//
// NO FILENAME PATTERN APPEARS ANYWHERE IN THIS FILE. `debug-` is a spelling one
// model happened to choose, and a rule written against it would be one spelling
// behind forever (FAILSAFE clause 1). What is structural is the relationship
// between what the round wrote and what the request is about, and that
// relationship is one verify already computes for its own reasons.
