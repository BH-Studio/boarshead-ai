	// work. Nothing that runs after that ✓ can recover the cut work.

	// retired over work that was still going — the very defect this seam exists

// party to the transaction and does not notice. On the ink run of 2026-08-29 the
// reaper released `task-2` at 07:30:13 and a fresh worker claimed it 17
// milliseconds later, while the first one went on making model calls and editing
// the same checkout for another eleven minutes — the store shows both streams
// interleaved under one node, turns 1-25 of the new attempt flushed between
// turns 45 and 67 of the old one. Two workers, one workspace, each undoing the
// other's edits.
//
// So the claim is not what gets taken. The WORKER gets cancelled — every leaf
// runs on a context this process can end, and the bare loop and its tool calls
// already honour it — and the node stays exactly as it is, Running and
// unclaimable, until that worker's own landing releases it. The release
// therefore happens after the goroutine has provably returned, which is the only
// moment at which the node is genuinely held by nobody.

// cancellation for that long is not unwinding, it is gone, and the claim is

// ── the claim reaper's window, and why it is a backstop ─────────────────────
//
// IT IS NOT THE DETECTOR, AND ON 2026-08-28 IT WAS ACTING AS ONE. A provider
// call hung; nothing in the call path noticed, because the guard that watches a
// stream for silence was armed only when somebody was watching the stream
// (internal/provider's CompleteWithMessages, and the law stated there). So the
// first thing in the whole system to react was this reaper, twenty minutes
// later, whose only available reaction is the bluntest one there is: take the
// node away from the worker holding it and let somebody claim it again. It did
// that three times to one leaf and the run produced nothing.
//
// The detector belongs where the failure is: the guard cuts a silent call in
// ninety seconds, the ledger routes around the endpoint that went quiet, and the
// worker's own loop asks the CALL again with everything it had still in hand. By
// the time a claim is old enough to interest this reaper, every one of those has
// been tried and the claim is genuinely held by nobody — which is the only case
// a reaper can be right about.
//
// So the window is sized to be OUT OF THE WAY rather than to be timely. It is
// the leaf executor's own deadline plus a landing pad, and it is RAISED by
// [Runner.RaiseStaleAge] whenever a surface grants a leaf a longer one, because
// a reaper that fires below a worker's own deadline is not a backstop — it is
// the thing that fires first.
//
// AND ON 2026-08-29 THAT WAS STILL NOT ENOUGH, because a window is only as good
// as what it is measured against. The window below came out at twenty-two
// minutes — fifteen for the executor's own deadline, two for the watchdog above
// it, five for the pad — and the reaper measured it from the claim's start. So
// it fired on the ink run at 22m10s, 22m10s, 22m11s and 22m06s, four times, at a
// leaf that was calling the model throughout: one claim legitimately carries the
// executor's deadline AND the retry a spent deadline earns, which is twice this
// window, and the clock could not tell that from a corpse. The window is now
// measured from the node's last SIGN OF LIFE (store.ReleaseSilent), so it bounds
// SILENCE rather than work, and a leaf that keeps calling keeps its claim for as
// long as it keeps calling.
const (
	// claimReaperPad is how far above a worker's own deadline the reaper sits:
	// the room a leaf told to land needs to write its result and release its

	// is failed with the ending named rather than handed round again for ever.

	// cmd/codeaf's regrantAfterRunningOut) — so a re-dispatch that reaches no
	// further than the attempt before it has been paid to move and did not, and
	// it is failed with the refusal named rather than sent round to buy the
	// same truncated ending again. The count it is measured against is the one
	// the hand-on release journaled: that row is the record's own answer to
	// what the attempt before banked, and reading it beats keeping a second
	// copy on the claim.
	//
	// A PASSED DELIVERY GATE SETTLES THE NODE. Running out is a statement about
	// RESOURCES — the meter reached its bound while the worker was still going —
	// and a gate pass is a statement about the WORK, taken by reading the result
	// against the words the person used. "Is this done" is the work's question,

	// buys a second run of work that is already finished and judged.
