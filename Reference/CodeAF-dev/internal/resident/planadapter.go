// SubtreeFromPlan converts a planned graph into the store's admission shape:
// the deliverable owner becomes the subtree root and every other node its
// child, so the goal lands last and the whole subtree reads as one task.
//
// A node's Group is display provenance and only that. It used to carry one
// structural marker as well — the synthesis of a declared bundle, which the
// executor read to skip the model and join the parts by hand. That marker was
// a claim only the bundle route could make: its leaves were the person's own
// requests, verbatim and self-contained, so concatenating them was assembly.
// A planned subtree makes no such promise about its leaves — they are as often
// fragments of one deliverable — so the claim went out with the route that
// could support it, and the gathering node writes its own delivery like every
// other gathering node in the system.

// planShape is the admission reading of a planned graph: which nodes an
// executor would actually run, and which of them is the subtree's root.
//
// It exists as one function because two files used to answer the root question
// differently and neither could see the other. See PlanStoreIDs.
//
// grown names plan nodes minted after the subtree was admitted — a revision's
// own adds. They are read out of the shape entirely, because the root is a fact
// about the plan the store already holds: an added node that consumes the sink
// would otherwise become the new sink and silently rename a store node that was
// minted minutes ago and cannot be renamed.
