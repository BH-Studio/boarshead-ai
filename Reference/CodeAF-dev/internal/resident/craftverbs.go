// The four verbs a person can aim at what the resident has LEARNED, as opposed
// to what it is doing: run this way of working, put it back to the version
// before this one, stop reaching for it, take that tool off the shelf.
//
// They arrive as ordinary journaled commands and are applied here, beside the
// charter and service verbs, for the reason every other door in this system is
// one command kind: a verb that acted from the surface and a verb that acted
// from a sentence would otherwise be two implementations of one promise, and
// the one nobody was looking at would be the one that stopped being true.
//
// Nothing here deletes anything. A retired craft keeps its file, its versions
// and everything it proved; a reverted one gains a version rather than losing
// one; a retired tool keeps its installed directory as the evidence of where it
// came from. Retirement is the resident being told to stop offering something,
// which is a different act from destroying it, and only one of the two is
// reversible by hand.

// craftReverter is the repository's own revert, asked for as a capability
// rather than added to [CraftShelf]. The shelf interface is what recognition
// and forging need, and every test in this package scripts it; widening it for
// one verb would make every one of those fakes carry a method they never call.
// *craft.Repo satisfies this; a shelf that does not simply cannot revert, and
// says so in words.
