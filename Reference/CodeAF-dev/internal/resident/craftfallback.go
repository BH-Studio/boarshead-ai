// A provisional craft run is an experiment the user is lent, not one they
// signed up for. craftmind's three-state evidence rule gives a never-run
// workflow exactly one run at the decisive bar, and says so out loud — "first
// time working this way; say 'from scratch' if you'd rather I plan it". The
// second half of that bargain was never built. When the experiment failed, the
// job settled failed, the craft went behind the overwhelming bar, and the
// person's REQUEST died with the experiment: they asked for something, we tried
// a shortcut we had never tried, the shortcut broke, and the answer to their
// question was a stack trace.
//
// This file is the other half. A provisional run that fails replans the same ask
// the ordinary way — compiled and planned, with the shelf never consulted — and
// says so in one line. The evidence still counts against the craft; that part
// already worked and is untouched here.
//
// THREE THINGS THIS MUST NOT BECOME.
//
//  1. A second replan authority. It borrows the overrun path's governors whole:
//     the same lineage arithmetic, the same growJob gate, the same round cap and
//     job ceiling and daily rail. A fallback that spent outside the governors
//     would be the 27-round incident with a new name on it.
//
//  2. A loop. The replacement is planned WITHOUT a craft, so its provenance
//     carries no craft reference, so a second failure cannot reach this code at
//     all. The round cap is the belt behind that brace.
//
//  3. A way to hide real news. A PROVEN craft failing is a fact about a way of
//     working the person relies on, and quietly replanning around it would be the
//     system covering for itself. Only the unproven draft gets rescued.
