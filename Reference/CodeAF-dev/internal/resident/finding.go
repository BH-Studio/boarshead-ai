// A finding has its own fixed point.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS ANSWERS. happy-dom v4-flash s13 was given 5400 seconds and a
// gate that was right. Four delivery judgements in a row carried ONE finding —
// "this work removed checks that existed before it", citing
// `IntersectionObserver disconnect() Does nothing` and three siblings, the same
// four names in the same order every time — and each of them bought a repair
// round. Every round changed files the job was about, so the standstill rule
// correctly saw motion; every round was handed a differently-worded remainder
// on the paths that read prose, so nothing there matched either. What stopped
// the run was arithmetic, `cause: rounds`, forty minutes and $0.135 later, at
// 9 of 14 hidden checks — where the same task on the previous seed, working the
// same problem, reached 12.
//
// A round is bought FOR something. The thing it was bought for is the finding
// the gate raised, and whether it moved is a question about that finding and
// about nothing else: not about the tree, which a stuck model changes freely,
// and not about the review's paragraph, which a model rewords for free. So the
// finding travels with the round that was bought for it, is journaled beside
// it, and is compared against the next round's — kind and cited names, from the
// structured record, never from the sentence.
