// Banking: what an attempt that died on the clock hands to the one that takes
// over from it.
//
// The incident this file exists for ran for the better part of an hour. A craft
// job's root leaf implemented four classification algorithms, benchmarked them
// against RBF-SVM on three datasets, posted a progress row at every step, and at
// 20:13:51 said "The comparison writeup for all four algorithms is now pulled
// together into one document". Nine minutes later its first attempt hit its time
// ceiling. At 20:22:06 the retry began — and it began COLD, with an empty
// context, in a workspace already holding the writeup, rebuilding from nothing
// what the journal could have told it in twenty lines.
//
// Nothing was missing except the handover. The graph already knows how to say
// "here is what the last agent got to, do not do it again": OverrunGoal has
// composed exactly that for every re-decomposed leaf since the overrun path was
// built, and its two headers are the whole of the contract. This file makes the
// same two headers reachable from the OTHER two ways an attempt ends and starts
// over — the in-place retry, and the requeue at launch after the process
// carrying the work went away — so a leaf that ran out of clock never loses what
// it had.
//
// The bank is not a new record. Every line of it is already in the journal
// (node-anchored progress rows, board notes) or already on disk (the workspace's
// own files). What was missing was somebody reading them back.

// recorder writes them under the node and flushes on every way out of a leaf.
// Nothing read them back.
//
// The bank already knew how to hand a dead attempt's work to its successor. What

// is turn 1, "Let me start by examining the existing codebase", followed by
