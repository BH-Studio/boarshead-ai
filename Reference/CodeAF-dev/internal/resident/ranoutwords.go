// one file because they are one account of one event told to three different
// endings, and a reader who meets them a day apart must not have to work out
// whether they are describing the same thing.
//
// EACH ONE NAMES THREE FACTS AND NOTHING ELSE: what stopped the leaf, how far it
// had got by the meter that measured it, and what survives for whoever comes
// next. The first of those was missing for as long as these sentences were
// composed from the meter alone — the meter is named "cost" and the bound that
// fired is the budget, so a node handed back for running out of its tokens said
// only `cost: 178086 of 176834`, which names the reading and not the ending. A
// person reading a run should not have to know that "cost" is the instrument.

// ranOutWords opens both sentences: the leaf was still working, and this is what
// it ran out of. The word for the bound is [executor.RanOutSubject], which is
// the same word the record and the headless stream use at the moment the leaf
// stops, so the two ends of the seam cannot name the ending differently.

// stopped answering — and both sentences end by saying how much survived and
// that the next claim starts from it. The headless stream then cuts that clause
// back off, because the line it writes says the count in its own words and a
// line that said it twice would read as two different numbers (see
// [ReleaseWhy], and cmd/codeaf's narrateOne on store.EventNodeReleased). A join
// and a cut that each carried their own copy of the wording would drift apart on
// the first edit, so there is one copy and the cut is derived from it.
