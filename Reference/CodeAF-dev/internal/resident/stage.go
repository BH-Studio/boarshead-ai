//
// These are the reconciler's half of a sequence the planner already writes the
// middle of. Everything between "reading the request" and "setting working
// standards" has posted a row for as long as plan progress has existed; the two
// ends never did. A splice is a compile, then a plan, then a title, then the
// graph write, and only the plan ever said anything — so a card that had been
// pulsing "creating task…" for ninety seconds was, as far as any surface could
// tell, doing nothing, whether it was mid-compile or wedged forever.
//
// The vocabulary is the planner's own (internal/plan/progress.go): a surface
// reads Phase and draws it, so a new word here would be a new word on the card.
// "reading the request" is deliberately the same phase the planner's grounding
// pass uses — it is the same phase from the person's side, and a surface that
// collapses consecutive identical rows is right to collapse them.
