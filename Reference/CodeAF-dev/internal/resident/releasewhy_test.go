// THE CUT AND THE JOIN ARE ONE FACT, SO THEY ARE TESTED AGAINST EACH OTHER.
//
// The headless ↻ line says how many turns it picked up in its own words and then
// names the bound that fired, which it reads off the release reason — and the
// reason ends with a clause saying that same count. If the cut and the clause
// ever spell the seam differently, nothing goes red: the line simply starts
// carrying the number twice, three words apart, which is exactly the shape of
// the defect this whole sentence exists to avoid. So every reason this package
// composes is asked to survive the round trip.
