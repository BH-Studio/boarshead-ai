// THE INK RUN OF 2026-08-29, AT THE MOMENT ITS ONE NODE STOPPED EXISTING.

// `leaf_exhausted` saying "its work is recorded and the node goes back on the
// queue" — and then, in the same second, `node_failed`. Store.Ready serves
// pending rows only, so the node never went anywhere near the queue; the
// settlement watch saw one terminal node and left with exit 1, no gate verdict,
// seventy-three minutes of unspent wall and a twenty-six kilobyte patch on disk.
//
// The law: an ending that is exhaustion is not a verdict on the work. The claim
// goes back, the node is offered again, and the next claim resumes from the
// record the last one left.
