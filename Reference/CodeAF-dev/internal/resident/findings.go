// What a job is still short of, read from its own record and handed to
// everything that works on it next.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS ANSWERS. The textual run of 2026-08-29 (s9) measured its
// coverage gap on every one of three gates and reported the same two unexercised
// behaviours each time — 2, then 2, then 2. Across those three repair rounds it
// briefed fourteen nodes, and THIRTEEN OF THE FOURTEEN BRIEFS NAME NEITHER
// BEHAVIOUR. One node, by luck of the planner's wording, mentioned one of them.
// So the run measured the same shortfall three times, spent three rounds and
// fourteen leaves on it, and never once told a worker what it was.
//
// The reason is that the findings were reaching the brief through PROSE. A
// planner is handed a goal, writes briefs in its own words, and whatever it does
// not happen to restate is gone — and a model summarising a page of instructions
// will drop a two-item list nine times in ten. The measurement was structured
// (store.DeliveryGate.Unexercised is a list, and was one deliberately), and then
// it was flattened back into a paragraph on the only path that mattered.
//
// So: THE OPEN FINDINGS ARE READ FROM THE RECORD AND WRITTEN INTO THE BRIEF
// VERBATIM, in a fixed section, by the composer rather than by a model. What a
// worker is told it is short of is not a thing another model gets to paraphrase.

// OpenFindings is everything a job's own record says is still outstanding.
//
// Every field is sourced from a journal row rather than from anybody's summary
// of one — FAILSAFE.md's second clause, applied to the job's account of itself.
// An empty value means the record does not say, never that the answer is no.

	// whose Unclosed is set.
	//
	// It is a field beside Gap and not a value in it because the two are
	// different news and a brief that ran them together would lie either way: a
	// gap is what a review found missing, this is that nobody looked, and the
