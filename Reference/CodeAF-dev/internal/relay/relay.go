// Package relay is the blind pipe between a machine that runs codeaf and a
// machine somebody is sitting at.
//
// IT EXISTS BECAUSE THE ENGINE MACHINE ONLY EVER DIALS OUT. A home server, an
// office workstation, a laptop on a café network — none of them can be reached
// from outside, and telling a person to forward a port is the onboarding cliff
// this whole lane was written to remove. So the engine machine opens ONE
// outbound connection to the relay and holds it. NAT and firewalls become
// irrelevant, because nothing was opened.
//
// THE RELAY MUST NOT BE ABLE TO READ A FRAME, AND THAT IS A PROPERTY OF THE
// CODE AND NOT A PROMISE IN A DOCUMENT. This package imports neither
// internal/remote nor internal/pair; it has no key material of the
// conversation's, no decoder for the conversation's frames, and no type in it
// that could hold a plaintext. What it moves is a byte slice it never looks
// inside. Its total knowledge of a session is the machine's NAME, the TIMING,
// and the BYTE COUNTS — and a test in this package pins exactly that
// (relay_blind_test.go).
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT is a trust root. The name a machine registers under is derived
// from that machine's own key, and the relay checks possession of that key
// before it hands the name over — but a name is a rendezvous label, never an
// identity. Everything that makes a connection safe happens ABOVE this package,
// end to end, in internal/pair: a PAKE over a code shown on the engine machine's
// own screen, and thereafter a Noise handshake between keys both ends have
// pinned. A relay that lied about which machine is which produces a failed
// handshake, not a compromise.
//
// THE CARRIER IS AN HTTP UPGRADE OVER ONE TCP CONNECTION, in front of TLS in
// production. The design doc says "outbound websocket" and means the property
// rather than the framing: one long-lived connection the engine machine dials
// out on, over the port every network already lets out. A websocket's masking
// and its close protocol buy nothing here — both ends of this pipe are codeaf,
// and the payloads are already ciphertext — while its framing would be a second
// framing on top of the one below, which this package needs anyway to carry
// several surfaces down one carrier.

// Protocol is the upgrade token both ends spell, and the door that refuses a
// build that would misread the bytes. It is bumped when the rendezvous framing
// below changes, which is a different clock from internal/remote's Version —
// the relay carries session frames it cannot read, so the two versions move
// independently and neither may be inferred from the other.
// This is an ON-THE-WIRE identifier, not product prose. A product rename may
// not split old and new relay clients into different protocols.
