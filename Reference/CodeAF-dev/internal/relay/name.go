package relay

// A MACHINE'S NAME IS DERIVED FROM ITS KEY, NEVER CHOSEN.
//
// The name is what a person types — `codeaf chat --at otter-lamp-42` — so it has
// to be sayable, typable over a phone call, and short enough to read off a
// screen. But it is also what the relay matches a dial against, so if it were
// chosen there would be a land rush for the good ones and a way to sit on
// somebody else's. Deriving it from the machine's own long-term public key
// makes the name a FACT ABOUT THE MACHINE rather than a claim it registered,
// and lets the relay refuse a registration whose name and key do not agree
// without holding an account for anybody.
//
// WHAT THE NAME IS NOT is an identity. It is 22-odd bits of a hash: two words
// out of 256 and a two-digit number. Somebody who wants a key that hashes to
// YOUR name can grind for one in seconds. That is fine, and it is fine for a
// stated reason: the name is a rendezvous label and the trust is elsewhere. A
// dial that lands on the wrong machine fails the Noise handshake in
// internal/pair, because the surface pinned the key it paired with and this
// machine does not hold it. The squatter gets a name and a refused handshake.
// See [Names] for the whole of the policy, which the relay implements and this
// file's derivation is only the first half of.

// nameSalt keeps this derivation from ever colliding with another use of the
// same key. Every hash of a device key in this tree carries the label of what
// it is being hashed FOR.

// every machine already paired through the relay.

// NameFor is the name a machine holding this public key registers under.
//
// The shape is two words and a two-digit number — `otter-lamp-42` — because
// that is a thing a person reads off one screen and types into another without
// writing it down. The number exists so that two machines whose keys collide on
// both words still differ, and so that the name never looks like an English
// phrase somebody might try to guess at.

// asking it to would be asking it to hold a directory of everybody's machines.

// Names is the name-squatting policy, written down where the code that enforces
// it can be read beside it. It is a constant so that the relay's own operator
// documentation and the manual page quote the same words rather than two
// paraphrases that drift.
//
// THE POLICY IS FOUR RULES:
//
//  1. A name must agree with the key that claims it. The relay recomputes
//     [NameFor] over the offered key and refuses a registration where the two
//     disagree, so a name cannot be claimed by a machine that does not hold a
//     key for it.
//  2. Possession is proved, not asserted. The registering machine answers a
//     challenge that can only be answered with the private half of the key it
//     offered, so a name cannot be claimed by replaying somebody's public key.
//  3. A live registration is never taken over. While a machine is connected
//     under a name, a second machine offering the same name is refused — even
//     with a valid key. Whoever is there stays there until they leave.
//  4. The name is not the trust root, and the relay says so out loud. Grinding
//     a key whose hash lands on a given name costs seconds; it buys the name
//     and nothing else, because the surface dialling it has pinned the key it
//     paired with and the handshake fails against any other.
const Names = `a name is derived from the machine's own key, proved on registration, held while that machine is connected, and never a substitute for the pinned key the two ends actually trust`

// nameWords is 256 short words with no two that sound alike over a phone. Two
// of them and two digits is a little over 22 bits, which is a rendezvous label
// and never a secret — see the header of this file.
