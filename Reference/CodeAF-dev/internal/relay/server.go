package relay

// The service. It is an [http.Handler] so that a relay operator can put it
// behind whatever already terminates TLS for them, and so that this package's
// own tests can drive it through httptest with no port and no certificate.
//
// WHAT IT HOLDS is a table of names that are connected right now, and nothing
// else. There is no account, no password, no database, no record of who dialled
// what — a registration exists while its connection does and is forgotten the
// moment that connection ends. THIS IS THE PRODUCT DECISION, not an unfinished
// one: a relay that remembered would be a relay somebody could subpoena, and
// the only thing it could ever tell them is which made-up machine names were
// online, which is exactly why it is not worth keeping.
//
// WHAT IT CAN SEE, stated so that nobody has to guess: the name, the times, and
// the byte counts. [Ledger] is that list made into a type — it is the whole of
// what this service could report about a session even if it wanted to, and a
// test asserts the payloads never appear in it.
