// The two client halves. Both dial OUT and neither listens, which is the whole
// reason this lane exists: a machine behind a router with no forwarded port and
// a laptop on a café network can reach each other because they both walked out
// to the same door.
//
// THE ERRORS HERE ARE SENTINELS AND NOT SENTENCES. This package knows that
// nothing is connected under a name; it does not know that the person typed
// `--at otter-lamp-42` and needs to be told which of four different things went
// wrong in one line. internal/pair does that, because it is the layer that
// knows whether this device is even paired with that machine. What crosses the
// boundary is [ErrNoMachine], [ErrUnreachable], [ErrNameTaken] and
// [ErrTooMany] — facts, which the door above turns into the person's sentence.
