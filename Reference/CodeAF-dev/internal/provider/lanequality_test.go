//
// The belief has carried a quality axis since the routing wave landed — a Beta
// posterior, decayed toward the lane's prior over QualityHalfLife, read by the
// frontier gate against the role's own QualityNeed — and until this wave NOTHING
// IN THE SHIPPED PATH EVER WROTE TO IT. Ledger.NoteOutcome had one caller in the
// whole tree and it was a simulator.
//
// So the measured failure of 2026-08-31 was not a missing mechanism. An endpoint
// served a reply that had stopped being language, the stream was cut for it, the
// old strike ledger refused the lane for five minutes — and the belief, which is
// what the chooser actually ranks on, learned nothing at all. These pin the two
// wires that were missing.

// qualityClient builds a client that talks to `base` as though it were the
// router, with a recording ledger under it. The model id carries the router's
// prefix, which is what makes the attribution seams fire.
