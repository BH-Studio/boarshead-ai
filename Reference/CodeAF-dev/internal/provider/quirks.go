// Quirks are the request-shape facts a provider will not publish and only a
// call's answer can teach.
//
// The first of them is the reason this file exists:
// an endpoint that refuses to have its reasoning turned off. OpenRouter's
// listing says which knobs a model ACCEPTS — that is the catalog's
// supported_parameters, and it is enough to keep the harness from sending a
// reasoning field to a model that takes none. It does not say whether the
// disable inside that field is honoured, and on MiniMax M2.7 it is not: the
// model always thinks, and answers {"reasoning":{"enabled":false}} with a 400.
//
// Nothing here is a list of model names. A name in the source would be a
// second, private catalog that goes stale the week a provider changes its mind,
// and the whole point of the memo is that the endpoint itself is the authority.
// The adapter learns the fact the one way it can be learned — by being told no
// — repairs the call it was making, and writes it down so that the next process
// does not have to be told again.
//
// The file is a cache and never a source of truth. A missing, unreadable or
// nonsense file costs one discovery per model per process, which is exactly
// what the state was before it existed.

const quirksFile = "model-quirks.json"

	// It is separate because a silent ignore and a rejected request are
	// different wire facts even though both mean a caller must leave room.
	disableIgnored map[string]time.Time
	// noCacheControl is the second learned set: models whose endpoint rejected
	// an ephemeral cache breakpoint. It is a separate map rather than a flag on
	// one record because the two facts are independent — a model may reason
	// unconditionally and take breakpoints, or neither, or both.
	noCacheControl map[string]time.Time
	// noReasoningBudget is the third learned set: models whose endpoint rejected
	// the thinking budget the ladder's top two rungs carry (wire.go's
	// refusesReasoningBudget). Independent of both maps above for the same
	// reason they are independent of each other — an endpoint may take the
	// effort word and refuse the budget, or the other way round.

	// survives the process, which is the whole difference between a harness
	// that learns and one that rediscovers. The lane is part of the key for the
	// reason the router's call classes are per class: a model that cuts on a

// needed a seam in non-test code at all: the store is not a plain value a test
// helper can reassign over, because a fresh one would leave the old one's
// scheduled save still holding a file descriptor into a profile directory its
// test is about to remove. What bit was
// TestARepairedRefusalLeavesTheRefusedShapeAndThenTheAnswer, which asserts on a
// refusal AND its repair: the first run of it in a process learned that the
// model refuses a disabled reasoning field, the second run already knew and sent
// the repaired shape first, and there was no refusal left to see (#455).
//
// NOTHING ON A PRODUCTION PATH MAY CALL IT. The memo's whole value is that a
// fact learned by being told no survives the call, the process and — through the
// file — the machine; a production caller that forgot it would buy back the
// rejected call it was written to spend once. Its callers are the rig's
// resetSharedLearners and nothing else, which is what the name is for.
//
// THE FORGETTING COMES FIRST AND THE WAIT COMES AFTER IT, which is the opposite
// of the obvious order and the only one that is sound. [persist] takes
// writes.Add(1) with the mutex ALREADY RELEASED — every caller of it does, from
// [record] returning to [NoteAnswerCut] unlocking a line before it — so a reset
// that waited first would return from Wait, drop the lock, and be racing an
// Add against the very WaitGroup it had just waited on, which is misuse and not
// merely untidy. Waiting under the lock is not the fix either: [snapshot] takes
// the same mutex, so that deadlocks.
//
// Emptying first disarms instead of racing. A save already scheduled reads the
// path under the lock in [snapshot], finds it empty, and writes nothing; a save
// scheduled a moment later does the same. So by the time settle waits, every
// writer that can still exist is one that will put nothing on a disk, and the
// wait is only there to see them off the profile directory before the test
// removes it. That is also why the maps cannot be left for after the wait: a
// save that ran between the two would put a half-forgotten memo on the disk
// under the name of a whole one.
//
// THE CONTRACT THAT REMAINS is the rig's. This is called from a cleanup, after
// the test's clients have stopped learning; a client still recording into the
// memo while the reset runs would be a test that outlived its own goroutines,
// and that leak is the test's to fix rather than something this seam can
// paper over.
//
// THE FILE IS LEFT ALONE, and forgetting the path is what makes that safe. The
// path is set by [load] and nowhere else, so a store with no path can neither
// save nor be re-read: the next process to learn this memo back is one that
// pointed [LoadQuirks] at that directory on purpose, which is a test asserting
// that a memo on disk is believed at startup rather than a fact leaking sideways.
// Deleting the file instead would break exactly those tests and would have this
// reset reaching outside the process it is resetting.
//
// The loaded flag goes back to false as bookkeeping. Nothing reads it today —
