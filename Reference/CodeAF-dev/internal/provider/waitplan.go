// ── WHAT ONE CALL IS WATCHED WITH ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A plan is not a decision. It is what is BELIEVED about the machine expected
// to serve, what the role will wait, where acting could go and what this call may
// spend rescuing itself — assembled here because this is the only place all four are known
// at once, and handed to `internal/lane/control`, which is the only thing in
// this build that decides when a wait has gone on long enough.

// ── THE PURSE IS THE CALL'S OWN, AND THE PROCESS HAS NONE ───────────────────
//
// There was a package-wide budget here until 2026-09-11 — two rescues in any
// twenty requests and a tenth of the last hour's bill, shared by every client —
// and it is deleted. A window cannot tell the request that needs a rescue from
// the nineteen that do not, so it refused by arrival order and overruled the one
// thing in this build that decides when a wait has gone on long enough
// ([internal/lane]'s hedge.go carries the measurement). What a call may spend
// rescuing itself is its own patience converted through λ
// ([control.Plan.SpendUSD]), and it is built with the rest of the plan.

// ── WHAT ONE CALL IS WATCHED WITH ───────────────────────────────────────────

// planFor is everything the controller is built with, for THIS call.
//
// It is assembled here because this is the only place all of it is known at
// once: the role, from the context; the belief, from the ledger; the lanes
// worth going to, from the choice; and what it may spend rescuing itself, from
// the plan the role already carries. None of it is a decision — the plan says
// what is believed and what is allowed, and `internal/lane/control` is the only
// thing that decides.

	// THE PLAN IS `internal/lane`'s ARITHMETIC AND IT IS BUILT THERE: the head

	// it is the only one to know.

	// A PIN IS WHAT THE CHOICE SAYS IT IS, AND NEVER THE LENGTH OF `Only`: the

	// (offer.go). This line counted `Only` until 2026-09-11, which was the same
	// sentence for exactly as long as a demand and a pin were the same field.
	// Once the chooser began demanding the set it admitted ([lane.demandOf]),
	// counting would have called ordinary traffic pinned — the hazard's `Ask`
	// road instead of a hedge, `switch to auto?` about a machine nobody chose,
	// and no rescue sent at all. A pin is a person's word and a demand is our
	// own admitted set; [lane.Choice.Pinned] carries the first and `Only` the
	// second. How long the answer will be is the caller's own hint, and it is
	// what makes the commitment half of the inequality computable. And how long
	// this model deliberates is a fact about the model and the rung it was asked
	// at, which is a knob only this layer resolves. THE PURSE IS NOT AMONG THEM
	// ANY MORE: it is the plan's own budget and `lane.PlanFor` fills it in,
	// which is why nothing here names money.

	// when there is nowhere better to go, and the ceiling still applies.
	// A DECISION SITE (#433). An alternative is a machine a SECOND REQUEST
	// would demand with `provider.only`, so "could not be demanded" is the
	// base's own answer about carrying a preference and not its hostname.
	//
	// AND UNDER `simple` WITH NO PIN THERE IS NOWHERE TO GO EITHER. The row's
	// whole promise is that nothing on this side names a machine, and a rescue
	// is exactly that — a second request demanding a lane this process chose
	// off the sheet, sent while the first is still streaming. So the frontier
	// is empty and a stall is reported rather than rescued. With a pin the
	// alternatives stay, because there the act is the offer — `switch to
	// auto?` — and a question has to name where a `y` would go (offer.go).
