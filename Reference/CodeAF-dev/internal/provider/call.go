// adapter can act on it. The classes are the harness's own passes rather than
// anything generic, because that is the grain ability actually varies at — the
// router lab found the panel's ordering on structured planning different from
// its ordering on reasoning, and averaging them would have hidden both.

// function that opened them. The router writes down which model it picked, so
// that the second turn of a leaf goes where the first one went — a leaf that
// wandered between models would rewrite its prefix cache every turn and mix two
// lineages into one transcript. And the call site writes down how the work
// turned out, which it can only know after it has parsed and checked the answer,
// long after the call itself returned.
//
// A call made without a slot is not an error and not a special case: the slot is
// absent on every path that has no router, and every method here is a no-op then.
