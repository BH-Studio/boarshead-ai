// ── A MODEL THAT TAKES NO TOOLS IS NOT SENT ANY ─────────────────────────────
//
// The catalog publishes which request fields a model accepts, and a row that
// lists its parameters without "tools" has said the model takes no tool calls.
// Sending the belt anyway bought, on every turn of a 2026-09-28 conversation
// with microsoft/phi-4: a refused first attempt, a `Retry 1/1: removed tools`
// line nobody could read the reason in, and a request-size check that counted
// ~9k tokens of definitions the model was never going to receive — so the
// conversation was refused as too long at 15.6k when the request that would
// have gone out was 6k, and summarized to make room it already had.
//
// So the definitions are left off before the body is encoded, the size check
// measures what is really sent, and the person is told once, in words about
// what the model can do rather than about request fields. A row that lists no
// parameters has said nothing, and the tools go out as before: the refusal
// ladder is still there for a model the catalog does not know.

// toollessMemo is which models this client has already said it is sending no
// tools to, so the notice is said once per model rather than on every turn —
// and which models the catalog could not describe but no provider would serve
// with tools, so the refusal is paid once per model rather than every turn.
//
// THE LEARNED HALF LAPSES AFTER A SERVING HOLD. It is not written to the
// quirks file: a provider that starts serving tools again gets another chance
// during a long-running client as well as after a restart.
