// ── THE ROW IS HONEST ABOUT WHO ANSWERED, WHAT IT COST AND WHAT IT ASKED FOR ─
//
// The census over ten days of this build's own log (docs/design/recovery/
// census-20260910.md) found three things wrong with the record itself, and each
// of them made a later wave's number unmeasurable:
//
//   - `served` was empty on every row that never opened a stream, and every
//     per-lane belief was therefore keyed on `lane` — the machine ASKED FOR,
//     which on 3,728 of 10,107 finishes was not the machine that answered;
//   - a failed attempt recorded no cost and no tokens, so $201 of spend had
//     $0.00 attributed to anything that went wrong;
//   - `retry_after` was never present on any of 1,106 paced refusals, so no
//     repeated send could be checked against what the provider had asked for.
//
// These are staged against the real router stub rather than asserted on a
// hand-built record, because each of them is about a fact that only exists
// while a request is on a wire.

// TestTheRowNamesTheMachineThatAnsweredAndNotTheOneAskedFor stages the
// commonest disagreement in the live log: the preference ranks a full pool
// first, the router quietly serves the next machine, and the row has to say
// both.

// TestEveryStartRowGetsARowUnderIt is the law, and it is asserted over the

// Over the ten days to 2026-09-10, 527 of 16,921 attempts had a start row and
// nothing beside it — which every reader of this file, a person and the census
// alike, reads as a call that is still in flight. Six of them were one turn on
// a model the catalog holds no endpoints for, where the ladder ran out and
// returned without writing anything. Five separate comments in this package
// state the law; a law kept by every path remembering to keep it has one
// counter-example per exit, so the transport now closes what it opened
// (calllog.go's [callTrace.open]).
//
// IT IS A LAW ABOUT THE SETTLED LOG AND NOT ABOUT ONE INSTANT. A race the caller
// abandoned answers that caller at once and keeps its account behind them
// ([hedgeRace.accountForTheAbandoned]), so for a few milliseconds after a
// cancelled call returns there really is a start row with nothing under it. That
// is the trade and it is deliberate: the caller of a cancelled race is a person
// who has just typed a correction, and the drain used to cost them the whole of
// [lane.SpokenWithin]. So the tally is taken once the arms have reported —
// bounded by [abandonGrace], which is what bounds the accounting itself — and
// every other clause of the law is unchanged and asserted exactly as it was.
