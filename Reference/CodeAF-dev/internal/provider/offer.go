// ── A PIN IS ASKED, NEVER OVERRIDDEN ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The controller's arithmetic is the same for a pinned lane as for any other:
// the wait has gone on longer than acting would cost, and there is somewhere
// better to be. What changes is the ACT. A person who named a machine said
// something, and a build that quietly went somewhere else the first time that
// machine was slow would be answering a question nobody asked — while a build
// that waited forever on it would be the defect this whole design exists to
// remove. So the wait is turned into one sentence:
//
//	coreweave is slow · switch to auto? (y)
//
// FOUR RULES AND NO MORE.
//
//  1. IT IS RAISED ONCE per request. A second offer for one answer is nagging.
//  2. `y` FIRES THE RESCUE AT ONCE, to the lane the frontier already named.
//     There is no second choice made at the worst possible moment.
//  3. ANY VISIBLE TOKEN WITHDRAWS IT. The pin came good and the question is
//     moot. A thinking delta does not: nothing has arrived that a person can
//     read.
//  4. THE PIN ITSELF IS UNTOUCHED. Accepting is for THIS answer; the next
//     request goes to the pinned machine, because that is what a pin means.
//
// AND WITH NOBODY TO ASK, THE ANSWER IS STILL DELIVERED. A headless run — no
// phase reader registered, which is the same seam the surface uses — borrows at
// the ceiling, once, and says so on the row. A pin is a person's instruction,
// and an instruction whose author cannot be reached at the moment it becomes
// expensive is honoured by getting them their answer and writing down what was
// done. The alternative is a run that waits forever on a machine that has gone
// quiet, with nobody watching to notice.

// offerWindow is how long an open offer stands before it is dropped.
//
// It is [PhaseWindow] and not a figure of its own: the offer rides one phase
// post, a surface stops drawing a phase it has not heard about for that long,
// and an offer that outlived the sentence describing it would be a keystroke
// landing on a question the person can no longer see.
