// The server: one per run of a program, on this machine's loopback, opened by
// one token, closed when the run ends.
//
// ── EVERY CALL IS A TURN OF A CONVERSATION A PERSON CAN READ ────────────────
//
// To the program this is a model backend like any other. To codeaf the program
// is a very particular person asking it things, so every call is written down
// as one turn of that conversation (delegate.Turn, in the task's own record
// folder): once when it starts, so the task page can show a call in flight, and
// once when it ends, under the same number.
//
// ── MONEY IS METERED HERE, CALL BY CALL, AND NOWHERE ELSE ───────────────────
//
// The funnel tells whoever armed the call what each answer cost the moment it
// decodes it (provider.WithBilling), and a receipt fetched later for a stream
// that was cut before its usage block (provider.WithReconcile). Both reach the
// run through [Config.Bank] as they happen, so the run's ceiling, the task's
// spend rows and the machine's spending ledger all see a call's dollars before
// the program does. The program's own account of what it spent is never read.
//
// ── THE RUN'S BOOKS CLOSE ONLY WHEN ITS RECEIPTS ARE IN ─────────────────────
//
// A call cut in the middle — the one in flight when a person stops the run, or
// when the supervisor ends it at the ceiling — is still paid for, and its price
// arrives by the provider's receipt about twenty seconds later. [Server.Close]
// waits for every receipt still owed on this run's calls (bounded by
// provider.ReceiptWait) before it returns, so the run's total read after it,
// the task's spend rows and the conversation's books all hold that money.
//
// ── THE CEILING IS A REFUSAL BEFORE THE CALL ────────────────────────────────
//
// Each call reserves its estimated cost before it goes out; a call that would
// cross the ceiling is answered 402 in the router's own shape and written as a
// refused turn. An answer may cost more than its estimate. The run's supervisor
// ends a program that has spent its allowance.
