// What the program said that it had not said before.
//
// A program talks to its model the way every chat client does: each request
// carries the whole conversation so far. Written down whole, one call's record
// would repeat every call before it, and the task page would draw the same
// brief forty times. So each thread's previous request is remembered — as one
// fingerprint per message, never the text — and a turn records only what came
// after it: the brief the first time, then the tools' results and the
// program's own words.
//
// A PROGRAM THAT REWRITES ITS HISTORY IS SAID TO HAVE DONE SO. When a request
// is not the previous one with more added — a compaction, a summary of old
// turns in place of the turns — nothing is a delta of anything, so the turn is
// marked Restarted and records what the program sent, whole (capped where the
// log is written, delegate.AppendTurn).
//
// THE MODEL'S OWN REPLIES ARE NOT SENT WORDS. An assistant message on a request
// is the program handing the model's last answer back to it; the page already
// drew that answer on the turn that produced it, so it is skipped here.
