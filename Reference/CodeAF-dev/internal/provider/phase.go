// ── THE PHASE CLOCK: WHAT THIS REQUEST IS DOING, AND WHAT HAPPENS NEXT ──────
//
// THE DEFECT THIS FIXES, in the words it was reported in: "stuck in a state
// where in the middle of thinking it just says still working, but at the bottom
// I see glm 5.3 friendli and t/s — not sure if we are not accounting for all
// places things could slow, and also no timer indicator like 'hey, if this does
// not work I am changing provider in …'".
//
// Both halves of that are true and they are the same omission. A request has at
// least nine states in which it can be slow — a handshake, a queue before the
// first word, a run of thought, an answer arriving in lumps, a rate-limit wait,
// a relaxed re-ask, a rescue in flight, a tool running, a compaction — and
// until this file the surface could see exactly one bit of any of them: whether
// a delta had arrived in the last ten seconds. Everything else it drew was
// INFERRED, which is why the line under a stalled thinking pass said "still
// working" and the status row went on quoting the previous answer's lane and
// rate as though they were happening now.
//
// So the layer that knows says so. A phase is pushed the moment it changes and
// again while it lasts, and it carries four things and no more:
//
//	Phase     what is happening, in a person's word
//	Since     when this phase began — the surface counts up from it, at paint
//	Deadline  when something will be DONE about it, and zero when nothing will
//	Then      what that something is ("parasail"), empty when there is nothing
//
// A DEADLINE IS NEVER INVENTED. The countdown a person reads is the watch's own
// hedge deadline or the pacing wait the router asked for — a real moment at
// which this build really acts. Where no alternative lane exists, or the guard
// is off, or routing is off, the phase and its clock are still true and the
// consequence is simply absent. A fake countdown that expires and does nothing
// is worse than no countdown: it is the surface lying about the machinery, and
// the emptiness law already says what to draw instead, which is nothing.
//
// THE ARROW POINTS ONE WAY, as it does for the lane news it sits beside
// (internal/session's lanenews.go): internal/session imports this package, so
// this package pushes and a reader registers. A build with nobody listening
// pays one atomic load per phase change.

// Phase is what a request is doing right now.
//
// THE WORDS ARE THE PERSON'S. There is no `awaiting_first_token`, no `hedging`,
// no `backoff` — a surface that has to translate a machine word is a surface
// that will translate it differently from the next one (the design law about
// machinery vocabulary). What is spelled here is what is read out loud.
