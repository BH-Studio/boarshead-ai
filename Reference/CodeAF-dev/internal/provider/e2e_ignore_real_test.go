// ── THE SELF-INFLICTED REFUSAL, AGAINST THE REAL ROUTER ─────────────────────
//
// selfemptied_test.go proves the law against a router-shaped fake whose serving
// set is a constant somebody typed. That is the right instrument for the rule
// and the wrong one for the claim it was written for, which is about the world:
// the canary's rows came from a real model with a real number of machines
// behind it, and the whole question is whether this process's own list can
// cover that number.
//
// So this file THINS A REAL SERVING SET. Round after round it strikes every
// machine it has seen answer, until the vetoes it sends cover everything the
// router will offer. Before the law, every request from that point on is
// refused before any endpoint is asked; after it, the router's sentence is
// heard once and the requests land.
//
// ── WHAT IT MEASURED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// 2026-09-03, deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash, 22 rounds, sixteen machines:
//
//	dev 713945e3b   36 HTTP calls   8 refusal rows (one per request from round 15)   1m09.8s
//	with the law    23 HTTP calls   1 refusal row  (the one that teaches)            31.5s
//
// The thirteen calls that disappear are the ladder's wasted round trips.
//
// ── WHAT IT COSTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every call asks for one word under a small max_tokens, and the run prints the
// cost the router billed. On the model it is written against the whole run is a
// fraction of a cent. Nothing here retries and nothing here loops.
//
// ── HOW TO RUN IT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//	go test -tags e2e ./internal/provider/ -run TestRealRouter -v
//
// It skips, green and loudly, with no key. The key is resolved exactly as a
// session resolves it (internal/config's APIKeyAt): the OpenRouter variable,
// then the OpenAI one, then the profile file.
//
// IN PRACTICE THAT MEANS THE VARIABLE. This package's TestMain re-roots
// CODEAF_HOME to a throwaway directory before any test runs (calllog_test.go),
// so the profile rung resolves under that root and finds nothing — which is the
// right behaviour for every other test here and the reason the skip sentence
// names the variable first. Export it from the profile if that is where the key
// lives.
