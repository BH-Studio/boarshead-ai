// ── WHO SERVED, AND HOW FAST ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A router fans one model over many endpoints. Two of them are a datacentre
// away with a warm replica; one is a machine somebody is also training on, and
// it answers the same request at a fifth of the speed. The model id says
// nothing about which one a request landed on, so a session that only names its
// model is describing a decision it did not make.
//
// AND THEY DO NOT CHARGE THE SAME. That was assumed here for a long time and it
// is simply false: an endpoint's tariff is its own, and the model id's published
// list price is a figure none of them is obliged to match. Asking for the
// fastest one and saying nothing about price is how a cost autopsy over 44
// bench cells found this surface paying ~3.5× list at identical token counts —
// see latencyPriceCeiling, which is the whole of the answer.
//
// This file is the half of the adapter that both ASKS for speed and CHECKS it.
// Asking is one object on the wire — the routing preferences below. Checking is
// the ledger: every completion is timed, the response says who served it, and
// an endpoint that keeps being slow is demoted and then, for a while, refused.
//
// Nothing here knows a vendor's name. The law reads only "who served, and how
// fast", and every name in it arrived from the wire a moment ago.

// RoutingStrategy is how a session asks the router to choose among the
// endpoints serving one model.
//
// It is a CHOICE and not a bool because the two live answers are not opposites:
// latency wants the fastest endpoint, price wants the cheapest, and they
// routinely disagree. Off is the third answer and it is a real one — it sends
// no preference object at all, which is what an operator behind a gateway that
// does not speak this dialect needs.

// [RoutingSource] is how a caller HANDS an answer down, and every client that
// is handed one keeps it. The problem is the clients nobody hands one to, and
// there are several: the harness and the subharness build their own adapters
// (cmd/codeaf), `read_document` and `view_image` build theirs
// (internal/config), and a panel builds one per member (internal/router). Each
// of those was assembled through [config.Config.ClientConfig], which has never
// carried a routing answer at all — so whatever a person wrote in the routing
// row, those adapters ran on the default.
//
// THAT IS A BREACH OF THE ROW, AND IT WAS A SILENT ONE. Those adapters ran the
// ranked road while the default was `latency`, and the ranked road may retire A
// PERSON'S PIN before any wire is asked — a machine the saved account exclusions
// cover is stood down where it is drawn (lanes.go). The retirement is
// process-wide, so the conversation's own next turn — running `simple`, doing
// everything right — found the pin already retired and went out bare, with the
// sentence parked on a call nobody was reading and the chrome still naming the
// machine. The default has moved since ([DefaultRouting]) and the breach has
// not: a person who writes `latency` or `price` is owed it in every adapter
// this process builds, exactly as one who leaves the row alone is.
//
// So the row is installed ONCE, by the same door that installs the lane rows a
// person wrote (internal/config's InstallLaneRows), and every client that was
// handed nothing reads it. It is a process-wide knob for [lanePin]'s reason
// said again: the row is about a SESSION and not about an adapter, and two
// clients in one process holding two answers to "what did they ask for" is the
// defect above. A HANDED-DOWN ANSWER STILL WINS — the engine host and a task
// child carry their parent's row explicitly, and a process-wide fallback may
// not overrule a caller that spoke.

// machine — a person's strict pin, or the machine a rescue's arm exists to try —
// is left exactly as it stands, whatever has refused it: there is no other
// machine for the next body to go to, so the one legal same-machine repeat is
// [control.Next]'s to authorize and the ladder's first rung is what takes the
// field off. That question is [demandedLane]'s and it is asked of it here rather
// than answered again: it is the same door the veto law's exemption reads and
// the same reading [requestSet] confines the plan to, so the set this narrows,
// the set the plan walks and the machine the law exempts cannot disagree.
//
// A DEMAND THE BELIEF MADE IS OURS, AND IT EMPTIES. It is the admitted set
// (internal/lane's demandOf), so a machine in it that has refused this call is a
// machine this build no longer wants — struck, like the ranking — and when every
// name has gone the demand goes with it. Keeping the last one is what asked a
// pool of two, with one refusing, to serve the request from the refuser while
// `allow_fallbacks: false` forbade the router the healthy machine it would
// otherwise have found. With the demand gone the router has its whole roster
// back for the one body that needs it, and the CALL still walks the set it
// decided on, because the plan reads the choice rather than this object
// ([requestSet]) and [control.Next] never returns a machine already tried.
//
// A CALL THAT HAS BEEN REFUSED BY NOBODY CHANGES NOTHING, which is every call
// on every healthy path: the object is returned untouched and the request is
// byte-for-byte the request it has always been.
//
// AND IT WILL BUILD AN OBJECT WHERE THERE WAS NONE, because a base that carries
// preferences and has had a machine refuse it has something to ask with even
// when nothing else about the request wanted a preference — the veto itself.

//
// IT IS ONE RULE OVER TWO DENOMINATORS, and naming them is the whole of it.
// WITH A DEMAND, the set is exactly what `only` names: `allow_fallbacks: false`
// forbids every other machine, so vetoes covering those names leave the router
// nothing, and it says so before asking any endpoint. WITHOUT ONE, the set is
// the router's whole roster, of which this process knows only the lanes it has
// timed. Either way the question is the same — is anything in the set still
// servable — and so is the answer when nothing is: the lane whose cooldown
// expires soonest is released. It is the one the ledger was about to forgive
// anyway, so it is the smallest departure from the ledger's own verdict, and
// every lane it is still surer about stays refused. A COVERED SET RELEASES ONE
// LANE AND NEVER THE LIST: a demand naming two machines with one of them vetoed
// is already servable through the other, and nothing is owed to the first.
//
// THE SECOND DENOMINATOR WAITS FOR EVIDENCE AND MAY NOT COUNT INSTEAD, which is

// machines serve a model, so "the vetoes cover everything I know" is routinely

// seen. Releasing on that arithmetic would send every request straight back to
// the machine that had just refused it, which is the measured failure a whole
// rule in [velocityLedger.preferences] exists to prevent. So it turns on
// [velocityLedger.coveringIgnoreRefused]: the router is the only authority on
// the size of the set, it says so in a sentence, and it is asked once per model.
// Once it has, [velocityLedger.reachableLanes] subtracts the machines that same
// refusal proved the router would not have sent to. The learning
// spares every lane on the transmitted ignore list,
// so every subtraction is sound even though this process cannot read the
// account's own exclusions. A demand needs neither evidence nor subtraction,

//
// ── THE MEASURED FAILURE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// SWE-Marathon run s2 died on `after 3 retries: API error (400): Provider
// returned error`. Three retries, and nothing between them moved: releasing the
// pin (affinity.go) only stops this process ASKING for that endpoint — it does
// not stop the router choosing it again, and a router with a warm pool chooses
// the same member every time. The three attempts were three deliveries of the
// same request to the same upstream, and the turn ended with five hours of the
// ask unspent.
//
// THE LAW: AN UPSTREAM THAT REFUSED IS ROUTED AROUND, NOT ASKED AGAIN. It is
// the same verdict a 429 that names its pool earns and the same one a cut stream
// earns — a lane this process has decided not to send to — and it travels the
// same way, in `provider.ignore` on every request encoded after it.
//
// IT STRIKES A LANE OR IT STRIKES NOTHING, and which of the two is not this
// function's to decide: it is reader (a) of the one refusal object
// (refusalobject.go), and every question about what a refusal MEANS is answered
// there. A 4xx over our own bytes that demanded no machine names no lane and
// strikes nothing — there is no endpoint to blame for a malformed request, and
// refusing endpoints over our own bytes would empty the ledger one attempt at a
// time. A 429 is paced rather than struck, for the wait it named
// ([Client.refuseLane]).
//
// `served` is the machine this process knows was answering, empty when it knows
// of none, and `wait` is the comeback the provider asked for, zero when it
// asked for none.
// It is carried on this signature rather than looked up because only the caller
// holding the response can read a `Retry-After` header, and a 429 that reaches
// the ledger without its named wait is held for the flat cooldown instead of
// the minute the pool actually asked for.
//
// ── AND THE ROUTER'S OWN REFUSAL IS NO LONGER EXEMPT ────────────────────────
//
// It used to require `provider_name` in the error metadata, which OpenRouter
// puts there exactly when it is relaying somebody ELSE'S refusal — so the one
// refusal that is certain about a lane, the router's own
// `…your request's provider.only preference permits only: coreweave`, was
// structurally unable to strike the lane it named. It carried no
// `provider_name` because the router was answering for itself, so the strike
// declined it, and the same machine was chosen three more times in one run
// (issue #266). The lane a refusal is about now comes from OUR OWN REQUEST, and
// a router refusal against a demanded machine is terminal for that pairing: it
// is both paced here and written out of the serving set, because a pin the
// frontier can still choose is a pin that comes back on the next turn.
//
// IT HANDS THE CLASSIFICATION BACK, and that is the whole reason it returns an
// object rather than the bool it used to. The retry loop has a second question
// about the same refusal — which machine must be off the NEXT body (retry.go's
// [refusedHere]) — and asking the classifier again from there would be the
// classification happening twice, which is the defect refusalobject.go closed.
// Whether anything was written is still readable, as [laneRefusal.struck].

//
// ── THE MEASURED FAILURE (2026-09-10) ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// A chat turn on deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash died after four transport
// attempts: one 502 from DeepInfra, and then three 429s served by Io Net at
// 13:00:39, 13:01:04 and 13:01:32. All three arrived INSIDE an already-open
// HTTP 200 — the journal's rows say status 200 and
// `API error (429): Provider returned error (via Io Net)` — and the pacing note
// lived on the status path alone, where it was reached by reading
// `response.StatusCode` (retry.go). A 429 delivered inside a 200 never got
// there, so it reached NO ledger at all: nothing was written, the next encode
// carried the same preferences, and the router handed the request straight back
// to the saturated pool three times in ninety-three seconds.
//
// THE LAW: A REFUSAL IS ACTED ON FROM WHAT IT SAYS, NEVER FROM WHERE IT WAS
// READ. Both transports build the same [APIError] by the same function
// ([streamRefusal] → [apiError]) and both classify it with the same object
// (refusalobject.go), so both reach this door with the same value and cannot
// drift apart again. The door then does one of exactly three things:
//
//	a paced lane   held for the wait it named ([Client.notePacedProvider])
//	a struck lane  written out of the serving set and routed around
//	nothing        an account-wide limit, or our own bytes being wrong
//
// IT IS ALSO AN ENTRANCE FOR A CALLER THAT HAS ALREADY CLASSIFIED, for
// [Client.laneRefusalFor]'s reason exactly: the fork every routing refusal
// passes through (client.go's [Client.sendRecovered]) holds the object already,
// and asking the classifier a second time from there would be the
// classification happening twice — which is the whole defect refusalobject.go
// closed. [Client.refuseUpstream] is this function with the classification in
// front of it.
//
// STRIKING TWICE IS HARMLESS AND IS RELIED ON. A refusal that reaches a caller
// as a 4xx is struck at this seam and struck again by whoever reads the status;
// both halves are writes of a state rather than counters ([lane.RefuseServing]
// files a moment, [velocityLedger.pace] sets strikes rather than incrementing
// them), so the second is the first said again.
//
// ── AND IT IS NO LONGER SWITCHED OFF BY CONFIGURATION ───────────────────────
//
// Three gates used to stand at the top of this door and its two paces:
// `c.velocity == nil || !c.carriesPreferences() || c.routing() == RoutingOff`.

// NOTHING was paced, struck or learned — while every other controller on the

// no ledger. Nothing reaches the wire that was not already allowed to:

// does not carry a preference, and [Client.drawLaneChoice] answers no choice for
// the first — so the reading is kept and the steering is not. What it buys is
// that a refusal is still a fact anybody can act on: the retry loop's own
// exclusions, the stream cut's [StreamCut.Rerouted], the wall, the frontier.
