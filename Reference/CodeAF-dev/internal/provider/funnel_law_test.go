// ── THE FUNNEL LAWS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Everything this build asks a model for goes through ONE funnel, and these
// four tests are what makes that sentence true rather than aspirational.
//
// The argument is the same one the lane registry and the response boundary are
// written to (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md Decisions 8 and 10), said about the wire. A
// second path to a chat endpoint is not merely duplicated code: it is a call
// that no lane choice steers, no watch measures, no sighting teaches, no role
// prices, no phase clock narrates and no call log records. It works perfectly
// on the day it is written and it is invisible for the rest of its life — and
// the surface then reports the machinery it CAN see as though it were the whole
// story, which is the defect the phase clock exists for (phase.go).
//
// So the four laws are:
//
//	(a) nothing outside this package talks to a completions or media endpoint
//	(b) exactly six functions in this package put a request on the wire, and
//	    exactly four read an event stream
//	(c) every role in the table has a call site that names it
//	(d) only the ladder's last rung changes the model a person asked for
//
// They are structural tests in this repo's convention — the sources are read
// with go/ast and held to a law rather than to a behaviour, as
// `internal/lane/structure_test.go` and this package's own lane_law_test.go do
// — and each failure names a file and a line.
