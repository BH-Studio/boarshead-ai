// THE CALL NOBODY IS WATCHING IS THE ONE THAT HUNG.
//
// Every test beside this one attaches a stream observer, which is what an
// interactive surface does — and until 2026-08 attaching one was also what
// decided whether the request was streamed at all. A headless `codeaf do` leaf
// attaches none, so its calls took the request/response path, whose only bound
// is adaptiveCompletionTimeout's fifteen-minute ceiling. Measured, on the
// happy-dom run of 2026-08-28: three provider calls that produced nothing, each
// held for 15m24s, each followed by a twenty-minute claim reaper taking the node
// away and starting it over. Ninety minutes, $0.63, no product.
//
// The detectors were all present and all dormant. These tests pin that they are
// armed by the CALL and not by an audience.

// completeUnwatched makes one completion with NO observer on the context — the
// headless shape — against a scripted endpoint.
