// ── THE DURATION CLOCK, ON THE WIRE, ONCE THE MODEL HAS BEEN WATCHED ────────
//
// §B's second test asks whether a wait is past the (1 − p) quantile of the
// survival its clock reads, and for the duration clock that survival is
// [lanes.Thinks]. Nobody publishes how much one run of thought varies, so the
// spread stood on [lanes.SpreadFloor] for ever and the quantile sat at fifteen
// times the believed median — past every role's ceiling, at any amount of
// evidence. The gate could not close and the ceiling was the only thing that
// ever ended a hung thought (#316).
//
// IT IS OBSERVED WHERE IT IS NOT PUBLISHED, and these two are the wire's own
// account of what that buys and of what it must not cost. The first is the
// defect: a model this process has watched deliberate forty times goes quiet
// mid-thought, and the duration clock — not the ceiling — is what ends it. The
// second is the price nobody may pay for the first: the SAME belief, a thought
// that runs half again past its own quantile and is still writing, and nothing
// acts on it at all.
//
// THE LEDGER HERE IS THE REAL ONE, which is the whole point. `lanes.Thinks`
// reads the four-level hierarchy through [lanes.Hierarchy], the scripted ledger
// the rest of this file's scenarios use is not one, and a rig that scripted the
// think belief would be proving the arithmetic against a fixture rather than
// against the door `lanes.NoteThought` really writes through.
