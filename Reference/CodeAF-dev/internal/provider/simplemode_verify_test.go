// wire carries the person's own instruction and nothing else, and the danger in
// that promise is the silent half: a demand that never goes out leaves the
// chrome saying `@deepseek` over a request the router answered from wherever it
// liked, which is the exact complaint the mode was written to close.
//
// So the pin is SENT, once, even when this process already believes the
// account's own settings exclude the machine — the wire is the only authority
// on that, the belief is a day old by design (internal/lane's account.go), and
// one refused round trip a run is a smaller price than a promise quietly
// broken. When the refusal comes back the pin is retired through the SAME door
// every other mode retires one through, so the person reads the one sentence
// this build has for it and the chrome stops naming the machine in the same
