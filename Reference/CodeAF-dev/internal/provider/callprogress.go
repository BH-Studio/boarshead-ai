// CallProgress is ONE OUTBOUND CALL WATCHED WHILE IT IS STILL RUNNING, and it
// is the whole of what this package will say about a call before the call is
// over.
//
// ── WHY IT EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A task room can draw a worker's call — the model thinking, the token count
// climbing, the seconds since it went out — because a worker's turn streams
// through the session's own observer. Nothing else does. A division, a sizing
// pass, a mark being read are each ONE call through internal/session's
// callRole, and every one of them draws nothing at all while it runs: measured
// on 2026-09-10 those calls ran between 12 and 219 seconds with a blank line
// over them, which is indistinguishable from a process that has stopped.
//
// The events were never missing. Every streamed call in this process already
// reports each moment of its stream to a hazard controller ([streamWatch.note]
// in armwatch.go), which is where the tokens, the first token, the heartbeats
// and the silences are counted for the waiting policy. This seam forwards what
// that one place already knows, so there is no second decoder and no second
// count of anything.
//
// ── WHY IT RIDES THE CONTEXT ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The same reason [WithPatientRateLimits] does, said in patience.go and true
// here: the adapter is SHARED. A task node's agent talks through the very same
// *Client the person's conversation does, so a field on the client would have
// a division's progress drawn over a conversation's. The call is the only thing
// that knows whose call it is, and the context is what the call already
// carries — which is also what lets a caller attach this without any file it
// does not own already being changed.
//
// ── IT IS CALLED FROM THE READ LOOP, SO IT MUST DO NO WORK ──────────────────
//
// The one rule this seam has, and it is the same rule [WithPacingNotice] has:
// the function is called SYNCHRONOUSLY from the goroutine reading the stream,
// between two deltas of the person's answer. It may set a field and announce.
// It may not take a lock somebody else holds, write a file, or call back into
// this package. Anything it does is time the answer is not being read in.

	Served string
	// Attempt names WHICH CONCURRENT REQUEST of this question this is: 0 for the

	// overwrite the request it was sent to save — and so that the loser's
	// [CallEndCancelled] does not read as the question having been abandoned.
	//
	// IT IS NOT A COUNT OF TRIES. A call that walks to a second machine keeps its
	// number and says so with a fresh Started; what changes is where it is, never
	// how many goes it has had.
	Attempt int
	// Started is when THIS ATTEMPT really went out, and it MOVES: a call that is

//
// ── THE DERIVATION ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A report that arrives between two paints is drawn identically to one that
// never arrived: the reader holds the newest [CallProgress] and paints it, so
// two reports inside one frame differ only in which of them is thrown away. The
// quantity to match is therefore the surface's own frame, and this build has
// exactly one — `internal/tui3`'s `frameInterval`, 33 ms, the LOCAL cadence
// every animation on the chat surface is counted in (app.go). A surface read
// over a connection paints on `remoteFrameInterval`, three of those, and steps
// the same distance through each frame (link.go's `app.frameEvery` and
// `app.frameStride`) — so the link's stride is COARSER and holding a local
// surface to it would stutter a token count on one frame in three.
//
// So the beat is the local frame and not the link's, and 33 ms is the figure it
// carries. This package cannot import `internal/tui3` — a surface may depend on
// a transport and never the other way — so the two constants are named here
// instead, and a change to `frameInterval` is a change to this (PERF.md carries
// the pair).
//
// THE MOMENTS THAT ARE NEWS ARE EXEMPT FROM IT — the first token, the phase turning
// over, the machine naming itself, the ending — for the same reason they are
// there at all: each happens once, and each changes what the row says rather
// than what a number in it reads.
const callProgressBeat = 33 * time.Millisecond

// CallWatcher receives one call's progress synchronously and in order. It is a
// function and not a one-method interface for the reason [StreamObserver] is:
// every watcher in this build is a closure over a surface's own row, and an
// interface would be a named type each of them had to declare to say the same
// thing.

// installed from one site — hedge.go's startArm, under [Client.raceFor]'s gate —
// so a build with no controller installed (`internal/lane`'s seam, which a
// shipped binary always fills) reports nothing either. A watcher attached to a
