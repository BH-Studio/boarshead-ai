// transcribe.go is the media client's fourth door: audio in, words out.
//
// The other three doors on this client MAKE things — a picture, a voice, a
// film. This one is the only one that PERCEIVES, and it exists because the
// belt above it needs a rung that turns a sound file into text without asking a
// chat model to think about it: transcription is a cheap, purpose-built
// endpoint, and a session that reaches for a general model first pays a
// multiple of the price for the same sentence.
//
// THE WIRE SHAPE CAME FROM v1's MICROPHONE CLIENT, MIRRORED RATHER THAN
// IMPORTED. That client had been posting to /audio/transcriptions since v1 and
// its request is the one this deployment answers: JSON, not multipart, with the
// bytes as a base64 `input_audio` object carrying a bare format word. It was a
// surface's own client — its own key, its own timeout, its own Usage type — and
// importing it here would have made the media client depend on a TUI's audio
// stack to reach an endpoint it already knew how to speak to. So the shape was
// copied rather than shared, exactly as tools_pdf.go mirrors bare's truncation
// constants, and it travels through this client's own postJSON so it inherits
// the bearer key, the attribution headers, the response cap and the cost-header
// accounting every other media call has. The package it was copied from was
// removed once no surface imported it; this file is now the only transcription
// transport, and transcribe_test.go is what pins the shape.
