// ── ONE REFUSAL OBJECT, THREE READERS ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// A refusal used to be classified three times, by three pieces of code that had
// each been told a different half of the truth, and the class that mattered
// most fell through all three.
//
// ── THE MEASURED FAILURE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A chat run on 2026-09-01 collected six HTTP 404s of one shape:
//
//	Providers serving <model>: digitalocean, streamlake, baidu, deepinfra,
//	but your request's provider.only preference permits only: coreweave
//
// That sentence means ONE thing — the machine this request demanded cannot
// serve this model — and it is the one refusal class that is certain about a
// lane. Nothing acted on it. The strike ([Client.refuseUpstream]) required
// `provider_name` in the error metadata, which the router omits precisely when
// it is answering for itself; the ladder's first rung was offered only for
// `require_parameters`, `ignore` and `max_price`, so a pinned request climbed
// six rungs still pinned to the lane that had said no; the frontier went on
// scoring the lane because nothing wrote the refusal back; and the surface drew
// the whole thing as `· slow · trying nextbit…`, a sentence about a wait. The
// same lane was chosen three separate times in one run.
//
// Three mirror-image defects and one mute surface, and every one of them is a
// reading of the same fact. So the fact is decided ONCE, here, and read three
// times:
//
//	(a) the strike        velocity.go's [Client.refuseUpstream]
//	(b) the ladder/walk   endpoints.go's [Client.relaxationPlan], hedge.go's walk
//	(c) the screen        [RescueNews] → internal/session → internal/tui3
//
// ── THE LANE COMES FROM OUR OWN REQUEST, NEVER FROM THEIR PROSE ─────────────
//
// The refusal above names the lane twice in English, and reading it out of
// there would work until the day the router rewords it — which is exactly the
// failure docs/design/failsafe/FAILSAFE.md rule 1 is about, and exactly what
// endpoints.go's phrase list was demoted to a hint for. THE LANE A REFUSAL IS
// ABOUT IS THE LANE OUR REQUEST DEMANDED, which this process wrote itself, knows
// exactly, and can read with no parsing at all ([Client.onlyLane]).

// refusalKind is what a refusal IS, decided from structure alone.

	// no reader at all is the defect this class closes.

// and it is here rather than at a reader for exactly that reason: the law test
// forbids a call site choosing an action from a status, and the only way to keep
// that promise is for the transport to name the shape once. 402 is on it for
// completeness — the router answers a spent balance with one — and 429 is not,
// because pacing is a queue rather than an account.
