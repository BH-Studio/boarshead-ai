// docs/design/recovery/DESIGN.md §7's acceptance, said as a scenario rather than
// as an argument. The worst case of the eleven controllers was a product nobody
// could state — 3 models × 4 attempts × 5 arms × 6 paced sends × 9 rungs — and
// what replaced it is one figure a person could be told: `lane.Role.GiveUp`.
// These two scenarios are what that has to mean on the wire.

// scriptedPool is a router whose machines each behave the way one row of the
// census behaves: a rate limit, an account policy refusal, a server error, or an
// answer. It records the lane and the exclusion list of every send, because the
// claims under test are about counts and about who was asked.
