// cache key, the usage-accounting opt-in, and the per-phase reasoning knob that
// the pinned AgentField SDK's Request type has no field for. Everything else in

// neutral message and response types and never learns a wire detail.

// CONCURRENTLY with six different transcripts. They are then six growing,
// unrelated prefixes competing for one replica's cache, which is what the
// ledgers showed: cache reads quantized in 256-token steps, a third of the
// re-sent dollars missing a cache that a stable prompt should have hit.
//
// Narrowing to the leaf splits those six lineages apart. What it gives up is the
// shared head — the system message and the tool block, which every leaf of a run
// really does share byte for byte — now written cold once per leaf instead of
// once per run. That trade is not close: the head is a few thousand tokens
// written once per leaf, and the tail it protects is the whole transcript
// re-sent on every turn of that leaf. On Anthropic-family endpoints it is not
// even a trade, because their cache is content-addressed and the explicit
// breakpoint on the head is shared across leaves whatever the routing key says.
