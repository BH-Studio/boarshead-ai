// where no action is possible at all, and the waiting controller — which hedges,
// asks or reports at the role's ceiling — must always get there first. A
// transport bound underneath that ceiling inverts the two, and the inversion is
// not a near-miss: the controller's act is a second request beside a stream that
// is still open, while the transport's is a torn one plus a whole retry that
// pays the prompt again. The cheap rescue has to come first, every time.

// It reads the roles out of [lane.Roles] rather than spelling them again here,
// so a role added to that table tomorrow is held to this law without anybody
