// ── WHETHER THIS BASE CARRIES WHAT WE ASKED FOR ─────────────────────────────
//
// `internal/lane` decides which endpoint a request should prefer, lanepin.go
// holds the answer a PERSON gave to the same question, and this file answers
// the one question underneath both: will the machine on the other end carry
// that answer at all.
//
// IT USED TO BE ANSWERED BY A HOSTNAME. [Client.shippedRouterHint] — spelled
// `isOpenRouter` until issue #433 — tests the base URL for `openrouter.ai` and
// the model id for the prefix `openrouter/`, and it decided whether the
// `provider` object went on the wire at all. So on a proxy, a mirror, a
// self-hosted router or the shipped router reached by its IP, a person could
// rank lanes (which #419 made work), pin one, watch the settings row go on
// reading `pinned: X` — and the preference was never sent. Nothing errored,
// nothing logged, and the request that went out was the request `auto` would
// have sent. That is a silent substitution, which is the thing this
// repository's law forbids.
//
// THE LAW, and it is the same law #419 wrote one layer up: whether a base
// honours routing preferences is learned the same way its sheet is — once per
// base, by asking, and remembered, never from the hostname or a model prefix.
// A PREFERENCE THE WIRE WILL NOT CARRY IS SAID, NOT DROPPED: the person is told
// their pin cannot be sent on this base, in one visible line, rather than the
// pin being quietly left off the request.
//
// WHERE THE ANSWER LIVES. Beside the sheet's own answer, in internal/lane
// (sheet.go's [lanes.PrefsCarried]), because it is a fact about a base and the
// sheet is the one thing in this build that already keeps facts per base and
// forgets them when the base moves. This file is only the transport half: what
// on an answer teaches it, and what a person is told when it says no.
//
// ── WHAT TEACHES IT, AND WHAT IT CANNOT TELL APART ──────────────────────────
//
// Three readings, all of them of a request that was going out anyway:
//
//	served a lane sheet   carries — the router's own contract, filed by the
//	                      sheet itself, and the shipped router never pays a
//	                      request for the law
//	named the lane        carries — an answer whose `provider` field names the
//	                      machine that served it is a base speaking the
//	                      router's dialect ([Client.notePrefsFromAnswer])
//	refused naming        will not — a 4xx whose message names the `provider`
//	`provider`            field we put on ([prefRefused]), and the terminal no:
//	                      nothing takes it back while the base stays put
//	200, no lane named    will not — the honest limit, below, and the weaker
//	                      no: a later endpoints page takes it back
//
// AND THE LIMIT, SAID PLAINLY. A base that honoured the preference silently and
// a base that dropped it on the floor look IDENTICAL from here: an
// OpenAI-compatible answer carries nothing that says which machine served it,
// so there is no evidence that separates them. This build takes the reading
// that produces a sentence rather than the one that produces a silence — "no
// lane information" is read as "not carried" — because under the law a person
// who is told their pin is not being sent can act on it, and a person who is
// told nothing cannot. The request itself still goes out either way.

// carriesPreferences is THE DECISION: may a `provider` object go on this
// client's requests.
//
// IT IS NOT [Client.shippedRouterHint] AND MUST NEVER BE CONFUSED FOR IT. The
// hint is a substring of an address; this is what the address ANSWERED. An
// unasked base answers yes, because the asking is the sending and there is no
// other way to learn.
func (c *Client) carriesPreferences() bool {
	return lanes.PrefsCarried(c.config.BaseURL)
}

// baseServesLanes reports whether this client's base has SHOWN it publishes an
// endpoints page — that a model here is served by several machines at all.
//
// IT IS THE OTHER ANSWER AND NOT THIS ONE. [Client.carriesPreferences] is
// "may a `provider` object go out", and it is true until a base refuses,
// because the asking is the sending. This is "does this base have a set of
// endpoints behind a model", and it is false until a base shows one, because
// the machinery it gates — the probe that buys a measurement of two lanes, the
// ladder that reads a 404 as a routing layer with nothing left to try — is
// machinery about a set, and a base with one endpoint has no set. The shipped
// router answers true with no request at all (internal/lane's WireSheet takes
// the hint from [LaneSheetCertain]).

// IT IS THE LAST ENCODE AND NOT A LATCH, and the difference is the whole reason
// the widened retry works. That retry carries no preference and is answered —
// often perfectly, naming its lane — by the very base that refused the field a
// moment earlier; read as evidence it would put the base straight back to
// "carries" and the next turn would pay the identical refusal.
//
// IT IS PER CLIENT AND NOT PER REQUEST, which is loose where two calls from one
// client overlap: a hedge's second arm encodes while the first is in flight.
// The looseness is bounded and one-sided — when routing is on every request
// carries a preference, so the two encodes agree; when it is off none do, and
// nothing is ever learnt — and the cost of being wrong is one sentence about a
// base that would have carried it, which the next endpoints page takes back

// prefRefused reads whether a refusal COULD be the base saying it does not know
// the field we put on it — and it is a question rather than an answer, because
// no reading of the words can settle it.
//
// ── WHY THE WORDS ARE NOT THE GATE ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A phrase list here was the first design and it was wrong in the way rule 1 of
// docs/design/failsafe/FAILSAFE.md warns about: a fail-safe detects by STRUCTURE
// or it is decoration. `Unrecognized request argument supplied: provider` and
// `invalid provider name` both name the field and both are 400s, and they mean
// opposite things — the first is a base that has never heard of it, the second
// is a base that reads it perfectly and did not like the VALUE. A list that
// matched "invalid" would mark such a base as refusing preferences FOR GOOD, on
// one bad lane name, and the person would never be asked again.
//
// SO THE RETRY IS THE TEST. What this function establishes is only that the
// question is worth asking: a 400, the base's own, on a request that really
// carried a preference, from a base that has not already shown it carries one.
// The answer comes from sending the same request again WITHOUT the object
// ([Client.widenPastTheUncarriedPreference]) — if that goes through, the field
// was the difference; if it fails too, the field was not, and nothing is learnt.
//
// THE STATUS IS 400 AND NEVER 404. A 404 from a router is `No endpoints found…`
// and `…your request's provider.only preference permits only: coreweave` — a
// base that READ the preference and had nothing to serve it with, which is the
// opposite of this class and is the retirement's business next door (lanepin.go,
// issue #456).
//
// AND THE REFUSAL IS THE BASE'S OWN. A 400 the router RELAYS carries the
// upstream's name in its metadata ([APIError.FromUpstream] reads the same
// field), and `Provider returned error` is a real relayed sentence that names
// the word and means nothing like this.
//
// The sentences seen in the wild are kept as a note and not as a gate:
// `Unrecognized request argument supplied: provider` (OpenAI), `unknown field
// "provider"` (several gateways), `Extra inputs are not permitted` (a pydantic
// server naming the field in its detail). None of them is required to match.
