// ── FIVE REFUSALS, ONE CALL SITE, ONE VERDICT EACH ──────────────────────────
//
// These are the five shapes docs/design/recovery/DESIGN.md §7 R2 names, staged
// against a REAL router (internal/lane/lanestub) and a real [Client], because
// what is being proved is the whole road: the refusal door reading the wire into
// typed facts, [Evidence] carrying them, and [taxonomy.Classify] turning them
// into exactly one move.
//
// EACH OF THEM USED TO BE ANSWERED BY A DIFFERENT RULE, and that is why they are
// in one table rather than five files. An account exclusion was
// `refusalobject.go`'s; an emptied set was `classOf`'s; our own bytes and a
// withdrawn model were the same 404 to everybody; and an overflow was a regex in
// internal/session that ran AFTER the verdict and returned before it could be
// read. A shape added to this table is a shape somebody had to state as a fact
// first, which is the point.

// overflowEnvelope is the router relaying an OpenAI-compatible overflow: the
// sentence is prose and says nothing structural, and the `code` is the fact.

	"However, you requested about 71000 tokens."

// knownCatalog is a price resolver that carries every model but the one named.
// It is what makes "the router no longer carries this model" a fact rather than
// the absence of a catalog — [Client.withdrawnModel] demands the positive form.
