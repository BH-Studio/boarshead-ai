// ── THE PROBE: THE TRANSPORT HALF ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `internal/lane`'s prober decides WHETHER a probe is worth buying — a person
// has started typing, nobody has bought one in the last twenty seconds, and
// somebody is actually waiting. This file is the request it buys: one token, to
// exactly one named lane, with the first-token wait timed and nothing else kept.
//
// IT IS THE LEANEST REQUEST THIS ADAPTER MAKES, ON PURPOSE. It does not go
// through the shaping chain, the endpoint-refusal ladder, the retry backoff or
// the call log, because none of those are measuring what a probe measures: what
// the wait to this lane, from this machine, is RIGHT NOW. A probe that was
// retried would time the retry; a probe that was reshaped would time a
// different request. So the body is written here, in full, and it is the only
// request in this package that is.
//
// The prompt is fixed and about ten tokens long. Fixed because two probes that
// timed different prompts would not be comparable, and short because prefill is
// the one part of a first-token wait that is nobody's endpoint's fault.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS: one prompt of ten tokens and one output token per lane, which
// is about two hundredths of a cent for a pair. What it buys: a measurement
// seconds old instead of a public aggregate half an hour old, and a warm
// connection, so that the real request's first token is not paying for a TLS
// handshake this one already paid.

// probePrompt is the ten tokens every probe sends. It asks for one word so that
// a lane which ignores `max_tokens: 1` still stops almost at once.
const probePrompt = "Reply with the single word ok and nothing else at all."

// probeCeiling is the longest a probe may take before it is abandoned. A lane
// that has not said anything in this long has failed the only question a probe
// asks, and waiting longer costs a goroutine and a connection for an answer
// nobody will use.
const probeCeiling = 10 * time.Second

// probeLane sends one probe to one lane and reports the wait before its first
// token.
//
// An error is a real answer and is returned as one — a lane that refuses, or a
// path that will not carry — but it carries no duration, because what a refusal
// times is the refusal.
