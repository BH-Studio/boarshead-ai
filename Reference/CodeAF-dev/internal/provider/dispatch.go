//
// This is the one place in this build that decides what a failed call does
// next, and the one place a request for a completion reaches the wire
// (`TestOneDispatcherSendsForACompletion`).
//
// WHAT IT REPLACED (docs/design/recovery/DESIGN.md §2 problem 1 and §4). Eleven
// controllers on one request path each owned a budget none of the others could
// see — three transport faults here, six or sixty paced sends here, two minutes
// or ten of pacing here, eight free moves here, four arms in hedge.go, seven
// rungs in endpoints.go, four attempts and two models in internal/session. Their
// product is nobody's number, and the call census of 2026-09-10 measured what it
// produced: chains of sixteen and seventeen identical sends to one machine,
// running eleven minutes, and ending refused anyway.
//
// THERE IS NOW ONE BOUND AND IT IS A DEADLINE IN THE PERSON'S OWN TIME
// ([control.Plan.Deadline], from `lane.Role.GiveUp` — ninety seconds for a
// conversation's turn, four and a half minutes for a task node). What comes next
// is [control.Next], a pure function whose order is the rule's order: another
// machine, the same machine once after the comeback it named itself when it is
// alone, a relaxed shape one rung at a time, none. Nothing under the plan owns a
// retry count, and none of the six constants this block used to hold exists.

// ── THE BODY IS WRITTEN PER ATTEMPT, NOT PER CALL ───────────────────────────
//
// THE MEASURED FAILURE (the census, docs/design/recovery/census-20260910.md §6).
// This loop used to be handed one encoded body above it and send those same
// bytes again on every attempt. The bytes carry `provider.order`, `provider.only`
// and `provider.ignore`, so "again" meant "to the same machine": 53 % of the
// multi-attempt chains in ten days never left the lane they started on, three of
// them spent sixteen and seventeen consecutive sends on one machine over eleven
// minutes, and every one of those ended 429 anyway. The chains that DID escape
// escaped on the one attempt that finally moved.
//
// THE LAW: A MACHINE THAT REFUSED THIS CALL IS NOT ASKED AGAIN WHILE ANOTHER ONE
// IS ADMISSIBLE. Each attempt re-encodes ([Client.encodeRequest]), and the
// encoder reads this set through [Client.dropRefusedHere], so the exclusion
// travels the same plumbing every other routing preference does rather than as a
// second opinion beside it. The same machine is re-asked only when the serving
// set under this request is one machine wide — a person's strict pin, a rescue's
// demand, an account-wide pacing that names nobody — and then only after the
// wait it asked for itself.

// refusedHere is every machine that has refused THIS CALL, and it is the whole
// of what makes the next attempt a different request rather than the same one.
//
// IT IS THE CALL'S OWN MEMORY AND NOT THE LEDGER'S. The ledger
// ([velocityLedger.pace]) already holds what the process believes about a
// machine, on its own cooldown, shared by every session in the process; this is
// narrower and shorter-lived — one call's list of who has already said no to it
// — and it is what keeps a machine out of the very next body even when the
// ledger declined to write anything at all (an upstream that named no wait, a
// stream that died before naming its server, a 4xx over a list).
//
// It is carried on [callKnobs] by pointer because the knobs travel by value
// through the repair, relax and ladder chains, and what must not be copied is
// the answer to "who has already refused this call".

// minutes for a watched call, sixty or ten for a patient one — and `patienceOf`

// [control.Plan.Spent] is the one place a call gives up, on one deadline in the
// person's own time, and the ordinal's denominator is how many machines this
// request may really go to.

// backoffFor is how long to wait before one retry.
//
// Exponential and jittered, so several leaves that were rate-limited together
// do not all come back at the same instant and trigger it again. The provider's
// own Retry-After raises that wait when it named a later moment — it knows its
// own pacing better than the formula does — but only up to maxProviderWait.
// The header may be an HTTP date, and a date is how a wait becomes hours: the
// old code took it literally and applied it, and then went on applying it to
// every later attempt of the same call.
//
// ONE WAIT IS NEVER LONGER THAN maxProviderWait, whatever asked for it — the
// header, or the doubling. A patient call (patience.go) has no attempt ceiling
// to keep the exponent small, so the cap is what keeps its waits a minute
// apart instead of an hour, and it is what makes an interrupt land promptly:
