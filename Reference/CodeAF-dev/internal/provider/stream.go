	// StreamThinking says the model is producing reasoning rather than answer.

	// The TOOL ACTIVITY boundaries. They are not produced by the adapter — no
	// endpoint reports them — but by whoever is RUNNING the tool loop above it,
	// through [Emit]. They ride this vocabulary rather than a second channel
	// because the person is watching one turn: a read the head performed and a
	// word it streamed are the same turn happening, and two feeds would have to
	// be re-interleaved by every surface that drew them.
	//
	// StreamToolBegin carries a person-readable gloss of the call in Delta —
	// "searching for «navctx»", never the raw arguments. The two ends carry a
	// short result hint, which is very often empty.
	//
	// THE OUTCOME IS A KIND AND NOT A FIELD, so the event struct stays three
	// strings wide and every bridge between vocabularies stays a copy.

	// StreamReasoning carries one chunk of the model's reasoning TEXT in Delta.
	//
	// It is the companion of StreamThinking and not its replacement: thinking
	// says a run of reasoning has begun and is raised once, this is raised per
	// delta and carries the words. Both are emitted, in that order, because a
	// surface that only draws "thinking…" must keep working unchanged and a
	// surface that wants the text must not have to infer where the run started.
	//
	// The wire spells it two ways — OpenRouter's "reasoning" and the
	// "reasoning_content" the DeepSeek-family endpoints send — and sse.go reads
	// both into one field, so what leaves here is one vocabulary regardless.
	StreamReasoning
	// StreamToolCallReady says ONE tool call has finished streaming, before the
	// response it belongs to has. Delta is that call JSON-marshaled — an
	// ai.ToolCall object, id and function and all, not a gloss — because the
	// consumer is code deciding whether to start work, not a person reading a
	// line.
	//
	// It is raised when the stream opens a LATER call (the one before it can
	// receive no more fragments) and, for whatever is still open, once the
	// stream ends cleanly. A call is only announced when its name is known and
	// its arguments parse as JSON: a fragment boundary misread would otherwise
	// hand a consumer a truncated instruction, and "not yet" is always a safe
	// answer here — the response's own ToolCalls() remains the authority.
	//
	// NOTHING IS PROMISED ABOUT WHO RUNS IT. This is an early sighting, not a
	// dispatch: see the safety law in session/loop.go for which calls may act on
	// one and which must wait for the response.
	StreamToolCallReady
	// StreamToolCallForming says ONE tool call is still ARRIVING: the model has
	// begun spelling it out and has not finished. Index, ID and Tool name the
	// call as far as the wire has said them — the index is always known, the id
	// and the name arrive on the first fragment or shortly after — and Delta
	// carries the call's ACCUMULATED ARGUMENTS TEXT so far, raw and partial.
	//
	// IT IS RAW ON PURPOSE. The arguments of a half-sent call are not JSON yet,
	// so nothing here may be unmarshaled and nothing downstream may treat this as
	// an instruction. It is the answer to "what is it doing right now" for the
	// seconds between the model starting a long write and the call being whole —
	// seconds a surface with only StreamToolCallReady has to draw as silence.
	//
	// It is raised PER FRAGMENT, which is per token for the endpoints that stream
	// arguments a token at a time. That rate is deliberate and the consumer's
	// problem: this vocabulary reports the wire, and whoever is drawing decides
	// how often a person needs to see it (session/toolhint.go throttles it).
	//
	// EVERY CALL THAT FORMS IS LATER READY, in that order, unless the stream dies
	// mid-call — the same condition under which StreamToolCallReady says nothing
	// either. A non-streaming endpoint raises none of these at all.
	StreamToolCallForming
	// StreamNotice carries one line ABOUT the call rather than from it, in Delta.
	//
	// It is the only kind the adapter itself raises that is not the model
	// speaking, and it exists for exactly one thing today: the endpoint-refusal
	// chain saying which attempt it is on and what it just took off the request
	// (endpoints.go). A retry that reshapes a person's request has to be visible
	// or it is an adapter answering a different question from the one it was
	// asked — and the only channel that reaches the room in order is this one.
	//
	// It is raised BEFORE the stream opens, so a surface may receive notices on a
	// turn that goes on to produce no StreamStarted at all.
	StreamNotice
	// StreamReplaced says the answer the person has been reading is being
	// REPLACED, and carries in Delta the one line telling them so.
	//
	// It is StreamNotice's sibling and deliberately not StreamNotice itself: a
	// notice is a line to print, while a replacement is that line AND an
	// instruction to throw away what is above it. It is raised only when text
	// had actually been shown. Everything the consumer drew or buffered for this
	// response is void, and the response the call returns is the replacement's.
	StreamReplaced
	// StreamRowNews carries one line about A PERSON'S OWN ROW in Delta — a pin
	// the wire has refused and this build has stopped sending (lanepin.go), a
	// base that has said it will not carry one at all (prefcarry.go).
	//
	// IT IS [StreamNotice]'s SIBLING AND DELIBERATELY NOT StreamNotice ITSELF,
	// for the reason [StreamReplaced] is not: a notice is the adapter saying
	// what it did to the person's REQUEST to get it accepted, and a surface is
	// free to fold that away with the rest of the machinery once the answer has
	// landed. This is the adapter saying that a SETTING they wrote is no longer
	// being sent, and there is nothing to fold it into — it is the only account
	// they will get of why the machine they named stopped appearing.
	//
	// THE MEASURED FAILURE (2026-09-13). The retirement sentence went out on
	// StreamNotice, arrived as a note, and was swallowed whole by the chat's
	// work chip: one drive, `@deepseek` gone from the model word, another
	// machine answering, and `▸ worked 1.6s · thought 0.2s · ctrl+e` where the
	// explanation should have been.
	//
	// It is raised BEFORE the stream opens, exactly as StreamNotice is, so a
	// surface may receive one on a turn that goes on to produce no
	// StreamStarted at all.
