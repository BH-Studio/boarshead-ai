// THE TWO DEGENERATE TEXTS ARE REAL. They were streamed by
// deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro-0813 into one conversation on 2026-08-20, at about
// 150k input tokens, and are excerpted verbatim into testdata: the first
// collapses into multi-script soup ("стаthisada", "済", a run of six hundred
// letter s), and the second ends in several thousand repetitions of "    0\n".
// Both were recorded in the transcript, both went back into the next request,
// and the second was worse than the first.
//
// The innocents beside them are the shapes a legitimate reply takes that LOOK
// like those two from a distance: text that compresses to nothing because it is
// a matrix or a log, and text that mixes alphabets because the answer is about
// more than one language. Every one of them must survive.

// absolute ceiling from #786.
//
// WHAT THE CENSUS GOT RIGHT AND WHAT IT GOT WRONG, because the correction is
// what these tests are for. 869 rows read `decode stream: context deadline
// exceeded` with `ms` at exactly 90,000 and 60,000, and 780 of them had already
// taken a first token — a live stream, guillotined, and the largest single
// error class in ten days. The census attributed it to the stream wall. It is
// not the wall and it is not in this package at all: `clientFor` already sets
// no total deadline on a streamed request, `attemptContext` gives a stream a
// cancel and never a timeout, and every bound in this file announces itself as
// a [StreamCut] with its own sentence rather than as a context error. Those
// rows carry a deadline set by the CALLER, at two and three times a role's
// ceiling. So what this package owes is not another removal — it is a proof
// that the removal holds, and an honest record of which bound really fired
// ([streamWatch.applied]).
