// ── WHAT A PERSON SAID ABOUT THE MACHINE ────────────────────────────────────
//
// `internal/lane` decides which endpoint a request should prefer. This file is
// the one place a PERSON'S answer to the same question overrides it: the
// `lane.<slot>` row and the `lane.guard` row (internal/config's settings.go),
// resolved once by the surface and handed down.
//
// IT IS A PROCESS-WIDE KNOB AND NOT A FIELD ON Config, for two reasons. The row
// is about a SESSION and not about an adapter, and two clients in one process —
// the conversation's and a tool loop's own — must not hold two different answers
// to "which machine did they ask for". (The other process-wide knob this used to
// cite, `SetHedgeBudget`, is deleted: what a call may spend rescuing itself is a
// figure on its own plan now and not a switch anybody throws.) And the row is
// written WHILE THE PROCESS IS
// RUNNING, by the picker (internal/tui3's pinLane), and a pin that only took
// effect at the next launch would be a promise this build did not keep. A
// settings read per request would keep it too — at the cost of a disk read in
// front of every first token, which is the one thing the lane law forbids
// hardest — so the surface WRITES the answer here when it writes the row.
//
// The read is a mutex over two words on a path that already takes several, and
// the write happens when somebody presses enter in a list.

// LanePin is a person's answer to "which machine serves this model", already
// resolved from the settings row.
//
// The three states of the row are three states here, and the zero value is
// `auto` — nobody said, and the belief chooses per answer.
//
//	auto          Lane empty, OpenRouter false   the belief chooses
//	pinned        Lane named, Borrow false       exactly that machine, or nothing
//	pinned+borrow Lane named, Borrow true        that machine first, and a rescue may leave it
//	openrouter    OpenRouter true                no lane choice at all; the router balances

	// Lane is the machine named by the row, as the wire spells it. Empty is a
	// row that names none.
	Lane string
	// Borrow is whether a PINNED lane may still be left when it goes slow. It
	// is false unless somebody said so: a pin means the machine they named, and
	// widening it on their behalf is not this build's to do.

	// one at 16:30:02, one at 16:35:00, in one process, in one measured run,
	// with nobody having touched the row.
	//
	// A PERSON'S OWN ACT COMES IN THROUGH [RepinLane] INSTEAD, and it forgets

// ── A PIN THE WIRE HAS ALREADY REFUSED ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// Issue #456, and the ruling #375 asked for. As shipped, a strict pin puts
// `provider.only: [name]` on EVERY request; the router answers the
// `permits only:` 404; and the next request demands the same machine again.
// Every turn of a session pays a 404 round trip to learn a fact this process
// already knows — and on the turn's own unhedged call, with nowhere to walk to,
// the turn simply ended and the person read the router's sentence.
//
// A PIN IS RETIRED FOR THE MODEL IT WAS REFUSED FOR. A `permits only:` refusal
// is not an outage and not a slow lane: it is the router saying the PAIRING is
// impossible, which is exactly the one refusal class the object next door calls
// Terminal. So the pair is written down here, and every later request for that
// model routes on auto — exactly as if the row read `auto`.
//
// FOUR THINGS IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not touch the settings file:
// the row a person wrote is theirs and stays as they wrote it. It does not
// retire the pin for any OTHER model, because the refusal was about a pairing.
// It does not outlive the process. And it does not survive somebody CHANGING
// the row — [SetLanePin] forgets every retirement when the answer moves,
// because pinning is a person stating the instruction afresh and this build
// does not get to remember an argument they have just re-opened.
//
// THE POLICY LIVES HERE AND NOT IN refusalobject.go. That file answers what a
// refusal IS — a fact about the wire — and what a person's standing instruction
// should do about it is a fact about the ROW, which is this file's subject.

// retiredPins is the set of (pinned lane, ledger model) pairs the router has
// refused this run, guarded by [lanePinMu] alongside the knob itself because
// the two are read together on the same request path and a second lock would be
// a second thing to reason about in front of somebody's first token.
//
// IT IS KEYED BY THE PAIR AND NOT BY THE LANE. "cloudflare cannot serve this
// model" is a fact about one model, and a person pinning cloudflare for a
// second model is asking a question this refusal did not answer.
//
// AND IT IS PER RUN RATHER THAN PER TURN OR PER SESSION, which is the whole of
// what makes the 404 get paid once. A conversation, the errands beside it and
// every task node it starts are one process and read this one map; a build that
