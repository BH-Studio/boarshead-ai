// ── WHAT ONE ARM'S ROW SAYS ABOUT ITSELF ────────────────────────────────────

// TestTheRowSaysWhichBoundReallyEndedTheAttempt is `deadline_ms` stopping being
// fiction (`docs/design/recovery/DESIGN.md` §7, and the seam R0's call log
// reads).
//
// WHAT THE FIELD MEANT AND WHAT EVERY READER TOOK IT TO MEAN were two different
// things, and the 2026-09-10 census is the bill: 2,720 of 11,841 finished
// attempts ran more than TWICE their recorded deadline, the field reads 10,000
// on 7,937 rows, and the worst pairs `deadline_ms 10000` with `ms 937777`. It
// was never a bound on the call — it is [streamWatch.armed], the moment the
// hazard was going to start THINKING about a second machine — so a census
// reading it as "when this call was going to be ended" concluded that six
// hundred streams had been guillotined by a wall that never touched them.
//
// The two facts now travel as two fields: what was planned, and what happened.
