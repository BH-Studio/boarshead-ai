//
// IT IS WRITTEN HERE BECAUSE EVERY OUTBOUND CALL IN THE PROCESS PASSES THROUGH
// HERE. The chat's turn, `codeaf do`, a plan's briefs and contracts, the
// delivery gate, a reflex, the document route — they are a dozen packages that
// share exactly one door, and a record written at that door cannot be missed by
// a caller who forgot to write one.
//
// ONE BUILDER, TWO PATHS. The non-streamed completion and the streamed one
// finish in different functions with different facts in hand, and a record
// assembled separately in each would have drifted the first time a field was
// added. Everything below funnels through [Client.record], which reads each
// field from where the adapter had already worked it out — the ceiling from
// thinking.go, the effort from the encoder's own resolvers, the serving
// endpoint from the decode, the relax rungs from the ladder — and computes
// nothing of its own.

// They are constants rather than literals at the four sites that write them,
// because a name that appears twice is a name that will one day be spelled two
