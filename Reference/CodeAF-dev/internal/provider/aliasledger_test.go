// ── THE SHIPPED DEFAULT, END TO END ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The model every install routes by default is a FLOATING ALIAS, and until this
// test nothing held the whole path to the consequence. The wire sends the alias
// and the router answers it; the endpoints page exists only under the concrete
// model it points at. So the beat asked for a sheet under one name, the sighting
// was filed under a second, and the machines that actually answered were a
// third's — one model, three ledger keys, and the default model of every install
// therefore chose between no lanes at all.
//
// It asserts on the FILE rather than on a double, because the file is what the
// next session opens.
//
// ITS TURN IS UNHEDGED, AND A RACED ONE IS THE TEST BELOW IT. `internal/provider`
// had a third writer of the ledger's model id — hedge.go's settle overwrote the
// spelling with the answer's own `model` field, not through [laneModel] — so a
// raced call filed its losing arm under a spelling nobody folded.
// [TestARacedArmIsFiledUnderTheOneNameTheLedgerKeys] is that door, staged on a
// stalled lane, because a loser only teaches the ledger anything once it has
// named itself.

// storedLanes is every model name the belief file and its journal carry, read
// back the way another process would read them.
//
// BOTH HALVES, BECAUSE ONE OF THEM IS NOT ENOUGH. Since the store became a
// state file plus an append-only journal (`v3/lanes.json` and `v3/lanes.log`),
// the compacted half is written on the first record of a process and every
// journalLimit-th after, and everything since sits in the journal. A sighting
// filed a moment ago is therefore usually in the log and not in the state — so
// an assertion that read only the state would pass on a ledger that is still
// split, which is the whole thing this test exists to catch.
//
// Belief and Sighting carry no json tags, so the field names are the Go ones.
