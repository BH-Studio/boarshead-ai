// ── THE CHIP AND THE WIRE READ ONE FACT ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE MEASURED FAILURE (issue #1022, dev 649392ad7). Morph was pinned from the
// settings sheet; the `lane` row read `pinned: Morph`, the status chip read
// `moonshotai/kimi-k3@morph`, and three turns were answered by Sail Research. A
// body carrying `{"only":["Morph"],"allow_fallbacks":false}` cannot be answered
// by another machine, so for those three turns the pin was not on the wire while
// the chrome said it was.
//
// The surface names the machine through one door ([PinNow]) and the wire draws
// its demand through another ([Client.drawLaneChoice]). This is the law that the
// two answer the same question: for every state the row and the run can be in,
// the machine a surface may name is exactly the machine the next request a
// person is reading would demand.

// demandedFor is what the wire would ask for on a call this person is waiting
// on — the `only` of the draw, or nothing where the draw makes no choice.

// THE LAW, WALKED OVER EVERY STATE OF THE ROW. Each step moves one fact — the
// row, the wire's answer to it, the base — and after each one the chip's fact
