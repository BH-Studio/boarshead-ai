// [adaptiveCompletionTimeout] — a total deadline that caps at fifteen minutes. A
// DeepSeek endpoint accepted a request and never answered; the leaf sat on it
// for 15m24s, a twenty-minute claim reaper then took the node away, and the run

// have caught it in ninety seconds already existed — streamguard.go's first
// delta bound, its mid-stream gap, its wall derived from the lane's own measured
// history — and every one of them was dormant because a stream nobody was
// reading was not a stream at all.
