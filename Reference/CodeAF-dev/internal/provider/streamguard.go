// THE GUARD OVER ONE MODEL STREAM.
//
// Two things go wrong with a request that the retry loop in retry.go cannot see,
// because both of them happen AFTER the response headers have arrived and a
// perfectly healthy-looking stream is open:
//
//   - SILENCE. The endpoint accepts the request and then says nothing, or says
//     so little that the answer will never arrive. The body watchdog in
//     transport.go counts ANY BYTE as progress, keepalive comments included, so
//     an endpoint that trickles colons down the wire forever is invisible to it.
//     What this counts instead is the model WRITING: a token of answer, a token
//     of reasoning, a fragment of a tool call. Nothing else moves the clock.
//
//     BUT AN ENDPOINT SPEAKING IS NOT AN ENDPOINT GONE. Keepalive comments do
//     not move the clock — they BUY PATIENCE instead, up to a hard cap. The
//     distinction was measured on 2026-08-24: five of the sixteen endpoints
//     serving one production model assemble a whole tool call server-side and
//     deliver it as a lump, keepalives flowing the entire time; the largest gap
//     seen was fifty seconds on a fourteen-kilobyte call that then FINISHED.
//     Cutting those streams at the plain bound turned every big write into a
//     guaranteed failure, three retries deep, while the answer was seconds from
//     landing. So a quiet stream whose endpoint is still speaking is given
//     [bufferedQuietBound] in total, and a quiet stream whose endpoint has
//     stopped speaking too is cut at the plain bounds — that one really is a
//     connection that is not coming back. The cap is what keeps the colon
//     trickler from owning this loop forever: patience is bounded, and the
//     bound is stated once, below.
//
//   - OVERRUN. The endpoint keeps writing and never stops. Every bound above
//     and every bound below is a SILENCE bound — the gap between two tokens,
//     the wait for the first one, the total quiet a buffering endpoint may
//     accumulate — and none of them has anything to say about a stream that
//     drips a token every second for half an hour. The streaming client's own
//     total deadline is switched off on purpose (retry.go's clientFor: a total
//     timeout killed every healthy long stream at the completion budget), so
//     until [streamWallFactor] there was NOTHING in this process that ended
//     such a request.
//
//     THIS IS INFERENCE FROM ABSENCE and it is worth saying plainly. In
//     SWE-Marathon run s10 the journal went thirty minutes with no row of any
//     kind — no call line, no error line (one is written per attempt now:
//     internal/session's journalFailedCall), and the last tool call had
//     returned in four tenths of a second. Nothing was proven to be dripping
//     tokens, because nothing recorded it. What IS a fact is that the only
//     unbounded thing left in the request path was a streamed reply, and that
//     the missing bound is missing whether or not it is what cost that run.
//
//   - DEGENERATION. The model loses the thread and writes soup — a run of one
//     letter, a paragraph repeated until the token budget is gone, words with
//     three alphabets inside them. It is a real thing that happened to this
//     session on 2026-08-20 against a 150k-token context, twice in one
//     conversation, and the second time was worse than the first BECAUSE THE
//     FIRST ONE WAS STILL IN THE CONTEXT. Junk in the transcript breeds junk.
//
// Both answers are the same shape: cut the request, say so, ask again. The
// asking again is [Agent.completeWithRetry]'s in internal/session, which already
// throws away the dead attempt's partial text, its warm tool batch and its
// half-arrived calls — this layer only detects, cuts, and names what happened.
//
// WHAT THIS LAYER NEVER DOES is decide the person's words. A cut leaves through
// [StreamCut], which internal/session turns into the sentence a person reads,
// for the reason patience.go gives about its own two seams: the words live where
// the words live.

	// about to answer is worse than waiting: the retry pays the whole prompt
	// again. Ninety seconds is past every healthy first token this adapter has

// ── THE WALL ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE LAW: EVERY REQUEST CARRIES A WALL AS WELL AS A SILENCE BOUND. The three
// constants above bound how long a stream may say NOTHING. These three bound
// how long it may go on saying something, and they are a different question
// with a different answer: a reply that is still arriving is not a connection
// that has died, so the wall cannot be a small number and cannot be a fixed
// one.
//
// IT IS DERIVED FROM WHAT THE LANE ITSELF HAS SERVED, and never from a table of
// model sizes. A size table is a claim this process cannot check — the catalog
// row that said one model held 1.3M tokens is why compaction believes an
// endpoint's refusal over a card's figure (internal/session's TrustedWindowFor)
// — whereas "the longest reply this endpoint has actually finished for us, this
// hour" is a measurement, and velocity.go is already keeping it. The wall is that figure times [streamWallFactor], clamped between
// [streamWallFloor] and [streamWallCeiling].
const (
	// streamWallFactor is how many times the longest reply a lane has COMPLETED
	// the next one may run before it is cut.
	//
	// FIVE, because the spread between two healthy replies from one endpoint is
	// dominated by how much the model chose to write, and that ratio is
	// routinely three or four to one inside a single session — a one-line
	// confirmation against a whole-file rewrite is exactly that. Five is past
	// the widest honest ratio and short of an order of magnitude, which is the
	// range a reply that is never going to end lives in. Two would cut real
	// answers; fifty would be no wall at all.
	streamWallFactor = 5
	// streamWallFloor is the wall a lane WITH NO HISTORY gets, and it is the
	// outer bound of this whole file: the answer to "how long may a request run
	// when this process has measured nothing at all about who is serving it".
	//
	// It is five minutes because that is already this adapter's argued answer to
	// the same question asked about the same work delivered in one piece:
	// adaptiveCompletionTimeout's floor. A non-streamed call gets at least five
	// minutes in total, so a streamed one gets at least five minutes of
	// generation — and it gets that on the very first request of a cold process,
	// where there is nothing measured to multiply.
	//
	// IT IS NO LONGER THE FLOOR UNDER A MEASURED LANE, and that is the fix. A
	// floor that outranked the measurement made the measurement pointless: a
	// lane whose longest finished reply was twenty-four seconds still got five
	// whole minutes, so "derived from the lane's own history" was true of the
	// arithmetic and false of every fast endpoint in practice. Two streams in
	// the dogfood run of 2026-08-31 hung for exactly this figure, on lanes that
	// were demonstrably sustaining between 83 and 270 tokens a second. A lane
	// this process HAS measured is bounded by [streamWallMeasuredFloor] instead.
	streamWallFloor = 5 * time.Minute
	// streamWallMeasuredFloor is the least a lane whose history we hold may be
	// given, and it is [bufferedQuietBound] rather than a number of its own.
	//
	// The two bound the same thing from opposite sides and must not disagree.
	// A stream may legitimately go quiet for the buffered cap while its endpoint
	// assembles an answer server-side; a wall shorter than that cap would cut a
	// stream the silence bounds were still being patient with, which is a
	// guaranteed failure on exactly the deliveries the buffered cap was measured
	// to protect. So the shortest honest wall is the longest honest silence, and
	// it is written as that constant rather than as a second copy of its value.
	streamWallMeasuredFloor = bufferedQuietBound
	// streamWallCeiling is where a request ends whatever its lane's history
	// claims.
	//
	// Twenty minutes. The measured failure it exists for ran for thirty and was
	// still running when the run was killed, so a ceiling that could reach
	// thirty would not have caught it. Past twenty minutes on one request the
	// arithmetic has flipped anyway: re-asking a different endpoint pays the
	// prompt again, which is minutes at worst, against a wait that has already
	// cost more than that and has produced no evidence it will ever end.
	//
	// It is also what keeps one pathological completion from poisoning the
	// ledger. A lane that once took nineteen minutes and finished cannot use
	// that to buy itself an hour.
	//
	// AND IT IS THE ONE BOUND NO EVIDENCE MOVES. A wall re-armed on a stream
	// that kept pace ([stallWatch.keptPace]) is re-armed up to here and never
	// past it: twenty minutes at forty tokens a second is forty-eight thousand
	// tokens, past any honest single reply this program asks for, so a stream
	// still writing at the ceiling is not a long answer, it is one that is not
	// going to end.
	streamWallCeiling = 20 * time.Minute
)

// ── THE WALL BOUNDS A REPLY THAT IS NOT WORKING, NEVER A REPLY THAT IS LONG ─
//
// THE WALL USED TO BE BLIND TO PROGRESS, and on 2026-09-10 it cost a whole
// task. A lane that had only ever finished five-to-nine-second tool-call turns
// earned the measured floor, two and a half minutes, which at forty tokens a
// second is a hard cap of about six thousand tokens of output. The task asked
// for one self-contained HTML file of about nine thousand. Three attempts on
// three endpoints streamed 5,510, 3,576 and 26,145 tokens at the lane's normal
// rate the whole time, and each was cut at its wall with nothing wrong with it;
// $1.46 of the task's $1.74 was output thrown away. The retry ran the identical
// request into the identical wall, and the ledger could never learn the longer
// reply either, because [velocityLedger.noteRun] learns only from a reply that
// FINISHED and a wall too short for the reply is a wall no reply finishes under.
// That chicken-and-egg needs no mechanism of its own: it is the blindness above
// seen from the ledger's side, and it ends with it.
//
// SO WHEN THE WALL FIRES, IT ASKS BEFORE IT CUTS. The question is the one a
// person would ask of a reply still arriving — is it arriving at the speed this
// lane writes at? — answered from what the watch counted over the period the
// wall was armed for, against what the lane's own measured rate would have
// produced over the same period ([stallWatch.keptPace]). A stream that kept
// pace is long and healthy, and the wall RE-ARMS for another period. A stream
// that did not — the drip the wall was written for, a token every few seconds
// against a lane that writes forty — is cut exactly as before, with the same
// sentence.
//
// THIS IS NOT THE WALL BEING PUSHED BY CHUNKS, which [stallWatch.rewall] rightly
// forbids. No chunk moves it. It is re-derived ONCE PER PERIOD, from a
// measurement of pace over the whole of that period, and it can never pass
// [streamWallCeiling]. A drip that sends a token a second cannot buy a second
// period, however many tokens it sends, because the question is how many
// arrived against how many the lane writes in that time.
//
// KEEPING PACE IS A FIFTH OF THE LANE'S RATE, AND THE FIFTH IS
// [streamWallFactor]. The wall's own factor was argued from the spread between
// two healthy replies — three or four to one, and a reply that is never going to
// end is an order of magnitude off — and the same spread bounds a rate: a lane
// under load, a reply decoding deep into a long context, a batched endpoint
// delivering in bursts, all move the rate by less than the widest honest ratio,
// and a drip is ten or a hundred times under it. So the one number answers both
// sides of the same question and is not stated twice.
//
// A LANE WITH NO MEASURED RATE IS HELD TO [LagRate] ([paceFor]). It is the one
// rate this process already asserts about every endpoint before it has timed
// any: an endpoint that finishes under it is called slow. A fifth of that is six
// tokens a second — under every healthy lane this adapter has measured (the
// slowest on 2026-09-10 sustained twenty-four) and far over a drip — so a
// stranger's drip is caught at its first wall exactly as it always was, and a
// stranger's long reply is not. The stream's own first-period rate was the other
// candidate and it is the wrong one: a drip measured against itself keeps pace
// with itself forever, and would run to the ceiling on every stranger.
//
// THE RULE IS STRICTLY MORE PATIENT THAN THE ONE IT REPLACES. Every stream the
// old wall cut is either cut at the same moment or re-armed; nothing is ever cut
// earlier. That is what lets a measured rate that overstates a lane — a reply
// whose thinking was billed and never streamed — be used without fear: the worst
// it can do is decline a re-arm the old wall never offered.

// paceFor is the rate, in tokens a second, a stream on a lane measured at `rate`

//
// THE TRANSPORT IS THE LAST RESORT AND NOT A SECOND CONTROLLER. Decision 10 of
// docs/ARCHITECTURE.md states the order and the waiting design (§A, and "what
// this deliberately does not do") restates it: the waiting controller acts on a
// silence — it hedges, it asks, it reports — and every bound in this file exists
// for the one case where no action is possible at all. So each of them must sit
// strictly ABOVE the ceiling the controller acts at.
//
// THEY DID NOT, AND THE ARITHMETIC SAYS SO PLAINLY. A role's ceiling is its
// patience times [lane.VisiblePatience]: thirty seconds for `leaf.unattended`,
// `memory` and `auxiliary`, sixty for `standing`, `judge` and `design`. A
// mid-stream bound of forty-five seconds — fifteen once [gapFor] had narrowed it
// onto a fast lane — cut those streams BEFORE the controller had reached the
// ceiling it would have rescued them at. The two are not the same event and the
// order between them is not a detail: the controller's act is a second request
// beside a stream that is still open, and the transport's is a torn one plus a
// whole retry that pays the prompt again. The cheap rescue has to come first.
//
// SO THE THREE FIGURES ABOVE ARE WHAT A PATIENCE OF ONE GETS, and every request
// is guarded by them scaled to the role that asked. Scaling keeps each argument
// intact — the ninety seconds is still past every healthy first token, the
// forty-five is still half of it — and moves the whole family with the ceiling
// it has to clear, because the ceiling is the same multiplier applied to the
// same ten seconds.

	// lane's measured rate, and a lane fast enough drives that derivation down
	// to a figure no multiplier rescues.
	//
	// TWO, because the controller acting is not the controller finished. At the
	// ceiling it puts a second request on the wire, and that request has its own
	// handshake, its own router hop and its own first token to pay before it can
	// rescue anything — which is the same order of time as the ceiling itself. A
	// transport bound one ceiling above would cut the stream while the rescue it
	// triggered was still in flight, which buys the torn request straight back.

	// somewhere before it failed, and the autopsy question about it — was this
