// ── THE LADDER, RUNG BY RUNG ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One question escalates in one order and the order is written down
// (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, "The ladder"):
//
//	1  the same model, another LANE — the watch's hedge
//	2  the same model, the remaining gate-passing lanes — the walk
//	3  the same model, a RELAXED request — and only for a refusal, never for
//	   slowness
//	4  another MODEL
//
// THE ORDER IS THE WHOLE POINT. Every rung past the first answers a slightly
// different question from the one that was asked, and the rungs are sorted by
// how different: a second machine behind the same model answers exactly the
// question; a request with its tools stripped answers a smaller one; another
// model answers somebody else's. A build that reached for rung three because
// rung two was never tried took the tools off a request that only needed a
// different endpoint.

// ladderChoice is a frontier of three lanes in a stated order, which is what
// the chooser hands a request it has an opinion about.
