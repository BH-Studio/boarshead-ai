// How an outbound call is bounded, and why a stream is bounded differently.
//
// http.Client.Timeout is a deadline on the *whole* exchange, body reads
// included. For a request/response completion that is exactly right: the answer
// arrives in one piece and a call still open after the adaptive budget is a
// wedged call. For a stream it is a bug with a stopwatch on it — every stream
// died at the timeout no matter how healthily it was delivering, which at the
// default 32k max tokens meant a hard stop at eight and a half minutes,
// mid-sentence, with no resume.
//
// So a stream is bounded by silence instead. Two things replace the total
// deadline, and between them a dead connection is still noticed in minutes:
//
//   - responseHeaderTimeout, on the streaming transport, catches a provider that
//     accepts the connection and never answers. It applies only to the streaming
//     transport, because for a non-streamed completion the response headers do
//     not arrive until the whole answer has been generated — putting a header
//     deadline there would reintroduce the very cutoff being removed.
//   - streamIdleTimeout, an idle watchdog on the body, catches a stream that
//     stops mid-answer. Any byte counts as progress, including the SSE keepalive
//     comments providers send while a reasoning model is still thinking, so a
//     long silent think is only a stall if nothing at all comes down the wire.

// ── THE POOL'S OWN TABLE: ONE VALUE, ONE REASON, ONE MEASUREMENT ────────────
//
// EVERY NUMBER HERE IS THIS BUILD'S ANSWER AND NOT THE STANDARD LIBRARY'S.
// `http.DefaultTransport` is a sensible default for a program nobody measured;
// it was measured here, and one of its answers was costing a person a TLS
// handshake every time they stopped to read. A value inherited silently is a
// decision nobody took, so each of the five below is set on purpose and says
// why, and [TestTheSharedTransportStatesEveryValueItRelieson] fails the build
// if one of them goes back to being inherited.
//
// ── THE MEASUREMENT, 2026-09-11, against the live router from the Spark ─────
//
// A connection was opened, held idle for a fixed interval, and used again with
// `httptrace` watching `GotConn`. Each hold had a pool of its own, so the only
// thing under test was the far end.
//
//	hold    keep-alive   rode the same socket
//	30s     none         yes
//	2m      none         yes
//	5m      none         yes
//	6m      none         yes
//	7m      none         NO — DNS 3ms, connect 3ms, TLS 9ms
//	8m      none         NO
//	9m      none         NO
//	15m     PING every 2m   yes
//	20m     PING every 2m   yes
//
// TWO FACTS COME OUT OF IT AND BOTH ARE USED BELOW. The router's own idle
// window is between six and seven minutes — so ninety seconds was throwing
// away a connection the far end was still holding, four times over. And an
// HTTP/2 PING keeps it open for as long as we care to: fifteen and twenty
// minutes of silence both rode the same socket.
//
//   - idleConnTimeout is how long THIS END keeps a connection nobody is using,
//     and it is the far end's own measured figure. Adopting the router's answer
//     rather than inventing one means neither end is guessing: inside the window
//     the router itself considers a connection live, a pause costs nothing;
//     past it, a pause costs one handshake, which is what a connection nobody
//     believes in any more is worth. The default was 90 seconds, which is
//     shorter than a person reads for — so someone who took two minutes over an
//     answer and then typed again paid DNS, TCP and TLS inside the next
//     request's own `httpClient.Do`, invisibly, because `ttft_ms` cannot tell a
//     handshake from a slow model (conntrace.go is what tells them apart now).
//   - http2KeepAlive is what stops the far end closing first INSIDE that
//     window. The window is known to be between six and seven minutes and not
//     to the second, so a pool that simply waited out its own six would
//     sometimes hand a request a socket the router had already dropped — a
//     failure, which is the expensive way to learn the same thing. At least two
//     pings must therefore land inside the shortest window the measurement
//     proves, which puts the period at no more than three minutes; two is the
//     figure the fifteen- and twenty-minute readings confirm. It is also the
//     health check that closes a socket whose ping goes unanswered, which is
//     what makes a pool held for minutes safe on a laptop that slept.
//   - forceAttemptHTTP2 is why a warm pool is cheap at all against the router:
//     one connection carries every request this process makes, so the pool that
//     matters is one socket rather than [limiterCeiling] of them — and it is
//     what makes the ping above possible, since HTTP/1.1 has no such frame. It
//     is on in the standard library's default and off in a transport somebody
//     built by hand, which is exactly the accident this states out loud.
//   - tlsHandshakeTimeout bounds the part of a cold connection this file exists
//     to stop paying for. Ten seconds is the standard library's figure and it
//     is far too long for a handshake that is going to work — the measured ones
//     above are nine to eleven MILLISECONDS. A lane that has not finished one
//     in this long is a path to somewhere else, and the ladder above has
//     somewhere else to go (dispatch.go).
//   - expectContinueTimeout is stated to say that it never applies: nothing in
//     this package sends `Expect: 100-continue`, so the wait it bounds is a
//     wait no request of ours takes. It is kept at a second rather than
//     disabled because a zero here means "wait forever" for the one request
//     that might one day carry the header through a proxy at CODEAF_BASE_URL.

	// standard library's fifteen seconds arrived at by default.
