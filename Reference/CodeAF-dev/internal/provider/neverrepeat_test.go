//
// The census (docs/design/recovery/census-20260910.md) counted 226 of 428
// multi-attempt chains that never left the lane they started on, and three that
// spent sixteen and seventeen consecutive sends on one machine over eleven
// minutes. Every one of those was this transport re-sending bytes it had
// encoded once, above the attempt loop, with the same `provider.order` on them.
//
// These scenarios are the law from the other side: what a person gets is an
// answer from a machine that had not refused yet, and what the wire gets is a
// different request every time.

// poolHandler is a fake router that answers by the preference it is given and
// records what it was asked. It is deliberately not lanestub: these scenarios
// are about the BYTES of each attempt, so the handler keeps the body of every
// request beside the lane it chose, which is the pairing the law is about.
