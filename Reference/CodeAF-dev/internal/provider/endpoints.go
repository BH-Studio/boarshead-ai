// ── THE ENDPOINT REFUSAL CHAIN ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// "No endpoints found that can handle the requested parameters" is the router
// saying something no other 4xx says: the MODEL is fine, the KEY is fine, the
// conversation is fine — the combination of optional fields on this particular
// request matches none of the endpoints serving it. Nothing about that is a
// mistake a person made, and until this file the only thing they were handed
// was the sentence itself, on a turn that produced no answer.
//
// It is a shape this adapter can very often fix by itself, because it is the
// one that put most of those fields there. Four of the five things that can
// narrow the endpoint set to empty are the adapter's own economies rather than
// anything the caller asked for:
//
//   - `provider.require_parameters: true`, sent on EVERY OpenRouter request
//     (velocity.go), which turns every other field on the body into a hard
//     endpoint filter — including the tool definitions the belt always carries;
//   - `provider.ignore`, the velocity ledger's refusals, which on a model with
//     two endpoints can remove both;
//   - the `reasoning` knob, which a person set once with ctrl+t and which no
//     longer fits the model they have since switched to;
//   - an output cap or a structured-output schema a particular endpoint does
//     not publish.
//
// So the chain below takes them back off, one at a time, cheapest first, and
// SAYS SO EACH TIME. A retry that silently changed the shape of the request
// would be an adapter answering a different question from the one it was asked;
// a person watching "Retry 2/4: removed reasoning" knows exactly what they got
// and exactly what to change to keep it.
//
// WHAT ENTERS THE LADDER. Only this error class does, and only after a watched
// request has no serving, untried lane the purse will fund. A timeout, a 5xx, a
// 429 and a plain 404 from a wrong base URL all keep the behaviour they had
// (retry.go), because none of them is a claim about the request's shape and
// stripping fields off them would spend a person's turn discovering that.
//
// ── HOW THE CLASS IS RECOGNISED: BY STRUCTURE, NEVER BY VOCABULARY ──────────
//
// A list of the sentences a router has been SEEN to refuse in is always one
// sentence behind, and on 2026-08-28 it was. The ladder's price rung IS the
// recovery for a price ceiling that emptied the endpoint set, and it never
// fired for a whole headless run, because the router reports the LAST filter
// that emptied the set — "no endpoints available matching your guardrail
// restrictions and data policy" — rather than the price that did it. Adding
// that sentence to the list bought exactly one more sentence of coverage; the
// next unfamiliar phrasing is the same outage again. Rule 1 of
// docs/design/failsafe/FAILSAFE.md is the general form of that lesson: a
// fail-safe detects by STRUCTURE or it is decoration.
//
// The structural facts are all available without reading a word of the message:
//
//   - the status is 404 or 400 ([endpointRefusalStatus]);
//   - the body is the ROUTER'S OWN JSON error envelope — an `error` object with
//     a `message` in it ([routerErrorEnvelope]) — which is what a wrong base URL
//     CANNOT produce: a proxy, a static host, a mistyped path and a plain nginx
//     all answer in HTML or bare text, and none of them has an envelope to
//     answer in;
//   - the request went to a base that has SHOWN it serves several endpoints
//     behind a model ([Client.baseServesLanes] — the endpoints page it
//     answered, never its hostname), because this
//     whole ladder is about which of several endpoints may serve one model, and
//     a single endpoint has no endpoint set that can be emptied;
//   - the model is one the CATALOG KNOWS ([Client.catalogKnowsModel]), which is
//     what separates "nothing can serve this shape" from "there is no such
//     model". The second is a fact the caller has to be SHOWN, and negotiating
//     with it would spend four attempts discovering a typo;
//   - and the router refused on its OWN account rather than relaying somebody
//     else's ([APIError.FromUpstream] reads the same field). A 400 forwarded
//     from the endpoint the router chose is ONE endpoint's verdict on the
//     request — the routing layer found something to try, which is the opposite
//     of this class, and refusal_test.go's rotation is the answer to it.
//
// Under all five, a 404 cannot be a wrong base URL and cannot be an unknown
// model. What is left is "nothing I can reach will serve this shape", and the
// ladder is the right answer to it whatever sentence it arrived in.
//
// [endpointRefusalPhrases] survives as a HINT with one job and no authority:
// it SHORT-CIRCUITS the classification when it matches, so every refusal the
// old gate caught is still caught — including on endpoints where the structural
// facts cannot be established at all.

// endpointRefusalStatus is the status half of the gate. 404 is the router's own
// spelling of "nothing can serve this"; 400 is what several OpenAI-compatible
// gateways answer with instead. It is necessary and never sufficient — the rest
// of what makes a refusal this class is in [Client.routingRefusal].

	return status == http.StatusNotFound || status == http.StatusBadRequest

	// 1.25, and for deepseek-v4-pro that admits exactly ONE endpoint — the
	// first-party one at list price; every reseller is 1.7× to 2.2× above it.
	// When the account's privacy setting excludes that one endpoint, the ceiling
	// leaves nothing, and the router does not say "no endpoints found that
	// satisfy the max price" — it reports the LAST filter that emptied the set,

	// said "not this class", the plain-404 path resent the identical body, and
	// the ladder that drops the ceiling on its price rung never fired. The proof

//
// It used to. This ladder walked [Client.fallbackChain] after its relaxation
// rungs, and internal/session's turn loop walks the SAME chain when a model's
// transport budget is spent — two mechanisms drawing from one list, neither
// knowing the other had already tried a model. A turn could pay for the same
// fallback twice, and the session's `nextFallback` indexed the list blind: it
// counted its OWN hops and read `options[len(hopped)]`, so a chain the adapter
// had already walked was re-walked from the top.
//
// ONE MODEL HOP, AND IT BELONGS TO THE SESSION (docs/design/recovery §4, "what
// the session keeps"). The adapter owns the request's SHAPE — which machine,
// which knobs, which ceiling — and hands back a refusal naming what it tried; the
// layer that owns the turn decides whether a different model is worth asking,
// because it is the only layer that knows what the turn has already spent and
// what the person asked for. What the adapter still owes is the FACT: every
// model it put on the wire is recorded on the call's own context
// ([ModelsTried]), so the session's hop reads what was tried instead of counting.
//
// The relaxation rungs stay exactly where they were. They are about the request
// and nobody above this layer can compose one.

// THE LADDER ITSELF IS THE DISPATCHER'S (dispatch.go's
// [Client.recoverFromRefusal]). What stays here is the DATA it climbs — which
// rungs this request has, in which order, spelled how — because that is a fact
// about the request's shape and the encoder is the only layer that knows it. The
// walk moved because a second loop counting its own rungs is a second budget,
// which is the shape docs/design/recovery/DESIGN.md §4 deleted: the rungs reach
// [control.Next] as [control.Plan.Shapes] and come back one at a time.

// widenPastTheUncarriedPreference is the ONE retry that finds out whether a
// base's 400 was about the `provider` field at all — and it is the ANSWER to

//
// THE RETRY IS THE TEST, AND IT IS THE TEST BECAUSE NO READING OF THE WORDS IS
// ONE. `Unrecognized request argument supplied: provider` and `invalid provider
// name` are both 400s that name the field and they mean opposite things, so a
// phrase list here would mark a base as refusing preferences for good over one
// bad lane name (prefcarry.go's [prefRefused] states the whole of that
// argument). Sending the identical request with the object taken off settles it
// structurally: if that lands, the object was the difference; if it fails too,
// the object was not.
//
// AND A FAILURE TEACHES NOTHING, WHICH IS THE HALF THAT MATTERS. The base's
// answer stays unasked, so the next request carries the preference again and the
// person is told nothing — because nothing was established. What they get back
// is the second refusal, whole, which is the honest thing to hand a caller whose
// request could not be served either way.

// (retry.go's outOfPatience) — and when that is spent the call has a choice
// between an error and another model.
//

// see, while internal/session's turn loop walked the same list for the same
// reason — the second of the two model-hop mechanisms docs/design/recovery §2.2
// counts. The paced error now travels back whole: the boundary reads it as the
// wire ([taxonomy.Transport]), the turn spends its own budget on it, and if that
// budget runs out the ONE model hop in this build takes it to the next model,
// knowing what has already been tried ([ModelsTried]).
