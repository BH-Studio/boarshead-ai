// ── THE RUNG IS A MOVE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// docs/design/recovery/DESIGN.md §4's last un-folded loop. The ladder walked
// `relaxationPlan` itself until 2026-09-11 — a private length, under a deadline
// that could not see it, beside a move generator that already knew the rungs —
// and what it does now is ask [control.Next] for its rung like every other move.
// These scenarios are what that has to mean: the same rungs in the same order on
// the wire, ONE history under them, and the plan's deadline over them.

// watchedPlan installs a controller that keeps the plan every arm is built with,
// which is the only way outside this race to read the log an arm is writing —
// and the log is the claim under test.
