// ── A PIN THAT GOES QUIET ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A person who names a machine has said something, and the two ways of ignoring
// them are both wrong: going somewhere else without asking answers a question
// nobody put, and waiting forever on a machine that has gone quiet is the
// reported defect. So the wait becomes one sentence, and the sentence is
// answerable — unless there is nobody there to answer it, in which case the
// answer is to get them their answer and write down what was done.
//
// The controller's arithmetic is identical for a pinned lane and an unpinned
// one; the whole difference is the ACT, which is what these tests are about.

// pinnedChoice is what a strict pin looks like once it reaches the transport:
// the machine the person named, and the frontier the offer would point at.
//
// A PIN THAT CARRIES NO FRONTIER CAN NEVER RAISE AN OFFER, because there is
// nowhere for a `y` to go — the request would report the wait and nothing else.
// That is a fact about `internal/lane`'s chooser rather than about this file,
// and it is why the pin's own row is written with both.
// AND IT SAYS SO IN THE FIELD THAT MEANS IT. `Only` is what a demand and a pin
// have in common — every routed call demands the set the chooser admitted — and
// [lanes.Choice.Pinned] is what only a pin has: a person's own word, which is
// what turns the act from a rescue into a question.
