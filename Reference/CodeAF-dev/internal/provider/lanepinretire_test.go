// ── THE PIN THE WIRE HAS ALREADY REFUSED ────────────────────────────────────
//
// Issue #456. What is asserted here is the whole of the policy, and it is
// asserted against a real refusal on a real wire: the stub publishes a machine
// on its endpoints page and will not serve it, answering with the router's own
// `…but your request's provider.only preference permits only: …`, which is the
// one refusal class that is certain about a pairing.
//
// The behaviour it replaces: the demand was re-sent on EVERY request, so every
// turn of a session paid a 404 round trip to be told a fact this process had
// already been told — and on the turn's own unhedged call, with nothing to walk
// to, the turn ended and the person read the router's sentence.

// retiredLanes is the scenario: one machine the sheet publishes and the wire
// refuses, and two that answer.
