// ── THE WIRE, WITH SOMEBODY ELSE HOLDING THE BELIEF FILE (issue #264) ───────
//
// The scenarios in hedge_test.go script a ledger, which is what makes them
// about the watch. These two are about the opposite thing: the REAL ledger,
// writing a real file, with the file's lock held by somebody who is not going
// to give it back — and the claim is that the wire does not notice.
//
// It is the incident of 2026-09-01 reduced to a test. That process sent nothing
// at all for 29m49s because a belief write took an exclusive flock while
// holding the mutex every encode reads.

// wireBound is how long a turn may take while the belief file's lock is held
// elsewhere. The lanes below answer in milliseconds, so what this really
// separates is a turn that happens from one that never comes back.
const wireBound = 5 * time.Second

// heldBeliefFile takes the real belief file's gate exclusively, as another
// codeaf mid-compaction holds it, for the rest of the test.
//
// The path is the one a shipped binary uses, resolved under the temporary home
// the rig has already installed — a test that locked the real one would freeze
// whoever is running the suite.
