// ── ONE CHOICE PER CALL, STREAMED OR NOT ────────────────────────────────────
//
// A lane choice is a SAMPLED decision — `internal/lane`'s seed mixes in the
// moment it is asked at — and one call encodes its request many times: once per
// attempt, once for each rung of the relaxation ladder, once more for the
// object the refusal door re-derives. While the encoder was free to draw one of
// its own, each of those encodes could be a different request to a different set
// of machines, and nothing above the encoder could name the set: the plan reads
// the call's choice ([requestSet]) and a choice the encoder kept to itself left
// the move generator walking a set the wire had never carried.
//
// BOTH SCENARIOS BELOW STAGE ONE FACT: THE BELIEF ARRIVES WHILE THE CALL IS IN
// FLIGHT. That is not a contrivance — it is the ordinary life of a call. The
// lane beat primes the ledger from the endpoints page on its own clock, and the
// call's own refusals are written into the belief as they happen
// (lanes.go's noteLaneRefused). A call that began knowing nothing about a model
// therefore very often knows something about it two attempts later, and the
// question this file settles is whether that changes the request already in
// flight. It must not: the watch, the plan and the body agree because there is
// ONE choice, drawn once, at the top of the call.

// movingLedger is a ledger that learns two lanes WHILE A CALL IS RUNNING. Cold
// it holds one belief, which is nothing to rank (internal/lane refuses to make
// a choice out of fewer than two); warm it holds three, which is a ranking.
//
// It is warmed by [warmingTransport] — the call's first request leaving — and
// not after a counted number of reads, because a read count is a claim about how
// many times the code under test happens to compose a preference object, which
// is the thing these scenarios must not depend on.
