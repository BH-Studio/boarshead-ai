// Issue #433. What is asserted here is the whole of the law, and every one of
// these scenarios runs against a PLAIN LOOPBACK ADDRESS with a model spelled
// like anybody's model: no `openrouter.ai` in the URL and no `openrouter/` on
// the id. Both of those used to be load-bearing — they were how this build
// decided whether a routing preference went on the wire at all — and a test
// that still wore either would be asserting against the costume rather than
// against the product.
//
// The behaviour they replace: on a proxy, a mirror, a self-hosted router or the
// shipped router reached by its IP, a person could rank lanes, pin one, and
// watch `pinned: X` go on standing in the settings panel while every request
// went out as `auto`. Nothing errored and nothing logged.

// here rather than inline so that a reader cannot mistake it for an incidental
// choice: the spelling IS the assertion.
