// all. Not a sort word, not the ledger's order, not a price ceiling, not the
// endpoint that answered last time. Whatever this process believes about the
// machines behind the model, none of it is asked for, and OpenRouter's own
// default routing answers.
//
// It is written against a client built by hand rather than through
// [rankedRoad], because every other fixture in this package says which road it
// is about and this one is about saying nothing at all.
