// ── WHAT IS THE ANSWER AND WHAT IS THE WORKING ──────────────────────────────
//
// THIS FILE IS THE ONE PLACE THAT DECIDES, and it decides with the wire in
// hand. Everything above it — the session's transcript, the surface's answer
// block, the thought window that collapses to `thought for 6s` — reads the
// decision and never re-takes it, because a second reader is a second opinion
// and the two disagreeing is the whole of #225: a reply drawn as thinking, a
// turn that looks like it never answered, a `<think>` tag typed into the
// person's answer as though the model had meant to write it.
//
// THREE FACTS ABOUT THE WIRE FORCE THE SHAPE, and none of them is about any
// particular model:
//
//  1. AN ENDPOINT MAY SPLIT THE CHANNELS. `content` is the answer and
//     `reasoning` / `reasoning_content` / `reasoning_text` is the working
//     (sse.go's [streamDelta]). This is the ordinary case and nothing here
//     disturbs it.
//
//  2. AN ENDPOINT MAY NOT SPLIT THEM, and then the working arrives INSIDE
//     `content`, fenced in a `<think>` tag the endpoint never stripped. It is
//     the shape every OpenAI-compatible gateway in front of a raw open model
//     produces — vLLM, llama.cpp, Ollama, LM Studio, anything reached through
//     CODEAF_BASE_URL — and until this file existed the tag and the model's
//     private working were typed into the answer and recorded in the
//     transcript as words the model had said out loud.
//
//  3. AN ENDPOINT MAY PUT THE WHOLE REPLY ON THE REASONING CHANNEL AND SEND NO
//     CONTENT AT ALL. Measured on 2026-09-01 against the real router:
//     `qwen/qwen3.5-9b` answered a two-sentence question with zero content
//     deltas and 3,066 characters of `reasoning`, and one call inside a live
//     `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` conversation did the same with 76 reasoning
//     deltas and no content. A response like that is not a model that declined
//     to answer — the answer is sitting in the working — and reading it as an
//     empty reply is how a turn ends up costing money, retrying, and telling
//     the person nothing (internal/session's [turnBroke]).
//
// THE DECISION IS MADE ONCE AND SPENT TWICE, which is the property that makes
// the live drawing and the recorded message agree by construction: the same
// [answerSplit] feeds the observer that the surface draws from AND the
// accumulated `content` that becomes the assistant message. A replay cannot
// show something streaming did not, because there is only one account of it.
//
// NOTHING HERE KNOWS A MODEL'S NAME. The rules are about the SHAPE of what
// arrived — a fenced region at the head of the answer, an answer that is empty
// when the stream ends — for the reason every other law in this package is
// shape-based: a table of model names is a table that is wrong the week after
// it is written.

// thinkTags are the wire spellings of a working region fenced inside the answer
// channel. It is a list of WIRE SPELLINGS and not a list of models, in exactly
// the sense [streamDelta]'s three reasoning field names are: an endpoint uses
// one of them consistently, and holding all of them is what makes an unfamiliar
// gateway lossless rather than mangled.

// strip its own template; a model that writes `<think>` in the fourth paragraph

// QUESTION, and the promotion is only ever right for the first.
//
// The turn's reply is read by a person: if the whole of it came back in the
// working, the working is the reply and handing it over is the only honest
// thing to do. A gate is the other kind — it asks for `{"work": false}` and its
// answer is read by a parser (internal/session's route_judge.go, checkpoint.go)
// — and there, a model that deliberated in its working and never wrote the
// object did NOT answer. Promoting a deliberation into that slot hands the
// parser a draft to salvage a verdict out of, which is a task started off a
// sentence the model was still arguing with itself about. Measured on the real
// router on 2026-09-01, roughly one gate call in ten comes back with an empty
// answer and a full working, so this is not a corner.
//
// SO THE CALLER SAYS WHICH KIND ITS CALL IS, in the same way it already says
// who is waiting on it ([WithRoutingIntent]) and what it is for
// ([WithCallTag]): facts about the CALL, stated by the code making it, never
// guessed from the words that come back. The default is off, because a value
// slot filled with prose is the worse failure.

// input exactly as it is junk in a person's answer, so nothing gates that half.
