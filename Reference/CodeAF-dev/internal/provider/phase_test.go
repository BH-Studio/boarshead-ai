// never told two things at once and never told nothing at all. These tests are
// the claim, scenario by scenario, against the fake router: a healthy stream
// walks connecting → first word → thinking → writing and stops; a stream that
// stalls inside its thinking shows the countdown and then the switch, on ONE
// request's worth of extra spending; and a stream with nowhere to go shows the
// phase and the clock and promises nothing.

// heard collects the phase story in the order it was told.
