// ── THE WALL KEEPS WHAT WAS THOUGHT (issue #927) ─────────────────────────────
//
// A structuring call on a reasoning model thought for its whole four-minute
// wall, was cut, and handed its caller nothing: every token it had reasoned was
// billed and thrown away, and the command that asked for it struck twice and
// told the person the model had stopped answering. These are that call, at the
// scale a test can run: the wall is tens of milliseconds, the model is a stub
// that streams its thought through the same observer door the provider does,
// and nothing here sleeps — the only clock is the wall's own.

// thoughtWall is the wall these scenarios run under. Nothing waits it out except
// a completion that is meant to reach it. The answer ask runs under it too, and
// cannot lose a race to it: the stub answers that ask before anything reads a
// clock, and a completion that returns an answer is kept whatever its timer says.

	// deadline, read at the door.
	left time.Duration
}

// thinkingModel is the model from the incident: it thinks, out loud on the
// stream, and does not stop until its context does. When `answer` is set it is
// what the model says to a request that tells it to stop thinking — the answer
// ask — and when it is empty the model thinks through that one too.
