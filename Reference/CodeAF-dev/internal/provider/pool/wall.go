// DefaultCallWall is how long one structuring completion may take before the
// system stops waiting on it.
//
// FOUR MINUTES IS A MEASURED FIGURE NOW, AND IT IS SHOWN TO THE MODEL. It used to
// be argued as "deliberately far past honest", on production rows where the
// slowest structuring call was under a minute. Issue #927 measured otherwise on
// a reasoning model with a long request: an honest compile of 225 seconds and
// spine passes of 53 to 165, beside a grounding pass that thought for the whole
// four minutes on one machine and answered in two seconds on another. So the
// wall is no longer only a line past which a completion is gone. It is the time
// the completion is TOLD it has: every walled request carries it to the effort
// ladder, which derives the thinking budget the model is given from it
// (provider's [provider.WithThinkingWall]), and a completion that still reaches
// it with thought on the wire is asked for its answer rather than thrown away
// ([walled.CompleteWithMessages]).
//
// The unit matters. This bounds ONE completion, not one command and not one
// agent loop: a head turn that makes nine tool calls gets nine fresh walls, and
// a leaf that thinks for an hour across forty round-trips is never touched by
// it. Bounding the call rather than the caller is what lets the number be small
// enough to catch a hang without ever cutting honest work in half.
//
// The incident it exists for: a contract call on a chat splice never returned.
// There was no deadline anywhere on the path — not on the context, not on the
// client, not on the transport for a streamed request — so the reconciler's
// command queue stopped forever behind one open socket while the process went
// on looking alive.
const DefaultCallWall = 4 * time.Minute

// completionsPerCall is how many completions one walled call may make: the one
// it was asked for, and — when that one reached its wall with thought on the
// wire — the one ask for the answer the thought reached. It is the count
// [LongestCall] multiplies and the count [walled.allowance] divides a short
// caller's time by, so the rail above and the split below are one figure.
const completionsPerCall = 2

// LongestCall is the longest one call through a slot walled at [DefaultCallWall]
// can honestly take: the completion it was asked for, cut at its wall, and the
// one ask for the answer that completion's thought had reached, under a wall of
// its own. It is exported for the reconciler's command rail, which is counted in
// these (internal/resident's commandWall) so that the two figures cannot drift.

// ErrCallWall is what a call that outlived its wall returns. It is an ordinary
// provider failure by design: every caller on the structuring path already has
// an error branch, and this arrives on it rather than inventing a new one. The
// layer above owns the retry — this layer refuses to wait forever and keeps
// what was thought ([walled.CompleteWithMessages]), and a call that returns this
// is one whose answer ask ran out of time as well.
//
// THE SENTENCE IS THE CAUSE. Silence never reaches this wall: a stream that stops
// writing is cut by the stream guard's own silence bounds long before four
// minutes, with a sentence of its own. What reaches it is a model still WORKING
// — in every row issue #927 measured, still thinking — so "stopped answering",
// which this said until then, was the one account of the event that was false.
//
// It wraps context.DeadlineExceeded deliberately. A stall has to be legible to
// the reconciler's watchdog, which decides between striking a command and
// failing it, and the alternative was for internal/resident to import this
// package for one sentinel. Wrapping the standard error instead means the
// watchdog asks the only question it actually has — "did this die of time?" —
// with errors.Is.

// every first token had arrived in under a second. The same falsehood has two
// other spellings on the structuring road, and they are worse because they are
// machinery: a planning stage that ends on a clock reaches the person as
// `context deadline exceeded`, inside "the plan for task-2 was drawn with

// IT KEEPS THE PLACE AND REPLACES THE JARGON. "size stage 1: context deadline
// exceeded" becomes "size stage 1: the model thought past its time", because
// which pass ran out is information the person's next decision uses, while

//   - THE WALL KEEPS WHAT WAS THOUGHT — WHICHEVER CLOCK CUT IT. What streams is
//     kept as it arrives ([kept]). A completion that ends on a clock with thought
//     or answer on the wire is not thrown away: the model is asked ONCE more, on
//     the same lineage, with what it had worked out in front of it and its
//     thinking switched off, for the answer that work reached. The wall is not
//     the only clock over a completion — the dispatcher gives an attempt its own
//     patience and the stream guard bounds a quiet stream, and issue #927's
//     second run lost its size, bind and contract passes to one of those at 51
//     seconds, not to the four-minute wall — so what the salvage asks is whether
//     TIME ended this completion, never which timer did. Only when the answer ask
//     runs out too, or when nothing had arrived at all, does the caller get an
//     error, and it is the one its own cut named ([ErrCallWall] for the wall's).
//   - THE CALLER'S OWN CANCEL IS NEVER A PROVIDER FAILURE. A caller who went away
//     gets their own context error back untouched, and nothing is asked again.
//
// The answer ask is not a retry. A retry is the same bytes to another machine
