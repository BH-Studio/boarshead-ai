// (internal/lane/lanestub) and asserts on what a watcher was told. A unit test
// over [callProgress] alone would prove the coalescing and nothing about the

// token and the ending all come from places in this package that a fake would
// have to re-implement to stand in for.

// progressLog is a watcher that keeps what it was told, which is all a watcher
// on this seam is allowed to do (callprogress.go's no-work law).
