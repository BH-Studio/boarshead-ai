// ── THE RACE: THE TRANSPORT HALF OF THE CONTROLLER ──────────────────────────
//
// `internal/lane/control` says WHEN a wait has gone on long enough to act on.
// This file is what happens next: another request to another lane, on a child
// context, with the first arm to earn the answer keeping it and the others
// cancelled — because cancelling is what stops the bill on the twenty-odd lanes
// that honour it.
//
// FIVE RULES HOLD THE WHOLE THING TOGETHER.
//
//  1. EVERY TOKEN-GENERATING CALL IS WATCHED. Not the calls the router had an
//     opinion about — every one. A cold ledger has no opinion, which is the
//     state of every model somebody picks after launch, and it is the case that
//     most needs a clock: the reported defect was a three-minute wait with
//     nothing watching it because the race refused a choice that named no
//     alternative. A call with nowhere to go still has a ceiling, still reports
//     and still writes down what it did.
//  2. MANY ARMS, ONE PURSE. A question may become more than two requests. What
//     bounds it is money — THIS CALL'S OWN ([control.Plan.SpendUSD], asked
//     through [hedgeRace.affordsLocked] before every arm) — and [maxArms] as the
//     absolute cap on one question, never a boolean that says a rescue has
//     already been spent. It was a rolling process-wide allowance until
//     2026-09-11 and that is the shape the purse must never take again: a count
//     spread over twenty requests refuses by arrival order.
//  3. THE PERSON HEARS ONE VOICE. Every arm streams, and one of them is ever
//     the SPEAKER. The others' deltas are held, and are replayed only if one of
//     them wins — after a plain notice, because text that was on the screen and
//     is being replaced is something a person must be told about rather than
//     left to notice.
//  4. A PIN IS ASKED, NEVER OVERRIDDEN. Where an unpinned call hedges, a pinned
//     one raises the offer in offer.go — and with nobody to ask, it borrows
//     once and says so.
//  5. A HEDGE IS A MEASUREMENT. Every arm is folded back into the ledger
//     whichever way the race went, with one exception: an act taken when
//     NOTHING at all had arrived charges nothing to the lane's belief, because
//     nothing about that lane was ever observed.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE, DELIBERATELY. The continuation hedge — carrying the partial
// answer to the alternative as a prefill so it continues rather than restarts —
// is out of this version. It is safe only for plain text (a tool call split
// across two lanes is a bug), it needs a runtime check that the continuation
// does not repeat the partial, and it changes what the person reads.
// [hedgeRace.flip] is the seam it would land at.

// maxArms is how many requests one question may ever become: the original and
// three rescues.
//
// IT IS THE LADDER'S SECOND RUNG, BOUNDED. A stall is answered by asking
// another lane; a rescue that is itself refused walks to the next gate-passing
// lane in frontier order, because a lane refusing a request is a fact about
// that lane and not about the model — and relaxing the request, or changing the
// model, before the model's own remaining machines have been tried is answering
// a different question from the one somebody asked (the ladder, in
// docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). Four is where it stops: past three failed lanes the
// evidence is about the model or the request rather than about the endpoints,
// and every step of the walk is budgeted besides.
//
// ── IT IS NOT A RETRY BUDGET AND MUST NOT BE FOLDED INTO THE DEADLINE ───────
//
// Every other count on this path went when the plan's one deadline arrived
// (docs/design/recovery/DESIGN.md §4), and this one deliberately stayed, so here
// is the difference in one sentence: those counted how many times a question may
// be ASKED AGAIN, and this bounds how many copies of it may be in flight AT
// ONCE. A hedge is Dean & Barroso's tail-at-scale rescue — a second request
// started while the first is still alive, paid for out of a purse — so what
// bounds it is money and concurrency, not patience. Folding it into the deadline
// would let one slow answer become as many simultaneous paid requests as ninety
// seconds can start, which is the traffic an account-wide rate limit is made of.
// The arms share the deadline over them and the move log under them; what they
// do not share is a retry count, because they are not retries.
const maxArms = 4

// heldEvents bounds what is remembered for an arm that is not speaking. A
// silent arm takes the voice the moment it writes a word a person can read, so
// this is reached only when the race has stopped making progress at all; past
// it the person loses some replayed text and never the answer, which is the
// right way round.
const heldEvents = 512

// hedgeNotice is the line a replacement carries when an answer changes providers
// mid-flow. It is shown only when there was text on the screen to replace: a
// rescue that fires before the first token replaces nothing and says nothing.
const hedgeNotice = "that provider went quiet — this answer is coming from another one"

// firstPromptNotice is the missing half of that silence. A first prompt has
// nothing on the screen yet, so [hedgeNotice] never fires, and a stall sat
// through the ninety-second first-token cut with no door named (F42). `/model`
// is the switch a person would otherwise have to discover.
const firstPromptNotice = "still no answer — trying another provider · /model switches"

// A wait without another request must not claim a rescue or draw switching.
const firstPromptWaitNotice = "still waiting for an answer · /model switches"

// waitNow is the clock the waiting controller runs on, and it is deliberately
// NOT the client's seamed [Client.clock].
//
// That seam exists so a test can state a two-second first token without waiting
// two seconds, and what it usually holds is a scripted list of instants. The
// controller is not a measurement: it is an account of how long a PERSON has
// been waiting, and a policy that read a scripted clock would decide the shape
// of a wait nobody was having — while spending, out of the read loop, the ticks
// a measurement under test was counting. This is the same argument
// [logNow] makes about the model-call log, and the two are deliberately the
// same shape.

// EVERY MILLISECOND SPENT HERE IS A MILLISECOND THE PERSON SPENDS WATCHING
// NOTHING MOVE.
//
// It used to spend up to a second of it, draining the arms and withdrawing the
// offer before answering the caller. Both of those are about the race that is
// ENDING, and nothing the next request needs is in either: the drain exists so
// the call log has no start row without an end row under it, and the withdrawal
// gives an offer token back. So they happen where they belong — behind the

// stay here rather than ride along with the drain. Every call posts an empty
// phase as it unwinds (client.go's deferred [phaseClock.done]), and an empty
// phase is how a surface is told to forget the row (internal/tui3's phase.go).
// A withdrawal posted from behind this return would arrive AFTER that one, up to

//
// The door used to ask two questions in two calls: `canWalk()`, a PREDICTION
// that the walk would carry this refusal, and then `deferLadder(body)`, a note
// recording that it had relied on one. Between them the race could have found a
// winner, struck the lane the prediction was about, or spent the purse — and
// even when it had not, the prediction was about the WALK, which answers only
// the refusals that reach this door. On 2026-09-10 three arms died: two doors
// predicted a walk and deferred, and the third arm died of a 429, which is not a
// routing refusal and reaches no door at all. The ladder two doors had deferred
// was run by nobody and the person read the router's own 404.
//
// ── WHAT IT COMMITS TO ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE RACE OWNS THIS REFUSAL UNTIL IT IS ANSWERED OR THE QUESTION IS SPENT. Not
// "the walk will carry it" — the race makes no claim about which of its moves
// will — but that it will make them: the walk when an arm's failure reaches the
// loop, and, if every arm ends with nobody committed, the ladder this call just
// took ([hedgeRace.exhausted], which is now the FULFILMENT of this promise
// rather than a repair of a wrong guess).
//
// ── THE WHOLE DECISION HAPPENS UNDER ONE LOCK ───────────────────────────────
//
// The question this asks is the same one `canWalk` asked — is there an untried,
// serving, affordable machine left — and that question was never the defect. The
// defect was that the ANSWER and the RECORD were two calls: the race could find a
// winner, strike the lane, or spend the purse between them, and the note written
// second said the first one had been relied on whether or not it was still true.
// So the answer and the record are taken together here, and a door that is told
// yes is a door whose refusal the race has already taken.
//
// A DOOR TOLD NO CLIMBS THE LADDER ITSELF, and that is the better of the two
// rather than a consolation: it holds the shape of the request that has just been
// refused, where the race holds only the body. The last arm of the measured
// ceiling race demands one machine and no ceiling; its own door drops that demand
// on rung one and is answered, where a ladder restarted from the primary's capped
// body pays an extra rung to arrive at the same place.
//
// AND THE PROMISE IS KEPT WHEN NO DOOR COMES AT ALL. An arm can die of something
// that reaches no refusal door — the 2026-09-10 race's last arm died of a 429 —
// and then nobody would have climbed what this took. [hedgeRace.exhausted] is
// where the race keeps it, once every arm has ended with nobody committed. That
// is the difference from `canWalk`: this is a promise the race holds, not a guess
// a door made about somebody else's future.

//
// Three arms. The primary's door and the first rescue's door each saw a routing
// refusal, each asked [hedgeRace.canWalk], each heard yes — there was an
// untried, serving, affordable machine — and each handed its refusal to the
// walk instead of climbing the ladder. The third arm accepted, went silent and
// died of a 429, which is not a routing refusal and never reaches that door.
// So the ladder — relax the endpoint filter, let the router choose, drop the
// ceiling, then the fallback models — was deferred twice and run by nobody, and
// the race settled on the primary's 404. The person sent the same words again
// by hand, the door found nowhere to walk, climbed, and was answered at once.
//
// THE LAW: A LADDER A DOOR DEFERRED IS CLIMBED BEFORE THE QUESTION IS SETTLED.
// The walk, the ladder and the session's retry are three controllers, and the
// handoffs between them were predictions. This makes the one between the first
// two a guarantee: the race ends a question in an answer or in exhaustion, and

// door that climbed it itself and by this — and never on a dead context, where
// nothing is waiting for the answer.
//

// no prediction at all — it hands the refusal over and the race takes it — so
