// ── THE STALL NOBODY COULD BE RESCUED FROM ──────────────────────────────────
//
// THE DEFECT THESE PIN, as it was reported: "stuck in a state where in the
// middle of thinking it just says still working, but at the bottom I see
// glm 5.3 friendli and t/s". A reasoning model writes its thinking on the same
// stream as its answer, and the watch counted those deltas as tokens. Past
// sixty-four of them — about two sentences of thought — every hedge was
// refused, because the commitment rule asks whether finishing here is cheaper
// than starting again and answers "stay" whenever nobody said how long the
// answer would be (which nothing in this build ever did). So the stall was
// left to the transport's own guard: forty-five seconds, or a hundred and fifty
// under keepalives, with nothing on the screen but three dots.
//
// The rule now counts the tokens A PERSON CAN READ. A run of thought is money
// already spent and nothing anybody would watch disappear, so it buys no
// commitment at all and a stall inside it is hedged like any other.

// hundred deltas of thought, then silence, with a healthy lane beside it.
