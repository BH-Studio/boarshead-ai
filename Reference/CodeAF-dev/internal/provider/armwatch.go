// ── DRIVING ONE ARM'S CONTROLLER FROM THE READ LOOP ─────────────────────────

// streamWatch is what the read loop reports to: one arm's controller, the arm
// it belongs to, and the lock that makes it safe to drive from the loop and
// from the silence beat at the same time.
//
// It is the ONLY thing the read loop knows about waiting. Every hook in
// client.go is a nil-safe method call on this type, so a call with no
// controller installed pays one nil check per delta and nothing else.

	// the hazard's FIRST deadline — when this arm was going to start thinking
	// about a second machine — and the log has been recording it under a name
	// that reads as "when this call was going to be ended". The census of
	// 2026-09-10 measured what that costs: 2,720 of 11,841 finished attempts
	// ran more than twice their recorded `deadline_ms`, the field reads 10,000
	// on 7,937 rows, and the worst row is `deadline_ms 10000` against `ms
	// 937777`. Six hundred rows cut by a bound set OUTSIDE this package were
	// read by that census as the stream wall cutting live streams, which the
	// wall never did.
	//
	// SO THE TWO FACTS ARE SEPARATE FIELDS AND THE ROW MAY CARRY BOTH: what was
	// planned, and what happened. This pair is filled in by the guard when one
	// of its bounds fires ([stallWatch] through [streamWatch.boundApplied]) and

	// rows in the 2026-09-10 census, the single largest "cause family" in it,
	// and not one of them is a thing that went wrong: they are the price of a

// ── THE CEILING PICKS ONE OR THE OTHER, NEVER NEITHER ───────────────────────
//
// A hedge is the PAID way to act on a silence — a second request, priced against
// what this call may spend rescuing itself ([control.Plan.SpendUSD]). A cut is
// the FREE way: end this attempt and let the layer above ask another machine at
// once, paying the prompt again and nothing else.
//
// UNTIL THAT WAVE THE CEILING COULD CHOOSE NEITHER, and that is a hole rather
// than a trade-off. `docs/design/waiting/DESIGN.md` §A clause 1 says the role's
// ceiling is hard "regardless of belief"; it has to be hard regardless of what
// this call can afford too, or the clause means "regardless of belief, when we
// happen to be able to afford it". Measured on 2026-09-10: 2,186 attempts fired
// the ceiling, had the purse refuse the arm, and then had NOTHING act — 648 of
// them went on for more
// than six times the silence that had just been refused, to a ninety-ninth
// percentile of 272 seconds and a worst case of 938. Four quick tasks that
// evening waited on one machine for six and seven MINUTES before its first
// token, every one of them ten seconds past a ceiling that had already fired.
//
// BUT THE FREE MOVE IS NOT FREE OF REGRET, so it is not taken on every refusal,
// and the discriminator is one this layer already computes. Of the 2,186:
//
//	reason           n      ended cleanly anyway
//	drift          1,268    92 %
//	ceiling          518    75 %
//	no heartbeat     250    31 %
//
// Cutting the first two would throw away nine calls in ten that were about to
// answer and pay every one of their prompts again — strictly worse than waiting,
// which is why the purse exists at all. `no heartbeat` is the other animal
// entirely: it is [pathFaultReason], meaning not one byte has reached this
// stream — no token, not even a router comment — and across the whole log those
// attempts end cleanly 24 % of the time with a first token at the ninety-ninth
// percentile of 505 seconds. Cutting them at the ceiling forfeits about three
// calls in ten and rescues seven from waits measured in minutes.
//
// So: the ceiling acts. It hedges when it can afford to; when it cannot, and the
// wire has said NOTHING AT ALL, it cuts and the next machine gets the question.
//
// AND THE CUT NEEDS NOTHING NEW TO CARRY IT. It is an ordinary [StreamCut], so
// it leaves through the ordinary door: client.go stamps it with the machine the
// stream named and the ledger's strike sets [StreamCut.Rerouted], which the
// attempt loop already reads as a no-backoff move that vetoes the served
// endpoint (`TestABlindCutIsFiledAgainstTheMachineWeAskedFor` is that shape, and
// a cut that named nobody falls back to the machine the request asked for). So
// the free move IS a move to another machine and not merely an early ending.

// ── EVERY ATTEMPT IS WATCHED, AND IT IS THE SAME CONTROLLER EACH TIME ───────
//
// THE LAW: ONE CONTROLLER PER ATTEMPT OF EVERY REQUEST — the primary's, a
// rescue arm's, and every re-ask under either of them. A watch belongs to an
// ARM and an arm can send many times: the refusal loop under it re-encodes and
// re-sends ([Client.send]), and until 2026-09-11 all of those attempts shared
// one controller built at the moment the arm started. That is not a watch, it is
// a watch of the first attempt with the rest of them inside its shadow.
//
// THE MEASURED CASE (2026-09-11 14:32, the owner's task). Attempt 1 drew a
// relayed refusal; attempt 2 asked GMICloud, was served by another machine, and
// ran 363 SECONDS — and its row carried no action, no reason and no silence at
// all, while the 86-second attempt before it had at least said `ceiling`. Three
// of this type's once-only rules are why, and each of them is right for one
// attempt and wrong for a call: [streamWatch.acted] keeps the FIRST act, so the
// row of a later attempt can never be written; the controller's own `acted` fires
// a report once per controller; and a purse refusal is final per controller. So
// the second attempt of a recovered call was, by construction, unwatched.
//
// Re-arming is not forgetting. WHAT BELONGS TO THE QUESTION STAYS — the deadline
// and the move log are the plan's and the plan is not rebuilt — and what belongs
// to ONE SEND is what starts again: when this send went out, what it has written,
// who answered it, and what was done about its wait.

// attempt re-arms this watch for one send of its arm, and it is called by the
// send loop before every one of them ([Client.send]).
//
// IT IS UNCONDITIONAL AND HAS NO ATTEMPT NUMBER IN IT. A branch on "is this the
// first" would be the same rule written twice — the first send is a send like
