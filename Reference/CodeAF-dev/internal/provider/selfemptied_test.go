// ── AN IGNORE LIST NEVER EMPTIES THE SET THE REQUEST IS SENT TO ─────────────
//
// The strikes narrow the serving set. They may never narrow it to nothing: a
// request whose vetoes cover everything it is allowed to land on is a request
// the router can only refuse, and a refusal this process built for itself is
// not evidence about any endpoint. Every test here asserts the object the wire
// actually carries.

// THE MEASURED SHAPE (issue #584; canary cell pallets-click-3740-do, rows
// 72-75). A demand names one lane and the ledger's veto names the same lane, on
// one request, because the demand is applied after the veto and never looked at
// it. The router answered "All providers have been ignored" in 36ms — before
// any endpoint was asked — and both arms of the hedge were refused inside 40ms.
