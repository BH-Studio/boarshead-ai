// ── THE REFUSAL THAT COULD NEVER ACT ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every test in this file is one law of issue #266, and all of them are proved
// against a REAL refusal on a real wire: the stub publishes a lane on its
// endpoints page and will not serve it, which is the disagreement the reported
// run was made of, and the body it answers with is the router's own
// `…but your request's provider.only preference permits only: …`.
//
// Nothing here synthesises an error value. The whole defect was that a refusal
// arriving through the transport was classified three different ways by three
// pieces of code, so a test that handed one of them a hand-built [APIError]
// would be testing the piece rather than the path.

// refusalLanes is the scenario every test below is staged on: five tool-capable
// machines on the sheet, two of which the router will not serve.
//
// Ghost and Phantom are the two the sheet publishes and the wire refuses; Haven
// is the machine that finally answers. The two behind it are the rest of the
// model's endpoints — real, servable, and out of the frontier this scenario
// hands the race, which is what keeps the walk's order a fact rather than a
// draw from the chooser.
