// ── STICK TO THE ENDPOINT THAT HOLDS YOUR CACHE ─────────────────────────────
//
// A prompt cache is not a property of a model, an account or a router. IT LIVES
// ON ONE MACHINE. The transcript layer earns a byte-stable prefix (internal/
// session's prefixcache_test.go pins the law: request N's messages must reappear
// unchanged at the head of request N+1's), and that stability is worth exactly
// nothing if the two requests are served by two different endpoints — the second
// one has never seen those bytes and re-prices every one of them at the uncached
// rate.
//
// THE MEASUREMENT THIS ANSWERS. One benchmark chat turn of 41 requests hopped
// across six OpenRouter endpoints in eleven moves; one task of 60 requests
// crossed nine endpoints in thirteen. Two adjacent requests of near-identical
// size, same model, same account: 94053 prompt tokens with 256 cached cost
// $0.00846, and 94432 prompt tokens with 93952 cached cost $0.00179. Same
// context, 4.7× the price, and the only difference was which machine answered.
// Across that run 26% of requests came in under a 50% cache hit and burned 54%
// of the main agent's spend.
//
// The rule is one sentence: STICK TO THE ENDPOINT THAT HOLDS YOUR CACHE, AND
// MOVE ONLY WHEN IT FAILS YOU. It costs nothing to keep — no probe, no extra
// request, no clock. What is remembered is one endpoint name per prompt lineage,
// and the next request asks for it first.

// endpointPins is which endpoint holds each prompt lineage's cache.
//
// THE LINEAGE, NOT THE SESSION AND NOT THE MODEL ALONE, is the unit. A prompt
// cache belongs to whatever owns a growing byte prefix: a conversation owns one,
// and so does each leaf of a fan-out, which is why the run key is narrowed per
// leaf (hints.go's WithLeafCacheKey). That is exactly what the cache key already
// names, so this ledger is keyed on it, paired with the model — a /model swap is
// a different prefix on a different set of endpoints and may not inherit a pin.
//
// It is in memory and it has NO EXPIRY, which is deliberate rather than
// forgotten. A remote cache dies on its own schedule and no constant here could
// guess it; a pin that outlives the cache it was for costs nothing to hold — the
// endpoint is simply one of the ones that could have answered — and the very
// next successful answer can warm it again (see [Client.noteEndpointAffinity]).
// A guessed timeout would be a second, worse copy of a fact the wire reports.
