// TestThePurseIsAskedThroughOneDoor is the law the deleted allowance broke.
//
// THERE IS ONE RAIL IN FRONT OF A SECOND REQUEST, ONE PRICE, AND TWO PLACES
// THAT ASK IT — one per side of the decision, and no more.
//
// What made the process-wide budget able to overrule the controller was that it
// was asked from five places under three different names — the controller's
// hedge, the stall rescue, the walk, the countdown's reading and the ladder's —
// each with its own idea of what a refusal meant. Two doors survive that, and
// they are not two mechanisms:
//
//   - [hazard.reachable] asks BEFORE DECIDING. A move the purse will refuse is
//     not a move, so a controller that did not ask would hand back a hedge that
//     cannot happen and the request would sit through a rescue nobody could pay
//     for — see THE PURSE IS ASKED LAST in hazard.go's act.
//   - [hedgeRace.affordsLocked] asks BEFORE SENDING, because the controller is
//     not the only thing that starts an arm: the stall rescue, the walk past a
//     refusal and the surface's own countdown all reach the wire through here.
//
// AND THEY ASK WITH THE SAME NUMBER, which is the half that makes them one
// mechanism rather than two. [Alternative.Extra] is priced once where the plan
// is built and both sides read it ([hedgeRace.altPrice]); two estimates for one
// bound is how the rail and the decision come to disagree about what this
// question can afford.
//
// This walks the source of both packages and fails on any third asker.
