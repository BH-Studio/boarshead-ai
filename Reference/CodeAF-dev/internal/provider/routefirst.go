// ── `auto` FIRST, THE BELIEF WHEN THE ROUTER LETS GO ────────────────────────
//
// The `lane` row's default is `auto`, and what `auto` means changed here:
// OpenRouter routes, and this build watches. Every answer names the machine
// that served it, and that machine's waits and outcomes land in the belief
// ledger ([Client.noteLane], [Client.noteLaneOutcome]) whether or not this
// build asked for it — so a takeover, when one comes, is never a cold guess.
//
// A takeover is earned, never assumed: two refusals, or two answers that lost
// their thread, inside the window that remembers them. One bad minute is a
// queue draining somewhere; two of them is the router sending the next call to
// the same machine. When the window opens the chooser ranks the lanes it has
// been learning from all along and the request carries its set — the same
// object a pin would send — and when the window lapses the row is `auto`
// again, which is the same thing said in reverse: OpenRouter routes, and this
// build watches.
//
// THE FLOOR IS THE SAME FLOOR THE STRIKE LEDGER ALREADY KEEPS. A refusal is
// forgotten after five minutes (velocity.go's ignoreCooldown, mirrored in
// internal/lane's AvailabilityHalfLife) and a takeover after thirty — long
// enough for a person to feel the difference, short enough that one bad
// evening does not re-route the week. Neither figure is tuned here: the window
// is the strike ledger's cooldown counted twice over, and the threshold is the
// number of bad answers a person has already been offered by the time anybody
// would reach for `/model`.

	// belief a lane will answer at all.
