// The concurrency doctrine: codeaf sets no artificial ceiling on how much work
// runs at once — the only real limit is what the provider's rate limiting
// permits, and the provider tells us when we cross it. This limiter is that
// signal made adaptive, TCP-style AIMD: every 429 halves the number of
// requests allowed in flight (multiplicative decrease), every stretch of
// clean successes adds one back (additive increase), so admission converges
// on whatever rate the account actually sustains — no constant to mistune.
//
// EVERY CUT HEALS, and that is not decoration. A halving is a guess about a
// moment, and this process is not the only thing spending the account's rate:
// sibling codeaf processes share the key, so a cut here is often a report about
// somebody else's second. A guess that can only ever tighten is a ratchet. So
// capacity comes back two ways — in successes under load, and on the clock when
// there is no load to earn them with (healLocked).

// a sibling's burst arrives here as if this process had caused it. Under that
// contention the halvings compound while the successes that would undo them
// never accumulate, so one minute of somebody else's traffic ratchets every
// session's throughput down and leaves it there. An idle process is worse
// still: it earns no successes at all, so without a clock its capacity never
// comes back at any speed.
//
// So quiet is the second currency, and it is the one a sibling cannot spend.
