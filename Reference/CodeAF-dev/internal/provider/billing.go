// A BILLED RESPONSE IS BANKED WHEN IT ARRIVES, NOT WHEN THE WORK LANDS.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS ANSWERS. A leaf's spend used to reach the journal exactly
// once, from the executor's in-memory total, on the way out of the run
// (resident.Runner.recordSpend). Every ending that returns no outcome therefore
// returned no money either: the ink run of 2026-08-29 made a hundred and nine
// billed calls over seventeen minutes, was given up on by its watchdog, and
// left a store whose usage table held one row — the planner's — and a cost.json
// reading $0.000228 for a run that had written a twenty-six kilobyte patch.
// The transcript had been hardened against exactly these endings a wave
// earlier, with a flush on each side of the abandonment; the money had no
// equivalent, so a $0.85 leaf and a free one were the same row.
//
// The fix is not another flush on another ending — there is always one more
// ending. The fact that was missing is that THE PROVIDER ALREADY KNOWS WHAT
// EACH CALL COST at the moment it decodes the answer, and this adapter is the
// one door every outbound call in the process passes through (calllog.go says
// so, and writes its own per-call row here for the same reason). So the row is
// written where the fact is known, and a turn roll-up becomes a second kind of
// record rather than the only one.
//
// It is reported through the context exactly as the transcript sink and the
// liveness span already are (exec.WithTranscript, exec.WithLiveness), because
// the adapter underneath is shared by every agent in the process and the call
// is the only thing that knows whose call it is. Nobody listening is the
// ordinary case — a unit test, a bench harness, a client built for one probe —
// and costs one type assertion.
//
// A SECOND DOOR reports calls the wire never priced. [WithReconcile] is kept
// apart from [WithBilling] because the ordinary response and the provider's
// later receipt are mutually exclusive facts: one sink fires for a usage block
// and the other fires only when that block never arrived. Keeping those doors
// separate is what makes it impossible for one call to be banked through both.

// Billed is one model response the provider charged for, as the adapter read it
// off the wire. It carries the node the call belongs to so a listener does not
// have to re-derive it: the same [WithCallNode] the call log is keyed by names
// the work, and a call made without one is spend nobody can file.
