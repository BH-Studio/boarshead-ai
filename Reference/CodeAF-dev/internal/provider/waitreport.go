// ── WHAT A RACE LEAVES BEHIND ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One question that became more than one request has two audiences afterwards
// and they want different things. A CALLER wants the slot: which lane answered,
// which was cancelled, what the rescue cost, and — while it is still happening
// — that one is in flight at all, because the only interesting state of a
// rescue is the one that is over before the call returns. A LOG wants the row:
// when the silence was acted on, what was done, how many arms it took, and what
// the arms that did not answer cost.
//
// Both are written here so that hedge.go is about arms and cancels and neither
// audience has a second place to look.

// ── WHAT THE LEDGER AND THE LOG ARE TOLD AFTERWARDS ─────────────────────────

// HedgeReport is what one request's rescue cost and bought, written into the
// caller's own slot exactly like [ServedEndpoint].
//
// It is a slot rather than a field on the response for the reason the served
// endpoint is: the SDK's response type is the OpenAI shape, and racing is this
// adapter's own bookkeeping. `internal/session`'s usage ledger reads it to
// write `hedged`, `lane` and `hedge_waste_usd` on the row.
type HedgeReport struct {
	mu sync.Mutex
	// hedged is whether a second request went out at all.
	hedged bool
	// winner is the lane whose answer the caller got, loser the lane that was
	// cancelled — both empty when no stream named one.
	winner string
	loser  string
	// reason is the controller's own machine word ("first token late", "drift",
	// "long think", "ceiling", "no heartbeat", "rate collapsed"). It is for
	// the log and never for a person.
	reason string
	// waste is what the arms that did not answer are estimated to have cost. It
	// is an ESTIMATE and says so: a cancelled stream delivers no usage frame,
	// so what is known is how many tokens it had written and what the lane
	// charges for them.
	waste float64
	// primary is the lane the FIRST request was served by, whichever arm went
	// on to win. It is a different fact from the winner and the loser, and it

	// finished on coreweave" cannot be said from a pair whose names swap places
	// depending on who won.

	// is what keeps the belief out of it.

	// nobody has committed, which is the sentence a person reads on the status
	// line. A caller that registers nothing is told nothing, and nothing here
	// waits on it.
	//
	// IT CARRIES THE REASON AND NOT ONLY THE LANE, and it carries a retraction.

	// screen for ten minutes after the arm it was about had died (issue #266).
