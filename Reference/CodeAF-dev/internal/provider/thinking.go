// The reasoning policy: what is sent to a model about its thinking pass, and
// how much room the answer is given behind it. It follows OpenRouter's
// published contract for the unified reasoning knob rather than anything of
// this adapter's own devising, and it is the ONE place the two questions are
// answered — the encoder reads it to shape the request and the transport reads
// it to size its wait, so the two can never disagree about how long a reply
// may be.
//
// What the contract says, and what each rule below is for:
//
//   - A model whose row carries reasoning.mandatory cannot have the pass turned
//     off; the router's own instruction is "do not send effort: none — the
//     model rejects it". Sending NOTHING instead is worse than it looks: the
//     model then runs at its published default, which for GLM 5.3 is "max",
//     and a ten-thousand-token thinking pass ate the intent compiler's whole
//     answer on 2026-08-28. So off on such a model becomes the LOWEST effort
//     word the row lists — "low" on GLM 5.3 cut that pass to 122 tokens.
//
//   - Reasoning tokens are output tokens and bill against max_tokens; the
//     contract's sizing rule is "max_tokens must be strictly higher than the
//     reasoning budget". The effort words are allocations of the ceiling —
//     minimal ≈10%, low ≈20%, medium ≈50%, high ≈80%, xhigh/max ≈95% — so an
//     answer that needs A tokens behind an effort that takes share s of the
//     ceiling needs a ceiling of A/(1-s). A budget in tokens is exact: A plus
//     the budget.
//
// Nothing here is a list of model names. The row is the authority when it is
// known; the quirks memo — a refusal, or an answer that came back empty at the
// ceiling — is what stands in for a row the catalog has not seen.

// ReasoningProfile is the provider's published account of one model's
// thinking pass, in this package's vocabulary. The catalog carries the same
