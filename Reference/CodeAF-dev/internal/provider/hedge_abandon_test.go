// A CANCELLED RACE ANSWERS ITS CALLER AT ONCE, AND SETTLES UP BEHIND THEM.
//
// The caller of a cancelled race is almost always a person who has just typed a
// correction into a running turn: internal/session cut the generation on their
// steer and is blocked in this package until it comes back, and the next thing
// that should reach the wire is their own words. So the law is about WHO PAYS
// the close-out, not about whether it happens — the arms still get drained, the
// offer still comes down and the money is still noted, on a goroutine nobody is
// waiting on.
//
// [abandonGrace] is a whole second, which is the entire allowance
// [lane.SpokenWithin] gives the person: a caller that paid it had nothing left
// to spend on the request they were waiting for.
