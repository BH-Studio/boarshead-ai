// The unit tests of the choice live in `internal/lane`, where they belong: the
// arithmetic is pure and none of it needs a socket. What cannot be tested there
// is the JOIN — that the preference the chooser formed reaches the wire as
// `provider.order`, and that the answer which comes back reaches the ledger as
// a sighting. Both directions cross the boundary exactly once and both are
// tested here against `internal/lane/lanestub`, a real HTTP router with lanes
// of a scripted speed.

// recordingLedger is a ledger primed with fixed beliefs that also keeps what it
// is told. It is the instrument for both directions at once.
