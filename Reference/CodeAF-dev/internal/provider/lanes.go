// ── THE ADAPTER BETWEEN A BELIEF AND A WIRE ─────────────────────────────────
//
// `internal/lane` holds what this build believes about the machines behind a
// model. It has no transport: it never opens a connection, never reads a clock
// of its own and never draws anything. This file is the whole of the join
// between it and the router's dialect, and the arrows point one way
// (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, Decision 10):
//
//	request  →  lane.Chooser.Choose  →  provider.order / provider.ignore
//	answer   →  lane.Ledger.Note     →  the belief this process measured itself
//
// TWO LAWS SHAPE EVERY LINE OF IT.
//
// AN EMPTY CHOICE IS A REAL ANSWER. On a machine that has never used a model
// the ledger believes nothing, the chooser says nothing, and the request is
// shaped exactly as it was before this package existed — the sort word, the
// strike ledger's order, the price ceiling, the affinity pin. Nothing here has
// a fallback of its own to invent, because the transport already has one that
// works.
//
// NOTHING HERE FETCHES. The chooser reads memory and the ledger is written from
// answers that have already arrived. `lane_law_test.go` fails the build if any
// non-test file in this package so much as names the sheet's Refresh, and that
// is the law this file must keep hardest: it runs inside the encoder, in front
// of somebody's first token.

// version of the same split and the worse one, because every install routes by

// no such page for the alias. Filed as written, this side keyed

// `~deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-latest`, and the machines that answered were
// `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731`'s. One model, three ledger keys, and the
// default model of every install therefore chose between no lanes at all.
//
// [lanes.LedgerModel] folds both — the tier suffix and the alias — and the fold
// is INJECTED rather than imported, so on a build with no catalog installed this
// line is exactly the bare-model normalisation it always was. The alias is
