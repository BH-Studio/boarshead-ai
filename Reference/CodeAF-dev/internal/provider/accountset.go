// ── A CEILING ONLY AN EXCLUDED MACHINE FITS UNDER ───────────────────────────
//
// The price ceiling is list × [latencyPriceCeiling], and a model's list price is
// its CHEAPEST machine's tariff — which is very often the first-party machine,
// and the first-party machine is exactly the kind an account's paid-training
// switch takes away. So for this account the ceiling can admit one machine and
// that machine can be one the account will never reach: the ceiling is then a
// demand in all but name, and nothing this process held knew it.
//
// ── THE MEASURED FAILURE (2026-09-10, the real binary, deepseek-v4.1-flash) ──
//
// A fresh process on a home that had already learned DeepSeek was excluded —
// the pin on it was stood down before it was sent, as designed — still paid a
// 404 on every turn. The primary carried no demand and no veto, only
// `order: [Fireworks, DeepInfra]` and `max_price {prompt 0.1875, completion
// 0.75}`, which is 1.25 × DeepSeek's own 0.15 / 0.60; the router's funnel
// answered `Initial Endpoints 8 → Filter by Max Price 1 → Filter by Guardrails
// 0`. The walk rescued each turn onto DeepInfra, so nothing failed where a
// person could see it — and nothing learned anything either: the refusal named
// no machine, so the account's set never grew, and the ladder whose price rung
// would have dropped the ceiling was deferred to a walk that won.
//
// ── THE LAW ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A CEILING THAT ADMITS ONLY MACHINES THE SERVING SET RULES OUT IS NOT SENT.
// That is the price rung's own answer reached without paying for it, and it
// keeps the promise the price rung was split out to keep (#678): the ceiling
// comes off only when there is NO wider set under it to try, which the sheet
// can say before the request goes and the ladder could only find out after.
//
// AND A REFUSAL THAT NAMES NO MACHINE STILL TEACHES WHICH MACHINES IT WAS
// ABOUT, when the router's own count and this process's sheet agree exactly on
// the set this request's filters left. That is what makes the law above bite on
// the turn after the first refusal rather than only after somebody happens to
// demand the machine.

// ceilingOnlyAdmitsTheUnserved reports whether every machine the sheet prices
// under this ceiling is one the serving set rules out for this model — the
// account's exclusions and this model's own refusals both, through the one
// reader of that set ([lanes.Serves]).
//
// ABSENCE, NEVER A GUESS, which is [Client.priceCeiling]'s own rule stated
// again. A model with no sheet, or a ceiling the sheet puts nobody under, says
// nothing about reachability, and the ceiling goes out exactly as before; the
// ladder is still there for whatever the router says about it.

// learnExcludedFromTheSet files the machines an account-policy refusal was
// about when the refusal itself named none — a request with no demand, whose
// set was only this process's ceiling and vetoes over the router's roster.
//
// IT LEARNS ONLY ON AN EXACT AGREEMENT, and it learns nothing otherwise. The
// router says how many machines the request's own filters left
// (`input_endpoint_count`) and that its account policy removed every one of
// them; the sheet says which machines those filters leave, as this process
// sees the roster. When the two counts are equal they are the same set, and
// each machine in it is excluded exactly as a demanded one would have been.
// When they differ — a sheet that has not caught up, a parameter filter the
// router applied first, an account list this process cannot see — the refusal
// stays what it was before this existed: a list that emptied the set, which
// implicates nobody. A body without the metadata (the sentence alone) never
// teaches this, because the count is the whole of the evidence.
//
// A WRONG LESSON IS BOUNDED. An exclusion keeps a machine from being demanded
// or ranked, never from answering, and the first answer it serves takes it back
