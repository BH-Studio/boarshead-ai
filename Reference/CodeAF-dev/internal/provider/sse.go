// sseDecoder reads the provider's event stream one message at a time.
//
// The SDK ships a decoder and this one exists because that one is quadratic in
// the length of a single message: it keeps an undelivered []byte, and every
// call converts the whole of it to a string to look for the blank line and
// converts the remainder back. On ordinary token deltas nobody could measure
// it. On one multi-megabyte message — a reasoning block delivered whole — the
// buffer is re-copied twice per 8 KB read, which is about a gigabyte of memcpy
// to deliver four megabytes. This reads through a bufio.Reader instead, so the
// bytes of a message are copied exactly once, and the SDK is left alone.
//
// It is a *replacement*, not an improvement: the framing below is the SDK's,
// quirks included, because a stream that decoded differently here would change
// answers. Messages are separated by "\n\n" and by nothing else — a CRLF
// stream has no separator at all as far as this is concerned, exactly as
// before — only a message beginning "data: " is looked at, "[DONE]" ends the
// stream with io.EOF, and anything that will not parse as JSON is skipped.
