// WHAT A NODE NAMES IS MEASURED AGAINST WHAT ONE WORKER CAN HOLD, AND WHAT IS
// MEASURED IS THE MATERIAL THE NODE WILL READ — NOT THE FILE ITS WORDS MENTION.
//
// Context pressure used to be a judgment. The sizing pass was asked whether
// "the node cannot be brought to an end inside what one worker can hold" — a
// model, guessing, about a quantity that is sitting on the disk in front of it.
// Measured on the brief in issue #384: three lanes of work over one 3,500-line
// file planned as ONE leaf, which then ran out of context reading its own
// subject, and the replan after the exhaustion drew the same one leaf again.
// Nothing in the run was wrong about the work. Everything in it was wrong about
// a number nobody had bothered to read.
//
// So it is read. But reading the number is only half of it, and the other half
// is which number. A first version of this pass read the file NAMES out of a
// node's sources, stat'ed each one whole, and summed the sizes; on a plan that
// had divided a wide brief correctly — one lane per block of one big file — it
// reported `2 files, 165.4 KB in all … 5.2 times what one worker can hold` on a
// node whose own sources said `register.txt: header lines, North block heading,
// 1,160 North records`. Every correctly divided lane was then stamped oversized
// and handed over whole, which is the exact state the measurement was added to
// prevent (issue #480). A node's source line carries its SCOPE, and the scope is
// the material:
//
//   - A bare file name is the whole file. "rewrite corpus.txt in three lanes"
//     names all of corpus.txt, and nothing about the sentence says otherwise.
//   - A file name followed by a scoping mark — a colon, a dash, a bracket — is
//     scoped by the words after it, and contributes only the share those words
//     name. See scopedShare for exactly which shapes of scope are read.
//   - A scope this pass cannot resolve to a share contributes NOTHING. That is
//     the pass's own standing rule for anything it cannot weigh: a guess about
//     unmeasured material is the thing this replaces, and it is no better a
//     guess for being an over-estimate.
//
// Everything here is silent when there is nothing to measure. No workspace, a
// goal that names no file that exists, or a scope nobody can resolve renders
// zero bytes and changes no verdict.

// Reach is what one worker holds at a time, and the workspace whose files the
// words of a goal are measured against.
//

// with no workspace has nothing to weigh, and a workspace with no window has
// nothing to weigh it against.

//     that many of the file's own mean line. The source said HOW MANY lines and
//     not WHICH, and this is the file answering the half it can answer.
//   - A COUNT OF HEADINGS — "all 30 `## chapter N: …` heading lines". Read
//     exactly rather than averaged, because it can be: the file says which of
//     its lines are headings, so these are the bytes of the lines themselves.
//   - A NAMED BLOCK OR HEADING — "the North block heading", "the `## chapter 3`

//     the extent from it to the next heading at or above its rank.
//
// Where a scope names more than one of these the LARGEST resolved share is the

// it finds on Node.BeyondReach; this pass never asks it and could not, because
// a division does not exist until the spine has drawn the stages it is made of.
//

// sources are larger than one worker's window may not be atomic, whatever the
// ruler said about the breadth of its subject. The verdict is corrected to
// oversized — which is the word the rest of the planner already routes on — and
// the reason is journaled on the node, where a splice clears it if the node does
// divide and a reader finds it if it does not.
//
// AND IT NEVER OVERRULES A DIVISION. A node the ruler called atomic, whose
// sources scope a REGION of a file that a sibling node also scopes a region of,
// is one lane of a division somebody has already made correctly: three lanes
// over one 144 KB register, each owning one 48 KB block, are three nodes that
// each name more than one worker holds and are nonetheless exactly right. There
// is nothing left for this pass to correct there — expansion cannot divide a
// lane over one file any further, so the correction only converts a good plan
// into a refusal (issue #480). A node that names a whole file larger than one
// worker's window has no such division behind it and is corrected as it always
// was.
//
// THE EXEMPTION ASKS FOR ATOMIC AND NOT MERELY FOR A SIZING, which is the
// issue's own wording and is worth stating because it has a live consequence: a
// lane the ruler called BORDERLINE over a file its siblings share is still
// corrected to oversized here. That is not obviously wrong — borderline is the
// ruler saying the node is already past the size it would like, and a division
