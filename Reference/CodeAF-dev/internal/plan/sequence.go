// AN OVERSIZED NODE THAT CANNOT BE DIVIDED INTO SIMULTANEOUS PARTS IS DIVIDED
// INTO ORDERED STAGES.
//
// The sizing pass has always named two things that discharge the burden of
// dividing: pieces that genuinely run at the same time, or a node that cannot be
// brought to an end inside what one worker can hold. Only the first ever had
// machinery behind it. A node whose inside is a sequence was asked the
// simultaneity question twice — once by the fan-out, once again by the expansion
// underneath it — and when it truthfully came back as one part both times, the
// second answer was journaled as "the division gave back one piece, which is the
// node again" and the node ran whole against the very budget it had already been
// measured past.
//
// This file is the second question, and it is asked only of the nodes the first
// one could not answer: after a fan-out has returned one part for a node the
// ruler put beyond one worker's reach. The division it looks for is in time
// rather than in width — the stages the piece passes through, each finishable on
// its own and each within reach — and the chain it draws is a shape the graph
// already has, so nothing downstream has to learn a new one.

// sequenceDepth is the most stages one piece may be drawn as, and it is stated
// once for two readers: the prompt below interpolates it, so the model is told
// the number, and the reply is given room for that many stages. A count a model
// is asked for and a count it is given room for are one fact — see fanOutWidth,
// where the two spellings drifting apart killed a whole run.
const sequenceDepth = 4

// sequenceDepthWord is sequenceDepth as the prompt spells it.
var sequenceDepthWord = strconv.Itoa(sequenceDepth)

// sequencePrompt asks for the ordered stages of one piece of work.
//
// It is the size prompt's second discharge, written as a question. Everything it
// states about why it is being asked comes from there in the same terms — the
// piece cannot be carried to an end inside what one worker can hold — because a
// model told only "break this into stages" draws the tidy phase list that the
// fan-out prompt spends four paragraphs refusing, and every one of those phases
// would be a barrier bought for nothing.
//
// So the premise it opens with is the one thing that makes an ordered division
// legitimate here, and it is stated as already settled: the simultaneity
// question has been asked and the answer was the node itself. What is left is
// the only division that remains, and the guards on it are the spine's own —
// fewest stages, no merge stage, and one stage is a correct answer.
//
// It names no domain and carries no example, for the reason the expansion burden
// beside it carries none: a domain named in a prompt that every sequence in
// every job passes through is a shape the model will find again whether or not
// it is there.
var sequencePrompt = `You break one piece of work into the ordered stages it is made of.

` + agentPremise + `

This piece cannot be brought to an end inside what one worker can hold: however
it is written, the worker would be stopped part-way through and resumed. Nothing
inside it runs at the same time as anything else — that has already been asked,
and the answer was the piece itself — so the only division left is in time.

Draw the ordered stages the piece passes through. Each one is finishable and
checkable on its own, produces a deliverable of its own, and is within one
worker's reach. What a stage leaves behind is what the next stage starts from,
so a stage that has to see the whole piece at once is not a stage.

For every stage list in "needs" the number of the stage whose output it starts
from. The first stage starts from the piece itself and lists none: []. Two
stages that could be done in either order are one stage, not two.

Use the fewest stages that are genuinely ordered, and never more than ` + sequenceDepthWord + `. Do
not add a final merge, synthesis or summary stage; that is added after you.

Return a single stage when the piece has no order inside it. That leaves the
piece whole, and it is a correct answer rather than a failure to divide.

// sequenceOnce asks the stage question of one piece and returns what it drew,

//
// It reuses the spine's schema and the spine's levelling rather than growing a
// second grammar for stages: what comes back is a list, and a list has an order
// whether or not the work does. Levelling reads the stated needs instead, so
// stages that wait for nothing are one stage — and a "sequence" whose stages
// wait for nothing is not one, which the acceptance check then says in words.
//
// The class is named here rather than left to the caller because a call should
// say what it is. Inside an expansion the outer override makes it plan.expand
// either way, which is where every stage question is asked from today.

// road, and it was seen happening on the second of two draws of the same brief.
