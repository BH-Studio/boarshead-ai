// revisePrompt is the sentinel. It runs when something has been learned — a
// node finished and its result contradicts an assumption, or a person changed
// the goal — and it may rewrite only what has not started.
//
// The danger here is not that it edits badly, it is that it edits at all. Give
// a model the power to replan and it will replan, every time, forever: that is
// the agent that plans beautifully and ships nothing. So the default is stated
// as no change, and any edit has to name three specific things — which result,
// which assumption, which node. A revision that cannot point at all three is
// almost always the model restating a preference rather than reacting to
// information.
//
// The frozen rule is not advisory and is enforced in code as well as stated
// here. A started node's output may already be another node's input, so the
// past cannot be edited; a correction to finished work is new work appended
// after it, never a rewrite of it.
//
// It carries checkingRule for a reason found the expensive way. The rule was
// written into the two prompts that build a plan and into neither of the two
// that grow one, and this is the pass that grows one mid-run: told a result was
// disappointing, it would add a node to look at what another node produced, that
// node would report a gap, and the gap would come back here. That is the shape
// of the 27-round spiral the governors could only bound by counting. A cap stops
// a loop; the doctrine stops it being started.
//
// The paragraph about what a new node may be restates the worker premise in its
// own words on purpose — see workerPremise for the shared fact. Here it is a
// bound on the size of an edit rather than a description of the executor, and
// the sentence that follows it is the whole point of the sentence before it.

` + agentPremise + `

Something has happened, and you decide whether the remaining plan should change.

The plan is a hierarchy. Indented nodes are parts of the node above them, and a
node marked "gathers" is not work — it is where its parts' results come back
together. Aim an edit at the node that actually does the work: changing what a
gathering node collects, when the problem is in one of its parts, fixes nothing
and disconnects the rest.

Nodes marked [locked] have started or finished. You cannot touch them: their
output may already be feeding another node. If finished work turned out wrong,
the answer is a new node that corrects it, never an edit to the old one.

Anything you add is going to one agent working alone, in order, with tools. Keep
a new node to something one agent finishes in a single pass and hand off as one
result. If what is needed is genuinely larger than that, add it as two or three
nodes that can run at the same time rather than one that cannot.

` + checkingRule + `

Your default is no change. Return an empty operation list unless a specific
result contradicts a specific assumption in a specific unstarted node. If you
cannot name all three, there is nothing to do here, and saying so is the right
answer.

Do not restructure work that is merely imperfect. Do not add nodes because more
detail would be nice. Do not reorder for tidiness. Every edit you make risks
invalidating work already in flight.

When a node was CANCELLED by the user, that is a decision and not a problem. Do
not add a node that redoes it, finishes it, resumes it, or checks what it left
behind — the user is spending nothing more on that work, and adding it back is
overruling them. The only legitimate edit is to the steps that were relying on
it: rewire, retitle or remove them as the loss of that input requires.

When you do act, use the fewest operations possible:
- add     a new node, with its inputs, when new work is genuinely required
- remove  an unstarted node whose purpose no longer exists
- rewire  an unstarted node's inputs when it now needs different information
- retitle an unstarted node whose scope has shifted

For every operation, give the reason as the concrete contradiction you found.`
