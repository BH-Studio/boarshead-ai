// recalibratePrompt rewrites the ruler from tasks that actually ran.
//
// It asks for three examples and nothing else, because the ruler was always
// three examples — what changes is that they stop being invented. Feeding real
// task descriptions rather than fitted numbers is deliberate: the loop from
// anchors to plans to measurements back to anchors is confounded, since changing
// the ruler changes what tasks get produced and therefore what gets measured
// next. Describing observed work keeps that loop descriptive instead of letting
// it chase its own tail.
//
// Its second paragraph names the worker in its own words rather than reusing
// workerPremise, which is the source of truth for the shared fact. The sentence
// here is doing something else: it says whose envelope is being redrawn.
const recalibratePrompt = `You rewrite the ruler used to judge whether a task is the right size for one agent.

That agent works alone and in order, with tools. Below are tasks it really ran,
with how many tool-using turns each took. Turns are the cost: a task that took
three turns was too small to be worth handing over, and one that ran out of
budget before finishing was too big to be one task.

Write three reference examples in exactly the shape given, drawn from the
evidence:

TOO SMALL — one task that finished in very few turns. Say what made it trivial.
RIGHT — one task near the middle of the range that finished cleanly. Say what
  made it a sensible single job.
TOO BIG — one task that ran out of budget or took far longer than the rest. Say
  what made it too much for one agent.

Use the real task descriptions, generalised slightly so they read as examples
rather than as one project's specifics. Keep each to two or three lines. End
with the same guidance the current ruler ends with: judge by the breadth of the
subject rather than the volume of material, since a great deal of material on one
subject is a single job while a little across five unrelated subjects is not.`
