// mintedInside puts every node of a sub-graph inside the spec of the node it
// came out of. It is the one seam a claim-time child passes through, and it
// takes the parent's whole SPEC rather than a field of it — a division that
// inherited its constraints and not its criterion is a child minted inside half
// of what its parent was held to, and which half was a matter of whichever
// caller was written last.
//
// Until it existed, an expansion inherited the graph-level premises — the
// settled points, the terrain, the invoice — and NOTHING off the node. The
// children came back with an empty Spec, so a divided node lost its criterion,
// its working method and (once they existed) the rules the person set, all at
// once and silently. See expandScoped, its one caller.
//
// Each field keeps its own law, and they are different laws for good reasons:
//
//   - Done and Method are FILLED WHERE EMPTY AND NEVER OVERWRITTEN. What the
//     sub-plan wrote about a child is about that child and beats anything
//     inherited; what it left empty used to be nothing at all, and the parent's
//     is the only standard in the building that applies. Inside a full build the
//     brief and contract passes run after this and write their own, which is
//     the same rule expressed by ordering.
//   - Constraints go on EVERY child, because a rule the person stated is a
//     property of the job and dividing a node is not how a job walks out from
//     under it. See SetConstraints.
//   - Accept follows the checklist's own law and answers to deliverableOwner:
//     the request's behaviours belong to whoever hands the finished thing over,
//     and a sub-graph with several sinks has not gathered yet — stamping all of
//     them would buy one repair round per sink for one gap. See SetAcceptance.
//
// Instruction and Sources are deliberately NOT inherited. A child told its
// parent's whole instruction does its parent's whole job — the appetite failure
// the fan-out rule exists to refuse — and its own sources are what the division
// just decided. A child with no instruction falls back to its brief, which is
// what every reader downstream already does.
