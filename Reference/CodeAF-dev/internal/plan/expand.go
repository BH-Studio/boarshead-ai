Only two things buy it. Either the parts genuinely run at the same time, none of
them waiting on another, so the wait becomes the longest part instead of the sum
of all of them; or this piece cannot be carried to an end inside what one worker
can hold, so it would be stopped and resumed however it is written. Steps that
follow one another buy neither: they land no sooner than the undivided piece and
they add a briefing apiece and a reassembly at the end that it never paid for.

Every part must be sayable more precisely than this piece is — a deliverable of
its own and its own condition for being finished, both writable without
reference to the other parts. Narrower wording of the same job is not a part,
and two parts that would finish on the same condition are one part with the
answer bought twice. Where you cannot carry that, one part is the right answer

// here without a model is whether the split even claims a difference, and a
// split that hands two children the same deliverable is not claiming one. Only
