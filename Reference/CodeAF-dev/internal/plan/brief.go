// briefPrompt writes the instruction a leaf is actually handed.
//
// This is the boundary of the whole system: everything above it is structure,
// and this is where structure turns into something an agent can run. The agent
// on the other side sees nothing but these words — not the goal, not the graph,
// not its neighbours — so anything the instruction leaves out is simply absent.
//
// Three failure modes are worth writing against. An instruction that assumes
// context produces an agent that invents it; and an instruction without
// explicit boundaries produces agents that all drift toward the same
// interesting middle of the problem, which is how a wide graph collapses back
// into duplicated work.
//
// Its second paragraph is workerPremise, shared verbatim with the working
// method: both passes are writing for the same machine, and the one place that
// fact was restated rather than shared is the one place it was wrong.
//
// The third is narrower and was the most expensive. The goal reaches every
// agent, so a goal naming a deliverable reads to all of them as an instruction
// to produce it — five nodes once wrote the same REVIEW.md over the top of each
// other. The graph already knows who owns it, so the brief is told, and every
// non-owner is told in words that its result is handed over instead.
const briefPrompt = `You write the instruction that one agent receives.

` + workerPremise + `

It sees only what you write — not the wider goal, not the plan, not the other
agents' work. Whatever you leave out is simply missing.

Write directly to it:
- Give it the context it needs to make sense of the job on its own.
- State exactly what it is responsible for delivering.
- Say what finished looks like in the terms of whoever will use the result —
  what they do with it, what they must see — and where to stop.
- Where other agents are delivering something adjacent, say which results are
  theirs, so this one does not redo them.

Exactly one node produces the goal's final deliverable, and you are told which.
When it is not this one, say plainly that the deliverable is that other agent's
to produce and that this agent hands its own result over instead of writing any
version of it — every agent sees the goal, and without this line they each write
the same file over the top of the others. When it is this one, say that it is
this agent's alone and that the other results arrive as inputs to it. This is a
statement about what the agent delivers, not a fence around what it may touch.

The boundary is always about what an agent is responsible for delivering, never
about what it is allowed to touch. Say nothing about which files, sections,
components or parts of the work it may or may not change. It must be free to do
whatever its own piece requires — including changing things that already exist,
and connecting its work into what is already there so that it actually takes
effect. An instruction that fences an agent off from the rest of the work
produces something that is correct in isolation and connected to nothing, which
is worth nothing.

Its work must be finished, not merely written. If the result has to be reachable,
callable, registered, wired in or otherwise made live to count as done, say so.

If it will receive results from earlier work, refer to those as inputs it will
already have. Do not tell it to go and find them.

No preamble, no headings, no meta-commentary, no mention of "the plan", "your
task", or "this node". 90-160 words of plain instruction.`

// criterionBlock is the second half of the same call.
//
// A stopping condition is the one fact nothing in the system carried. Rounds
// were bounded by counting them, results were judged against prose that had to
// be re-read to be understood, and a retry had nothing to inherit — so what a
// re-aimed node was judged against was whatever its replacement's author
// happened to write down. A criterion is the object that survives that.
//
// It rides this call rather than buying one. The instruction writer has already
// read the goal, the node and its inputs; asking it for the criterion in the
// same breath costs completion tokens and no prompt tokens at all, and asking
// anything else would mean paying twice to read the same thing.
//
// The last paragraph is the one that earns its place. A model told to state a
// criterion will state a generous one, and every condition it invents becomes a
// requirement the person never made — the same failure the working method's
// prompt already writes against, in the same words, because it is the same
// failure.
const criterionBlock = `
Alongside the instruction, state the criterion by which this work will be judged
finished. It is a positive statement of what must be true once the work has
landed — not a list of steps, and not the instruction said again.

Give it as a small set of independent conditions. Each one must be settleable by
someone who has the result in front of them and did not do the work. A condition
that can be settled by running something says the exact thing to run and what
its outcome must be. A condition that can only be settled by reading says what
must be present and what would make it absent.

Name the things the result must produce, by the names they will carry, so that a
reader holding only this criterion could tell whether they exist.

Write no condition the request did not ask for. A criterion that demands more
than the person asked is a criterion that cannot be met, and every condition you
invent becomes a requirement nobody made.

Answer with one bare JSON object and nothing else — no code fence around it and
no sentence before or after it — carrying the instruction and the criterion:
{"instruction": "<the instruction>", "done": {"produces": ["<name>"],
"conditions": [{"kind": "run"|"read", "check": "<what to run or look for>",
"expect": "<what its outcome must be>"}]}}`

// briefWithCriterion is the prompt as sent when the criterion is on. The
// instruction half is byte-identical to what it has always been, so the shared
// prefix every brief call in a build hits is untouched and the criterion costs
// nothing but its own completion.
const briefWithCriterion = briefPrompt + "\n" + criterionBlock

// grow fields nobody reads, and the condition list is capped again in code
