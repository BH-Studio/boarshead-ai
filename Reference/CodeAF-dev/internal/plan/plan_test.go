Decomposition has to earn itself. Keep a division only when you can say what it
buys: parts that genuinely run at the same time, or a gate that genuinely blocks
what follows. When the honest answer is that the pieces would run one after
another anyway, or that one agent would simply do the whole thing, that is the
plan — a goal that asks for one finished thing is one piece of work by default,
and returning it whole is a correct answer rather than a failure to decompose.

Checking the work is part of doing it, never a piece of work of its own. Do not
add anything whose purpose is to look at, confirm, review, or verify what
another part produced; whoever produces a thing is who checks it.

Judging one artifact is one part, whatever its length. The sections of a thing
under judgment are not independent items, because what the judgment exists to
catch lives in the cross-references between them — a figure in one section
contradicting a claim in another is invisible to a reader who was handed only
one of them. Divide repeated operations over items that stand alone; never
divide one act of comprehension.`
