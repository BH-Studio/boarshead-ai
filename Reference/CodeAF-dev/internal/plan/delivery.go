// The delivery law: where the finished thing has to appear, and the one shape of
// ask for which the answer is different.
//
// It was stated in five places and every place knew a different amount. The
// instruction the deliverable owner receives and the working method written for
// it both demanded the deliverable written out in the final message and never
// filed; the leaf's own system prompt (exec/linear.go) told the same worker to
// keep that message under about three hundred words and put the long version in
// a file; and only the delivery gate knew the fact that reconciles them — that
// an ask which named a file, or asks for a change to material that already
// exists, makes the file the deliverable and the split correct. One task died
// over four gate rounds on that gap: the round that filed a 37KB document was
// failed for obeying the sane rule, and no prompt in the system knew that a
// deliverable has a size.
//
// So the law is one thing with two shapes, and which shape applies is a property
// of the ask rather than of whichever prompt happens to be speaking. The two
// constants are the law; DeliveryLaw picks between them; and the sites that
// commission a deliverable render the one the ask calls for.
//
// The default shape then had to learn a second thing, from a run that did the
// work and was failed for it. The ask named no file, so this half applied, and
// the leaf genuinely built and ran the thing and left it in the workspace — and
// the law as written demanded it be written out in full in a message the same
// worker was told to keep short. It stalled three times trying to obey both,
// shipped a transcription instead of the result, and never mentioned the
// rendered output the person had actually asked to see. The missing fact was
// that an answer is not always made of sentences: where the work produced the
// thing, the produced thing is the answer and naming it is not a pointer. That
// fact is stated inside the constant rather than switched on from outside,
// because whether a run produced something is known only at the end of it,
// while this text is part of a standing prompt whose bytes must not vary from
// leaf to leaf — a per-run condition here would cost every leaf its warm prefix
// to say something the worker can perfectly well judge for itself.

// DeliverInMessage is the default shape, and it is the one that holds unless the
// ask itself is file-shaped.
//
// It states the split rather than a length, which is what lets it agree with the
// leaf's own budget instead of fighting it: the answer is never what gets filed,
// and the working always may be.
const DeliverInMessage = `The final message is the deliverable itself: the answer, the verdict, the
figures that carry it, written out there in full rather than filed somewhere and
named. A message that says where the answer lives instead of carrying it has
delivered nothing. Where there is more than the answer — the evidence, the
detail, the reasoning behind it — that working may live in a file: the split is
between the answer and its working, never between the answer and a pointer to
the answer.

Some answers are not made of sentences. Where the work produced a thing whose
form is a file — something that had to be built, rendered, compiled or run to
exist, and which a message could only transcribe rather than contain — that
produced thing is the answer, and the message delivers it by naming it, saying
what it is and what it does, and giving its substance: what it was run against,
what came back, what it shows, and what a reader should conclude. Retyping it
into the message is not delivery either, and no run has to choose between
finishing and transcribing. The demand for full text stands only where nothing
was produced that carries the answer.`

// DeliverToNamedFile is the carve-out, and it is the half nothing but the gate
// used to know.
//
// The wording follows the gate's own, because the gate is what judges the result
// and a worker held to a different sentence than the one it will be judged by is
// being set up to fail. Short is not thin here: a message beside an asked-for
// file is the correct shape, and its length convicts nothing.
const DeliverToNamedFile = `This ask is file-shaped — it named a file or document, or it asks for a change
to material that already exists — so the file IS the deliverable. Writing it
there is the work, not a way of avoiding the answer. The final message then
carries the answer itself, what was run and what came back, and the name of the
file; it never carries the file's whole contents, and its shortness convicts
nothing.`

// DeliveryLaw returns the half of the law that applies to an ask of this shape.
//
// It is exported because the bit is not the planner's to compute. Whoever holds
// the request holds the judgment — the chat session already makes it in the
// delivery gate, and `codeaf run` can make it from the goal — and everything
// below this line only needs the answer. See Graph.FileShaped for the wiring.
