// THE HALF OF THE MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE MEASUREMENT.
//
// reach.go weighs what a text names against what one worker holds, and
// reach_test.go pins that reading and the per-node verdict computed from it.
// What is pinned here is the other half: the three passes that read the GOAL's
// own measurement and act on the shape of the whole build — the spine's field
// of candidates, the undivided shortcut, and the fold of an atomic chain.
//
// Every one of them reads the goal and none of them reads a node. A node's
// verdict has one computation and one home, correctBeyondReach and
// Node.BeyondReach, because that verdict has a clause about the node's siblings
// in it and none of these three passes can see a sibling. See reach.go.

// The spine is told the measurement rather than asked to guess at it, and a
// sample answering "one stage" — one worker holding all of it — is set aside
// before the vote where the measurement has already ruled that shape out. Two
// such samples used to outvote the one that laid the work out in stages.
