// The acceptance checklist: what the request asked for, read once, before the
// work.
//
// This is the fact nothing in the system held. `Done` is the criterion the
// PLANNER states about what the work will produce — at most six conditions, in
// the planner's own words, aimed at outputs. A request's forty bullets of stated
// behaviour never became structure anywhere, so at the moment of judgement there
// was no checklist for a deliverable to be short against, and the gate weighed
// the only account of coverage it had: the worker's own sentence about the tests
// the worker had itself written. Two graded runs shipped at exit 0 that way, one
// of them a single hidden test short of a solve (docs/design/gate/ACCEPTANCE.md).
//
// It reads the request and nothing else, and it runs before any work exists, so
// nothing it says can have moved in response to what the work turned out to be —
// which is the same property Grounds protects and for the same reason.
//
// THE WORKER IS NEVER SHOWN THIS LIST. Spec.Render deliberately omits it. A
// worker handed the list of behaviours it will be checked on writes checks for
// the list and nothing else, which is the failure being fixed one level up.

// The errand that measured this asked for one command to be run and its final

// The run spent more than 97% of its money and 82% of its wall answering a

const acceptancePrompt = `You read one request and list the behaviours it states.

A behaviour is something that must be observably true of the finished work: a
rule it must follow, a case it must handle, a transition it must make, an input
it must accept, an outcome it must produce. One point per behaviour the request
states, in the request's own vocabulary, short enough to read in one breath.

Some of what a request asks for is not a behaviour of the finished work at all
but an ACTION of the run: a command to run, a report to make, a file to read, a
step to take on the way. Write those down too, with kind "action"; write a
behaviour of the finished work with kind "behaviour". The difference decides
whether anything goes looking for a test of it, and nothing can test an action
that happens once and leaves nothing behind.

ONE POINT PER BEHAVIOUR, NOT PER SENTENCE. A sentence that names four defaults
states four behaviours; a clause that lists three accepted inputs states three; a
rule with an exception states the rule and the exception. Split them, and let
each point quote its own clause. A point that carries several behaviours at once
is a point no single check can be matched to, and the whole use of this list is
matching checks to it one at a time.

Every point carries the words of the request it comes from. Quote them verbatim
— you may skip a middle with "..." and quote both halves, but every character
either side of an elision must be the request's own. A point you cannot quote is
a point the request did not make.

Write no point the request did not state. Do not add what a careful engineer
would also do, what the domain usually requires, or what would make the result
better. Every point you invent becomes a requirement nobody asked for, and the
work will be sent back to satisfy it.

Do not restate the request's summary, its title, or what the work is broadly
about. Those are not behaviours and nothing can check them.
