// Package plan builds and revises the task graph for a goal. It executes
// nothing; the graph is the product.
//
// The graph is generated through a spine of ordered stages and then immediately
// freed from it. Stages exist for two reasons, neither of which is scheduling.
// They keep generation cheap, because a stage can be fanned out knowing only
// the spine, so every stage expands at the same time. And they keep the result
// acyclic almost for free, because a generated dependency may only point at an
// earlier stage — or, in the single case where one part changes the material its
// siblings work on, at another node of the same stage, which is the one edge
// that is cycle-checked. Once the real edges are known, stage membership gates
// nothing: a node that needs no input starts immediately, whichever stage
// produced it.
//
// Four passes, each a single round no matter how large the graph gets:
//
//	spine    1 call     ordered stages — the only serial call in the system;
//	                    each stage names the earlier stages it consumes, and
//	                    stages that name nothing share a level (levels.go)
//	fan-out  S calls    every stage split into simultaneous parts, at once
//	bind     ≤S calls   what each node reads or waits behind, and what duplicates what
//	audit    S-1 calls  what each node is missing — the counterweight to bind
//
// Bind and audit are deliberately opposed. Bind is written to resist the
// model's habit of turning any plan into a chain, so it under-connects; audit
// asks the opposite question and puts back only the edges whose absence would
// leave a node unable to finish. Neither framing is trustworthy alone.

// agentPremise is the one paragraph every planning prompt shares. It is stated
// once and reused verbatim because it is the single assumption the whole design
// rests on: the executors are agents, so none of the human-shaped structure a
// model reaches for by default — owners, phases, effort, sign-off — describes
// anything real here.
//
// Its second paragraph is the correction W6 was written for. The premise used
// to say the workers were "instant, free, and unlimited in number", which is
// true of exactly one of the three axes and false on the other two: an agent is
// not instant, and it is certainly not free, because every branch re-pays
// whatever context it must be given before it can start. A planner told the
// workers are free has no reason to prefer any plan over a larger one, and the
// measured bills say the prompt side is where the money goes. So the denial is
// replaced by the honest trade — width is bought with context and paid back in
// waiting — and it is stated here, once, because every pass that can add work
// reads this paragraph.
//
// Its last sentence is the other half of the same correction, and it is the one
// that makes the trade decidable rather than merely stated. Three quantities are
// being spent by every division — the wait, the money, the quality of what comes
// back — and a prompt that names them separately invites a planner to improve
// one and call the decision made; every audited over-decomposition did exactly
// that, buying wall time nobody was waiting for at a cost nobody counted. So
// they are named once, as a single objective, and the sentence points at the
// prices rather than restating a rule: on this machine those three quantities
// are measured, the measurements ride the tail of this very call when they
// exist (see invoice.go), and a division that cannot be paid for out of them is
// a division nobody has a reason for. It says "when they are there" and not
// "always", because on a fresh machine they are not there, and a premise that
// demanded arithmetic against numbers nobody has would be asking the planner to
// invent them.
const agentPremise = `The work is done by AI agents. They can be started in any number and they start
together; they never talk to each other and never see each other's work. So
there are no owners, roles, hand-offs, schedules, or budgets, and no
coordination, review, or status work. That is human overhead, not structure.

What they cost is not time. It is the context each one must be given, and a
piece of work split in two costs whatever the second piece must be told that the
first was already told. A split that shares almost everything is nearly free; a
split that has to re-explain the whole subject twice is not. What the person
waits for is the longest chain, never the total — so width is worth buying, and
worth buying only where the pieces genuinely do not need the same thing said
twice.

The wait, the money and the quality of the answer are one thing being spent
together and never three things to trade against each other, so where measured
figures for this machine are given to you, a division has to pay for itself on
those figures rather than on how well it reads.`

// workerPremise is what the thing on the other side of a prompt actually is.
//
// Six prompts described it in prose and no two agreed, which matters because
// every one of them is writing *for* that worker: an instruction, a working
// method, a ruler, a repair. One of the six had it plainly wrong — it believed
// the worker held four tools — and nothing could catch that, because there was
// nothing for it to disagree with.
//
// It is deliberately the shared fact and only the shared fact. Sites whose
// wording is doing work of their own keep theirs and point here: sizing
// (size.go) needs the worker's serial capacity because capacity is what it
// measures, the ruler (recalibrate.go) needs the same in order to say whose
// envelope is being redrawn, the sentinel (revise.go) states it as a bound on
// what a new node may be, and the leaf's own system prompt (exec/linear.go)
// says it in the second person to the worker itself. Flattening those would
// cost the specialisation, not buy the sharing.
const workerPremise = `That agent works alone, in order, with tools. It cannot ask anyone anything and
nobody will follow up with it, so whatever it is handed is all it gets.`

// titleRule keeps the handle short. Titles are how a person and the model both
// address a node; the summary carries the meaning.
const titleRule = `Give a title of 1-3 words, like a short file name, distinct from the others.
Put the meaning in a one-line summary under 15 words, not in the title.`

// proportionRule is the size of the plan measured against the size of the ask.
//
// Every other guard here argues about where a boundary belongs once the work is
// already being divided. This one asks the question before that: how much of a
// plan does this deserve at all. It exists because the observed failure was not
// mis-drawn boundaries — it was ceremony, small asks arriving with a structure
// built for large ones, each part then earning its own verification round, and
// the user waiting on a graph to produce something one agent says in a
// paragraph. The structural caps downstream bound how far that can run; they
// cannot make the judgment, because by the time a cap fires the plan has already
// decided the work is big.
//
// It is stated as a burden of proof rather than a number. A threshold would be
// wrong at both ends — the same count is ceremony for one ask and thin for
// another — and asked plainly whether something could be decomposed, a model
// always says yes. Asked what each part buys, it can answer honestly.
//
// checkingRule is the paragraph the verification spirals needed, lifted out of
// proportionRule so that the passes which build a plan are not the only ones
// that state it.
//
// It was written for decomposition and it was true of every pass that can add
// work: a plan that hands checking to a separate part has both invented a piece
// of work that produces nothing and taught the part that does the work that
// finishing is someone else's problem. The sentinel could add exactly that node
// mid-run, one round at a time, and did — which is the doctrine gap under the
// 27-round spiral the governors could only bound.
//
// The extraction is byte-preserving by construction: proportionRule is the same
// literal with this paragraph spliced back in at the position it always held,
// and a test reads both against the original bytes.
const checkingRule = `Checking the work is part of doing it, never a piece of work of its own. Do not
add anything whose purpose is to look at, confirm, review, or verify what
another part produced; whoever produces a thing is who checks it.`

// The last line is the one the verification spirals needed. Checking is part of
// doing the work, and a plan that hands it to a separate part has both invented
// a piece of work that produces nothing and taught the part that does the work
// that finishing is someone else's problem.
const proportionRule = `Make the plan exactly as large as the goal, and no larger. A large plan for a
small goal is not thoroughness; it is delay and expense the person asking pays
for, and it is the more common mistake by far.

Decomposition has to earn itself. Keep a division only when you can say what it
buys: parts that genuinely run at the same time, or a gate that genuinely blocks
what follows. When the honest answer is that the pieces would run one after
another anyway, or that one agent would simply do the whole thing, that is the
plan — a goal that asks for one finished thing is one piece of work by default,
and returning it whole is a correct answer rather than a failure to decompose.

` + checkingRule + `

Judging one artifact is one part, whatever its length. The sections of a thing
under judgment are not independent items, because what the judgment exists to
catch lives in the cross-references between them — a figure in one section
contradicting a claim in another is invisible to a reader who was handed only
one of them. Divide repeated operations over items that stand alone; never
divide one act of comprehension.`

// verdictRule is the meta-judgment the qualitative guards above do not make.
//
// proportionRule asks whether the plan deserves to exist at all, checkingRule
// forbids a node that exists to look at another, and the subject test forbids
// phases passed off as parts. None of them states the ledger test a division
// has to pass once it is past all of those: that each part buys back, in
// parallel time saved, more than the fixed cost a worker pays before it
// produces, that no deliverable is sacrificed to buy width, that two parts
// covering the same ground are one, and that the verdict is read off the
// accounting rather than off how the split reads. It rides the same two prompts
// proportionRule does, at their end, because those are where a division is
// actually decided.
const verdictRule = `A split is valid only when each part's expected parallel saving exceeds the
fixed cost a worker pays before it produces — the orientation, setup, and
delivery it owes before any work leaves it. A part that does not pay back that
cost is the same wait made more expensive, not a saving.

Do not drop a deliverable to buy parallelism. If a thing cannot be divided
without losing the whole, the whole is the part: its pieces would not stand
alone, and one of them would then owe the whole anyway.

Duplicate work is not parallelism. Two parts that each re-read or re-explain the
same subject are one part charged twice; a split counts only when each part
works on material the others do not touch.

Judge a part against the ledger, not against how reasonable the split sounds.
What decides it is what the part costs to run and what it produces — a division
that reads well but shortens no wait and lightens no one worker's load is a
division nobody owed.`

	// one fresh worker, one contract, and none of fan-out, bind, audit,
	// expansion or per-leaf briefs.
	//
	// THE SHORTCUT IS A JUDGMENT ABOUT GATES AND NEVER ONE ABOUT SIZE. It used
	// to be taken on the spine's answer alone, and the spine is asked what has to
	// wait for what — a question a piece far too large for one worker answers
	// "nothing" as honestly as a two-line errand does. So a leaf that had just
	// measured itself at 263K of a 150K window was replanned as one worker with
	// the goal as its brief, and nothing between the two runs was in a position
	// to notice. The one node is therefore sized before it is handed out, and the
	// shortcut is taken only where the ruler says it is within one worker's
	// reach; anything larger falls through to the pipeline, which is where the
	// division of a sequence lives (see sequence.go). That is one call, and it is
	// the cheapest call in the system.

		// AND A LIST FOR A REMAINDER: asked what has to wait for what, it
		// answers a remainder's finding with the steps one worker would take —
		// "Check unit tests", "Check integration test", "Verify no traceback" —
		// and three such steps are one worker's list, not three jobs. Measured
		// on the canary acceptance cell: a second remainder carrying "2
		// unexercised behaviours" came back as three stages, was never offered
		// the ruler at all, and bought fan-out, bind, sizing, audit and seven
		// contracts. So the stages are folded into the one node and the ruler is

		// ever reaches this line. THIS SHORTCUT IS ONLY EVER TAKEN FOR A
		// REMAINDER — Options.Undivided has one caller, the replan a leaf that
		// ran out of room asks for — and a remainder's words are a list of what
		// is left, which is one worker's assignment written out rather than a
		// division of it. A remainder that listed its failing tests was read as
		// six pieces and then eight, and ran as fourteen parallel repairs; the
		// door's spend doubled on the canary with quality flat. So the words are

		// would hold. The per-node question — the one with a clause about

// the part that was always the planner's — WHICH ask, and what its answer means.

// It reports only the two verdicts it can determine by itself. Whether a reply
// that parsed is actually *right* is a question only the caller can answer, so
// the slot is left open for it; a caller that never answers leaves the call
// unverified, which is the truth.
