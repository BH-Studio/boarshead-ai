// deliverable buried under meta-commentary — while the two competitors it was
// measured against always put the goods in-channel.

// owns the three surfaces that speak to whoever produces the finished whole: the
// instruction the deliverable owner receives, the working method written for it,
// and the merge a panel's results land in. Each one is a place a job can be told
// what to produce without ever being told where to put it, and each one used to
// be exactly that.
