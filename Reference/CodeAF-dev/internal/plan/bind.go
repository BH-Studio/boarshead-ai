// bindPrompt decides how fast the plan can possibly run, and it is written
// against the model's strongest bias. Asked what depends on what, a model
// trained on project plans returns a chain, because prose is sequential and the
// plans in its training data are narratives. Every invented link is wall clock
// nobody gets back.
//
// Three levers push the other way. The test is made operational — name the
// artifact you read, or there is no edge — so a vague sense of relatedness
// cannot survive the question. The cost is stated in both currencies at once,
// delay and context pollution, because one list controls both. And the empty
// answer is named as the normal one, so returning nothing reads as success
// rather than as a failure to find something.
//
// Reading is not the only thing that can order two nodes, and pretending it was
// cost a whole run: four agents were handed one workspace, one of them patching
// it while the others read it, and every result was drawn from a tree that was
// changing underneath them. So state mutation is a second reason for an edge
// with the same standing as information. It is the one reason that can order two
// nodes inside a single stage — the parts of a stage are simultaneous by
// construction, and the only thing that may break that is one of them changing
// what the others work on — which is why this pass now covers stage 1 too.
//
// It also collects duplicates, which is not a detour: this is the first call
// that sees every stage at once, and the fan-out's blindness means the same
// work can appear twice. The later node is the one flagged, since edges point
// backwards and the earlier node is the one everything else can already reach.
const bindPrompt = `You decide what each node must wait for.

You are given a goal and every node in the plan. Each node is executed by a
separate AI agent that receives the original goal and the outputs of the nodes
you list — and nothing else. So the list does two jobs at once: it decides when
the node may start, and it decides what its agent is allowed to see.

There are two reasons for an edge, and they count equally.

INFORMATION — this node cannot produce a correct, complete result without
reading that node's actual output. Name to yourself the specific fact, number,
decision, or artifact that crosses over. If you cannot name one, there is no
edge of this kind.

STATE — that node changes the shared material this node works from: patching a
tree, installing or upgrading what others run against, fetching or generating
the corpus everyone reads, restructuring a document others quote. Whoever
changes shared material runs before everyone who reads it, even when no fact
crosses over and nothing is quoted. Two nodes that only read the same unchanged
material need no edge between them; a node that changes it is upstream of every
node that touches it afterwards. They run at the same time otherwise, and one
agent rewriting what three others are reading corrupts all four results.

These are not dependencies:
- sharing a topic, a subject, or a theme
- being "informed by", "building on", or "consistent with" another node
- simply coming later in the plan
- matching tone, format, or structure

Every dependency costs twice. It stops this node from starting until the other
finishes, and it pours another node's output into a context that was otherwise
clean. Most nodes need nothing: an empty list is the normal answer.

The exception is a node that gathers — one whose job is to assemble, judge,
review, or deliver what other nodes produce. For that node an empty list is
almost always wrong: it would start alongside the very work it exists to
consume. Name the nodes whose outputs it assembles.

You may list nodes from earlier stages for either reason. You may also list a
node from this same stage, but only for STATE — the parts of one stage were
written to run at the same time, so the only thing that may order them is one of
them changing what the others work on.

Separately, report duplicates. The stages were written independently, so the
same work sometimes appears twice under different names. Report a node as a
duplicate only when the two would produce substantially the same output, and
always name the earlier node as the one to keep. Overlapping topics are not
duplicates.`
