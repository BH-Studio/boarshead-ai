// The invoice is what a split costs, in the only currency anybody can check:
// what work of this kind has already cost on this machine.
//
// Every prompt in this package that judges division states a burden of proof —
// a split has to be bought on wall time, cost and quality together — and then
// hands the model no prices with which to do the arithmetic. So the burden is
// discharged on plausibility: a division that sounds parallel sounds bought. The
// measured lines that would settle it exist and are already collected, and
// reached exactly one reader before this: nobody.
//
// This is that measurement rendered as evidence for the three decisions that
// actually divide work. It adds no rule and replaces no principle: the prompts
// keep their one burden of proof and gain a short table of numbers underneath
// it. Where there is no measurement the block is absent — never a placeholder,
// never a prior dressed as an observation — because a fabricated price is worse
// than no price at all: it is an argument the model cannot check and will not
// question.
//
// Cache shape (L7): an invoice moves every time a leaf finishes, so it is never
// part of a shared prefix. Every injection site below appends it to the tail of
// the last user message of its own call, behind everything stable — the same
// position, and for the same reason, that every other measured block takes:
// what churns sinks, so the constant above it stays a matchable prefix.

// Invoice is one worker's measured price list.
//
// It is deliberately not a model of anything. Each field is a quantile or an
// extreme of observations that were journaled as they happened; nothing here is
// fitted, extrapolated or smoothed, so every number in the rendered block is a
// thing that actually happened to a real leaf.
