// sizeAnchors is the calibration point of the whole system, and the only place
// a number about harness capacity is written down.
//
// A fixed threshold — "split above six sources" — mis-sizes everything, because
// a research node is source-heavy while a writing node touches almost nothing
// and still takes an hour. But free judgment is worse: asked whether something
// can be decomposed, a model always says yes, which is exactly the runaway we
// spent the spine prompt fighting.
//
// So the model is given a reference frame instead of a rule. Placing a task
// against three concrete examples is a comparison, which models are good at;
// estimating it in the abstract is not. And it makes recalibration tractable —
// a different model or a different harness means rewriting these three examples
// and nothing else. They are a prior today. Once an executor exists and we can
// measure how many steps a leaf really costs, they get replaced by measured
// ones, and every judgment downstream moves with them.
const sizeAnchors = `Use these three reference tasks to judge scale. They are the ruler; place the
node against them rather than estimating it on its own.

TOO SMALL — one action and one answer. Look up a single fact; rename one thing;
  correct one sentence. An agent finishes before it has finished reading the
  instruction. Work this small should have stayed part of something larger,
  because handing it over costs more than doing it.

RIGHT — one self-contained subject taken from start to finished, in one sitting.
  Profile a single named vendor from its own material and write it up; add one
  capability along with the tests that prove it works; draft one section of a
  document. Perhaps ten steps, all on one subject, one deliverable, nothing
  waiting on a decision being made elsewhere. This is the target, and most work
  should land here.

TOO BIG — several unrelated threads tangled together, or more than one
  deliverable hiding inside one instruction. Survey a whole market and recommend
  a product; rebuild a component and migrate everything that uses it and update
  the documentation. Open-ended, no natural stopping point, and an agent doing it
  alone spends most of its time on work that could have been happening at once.

Judge by the breadth of the subject, not the volume of material. A great deal of
material about one subject is RIGHT. A little material about five unrelated
subjects, or one job that quietly contains three different deliverables, is TOO
BIG. A long list of things to touch is not by itself a reason to call something
oversized.`

// sizePrompt asks where a node sits against the anchors, and states the trade-off
// in the currency that actually applies. The economics matter as much as the
// ruler: told only "is this the right size", a model optimises for tidiness,
// but told what splitting costs and what not splitting costs, it optimises for
// the thing we care about. This is the same lever that made the spine stop
// inventing stages.
//
// LinearSubharness names the worker. It is written here rather than imported
// because the ruler is a fact about the worker, and the package that describes
// the worker is the one that already imports this one; a constant repeated in
// two packages is cheaper than a cycle.
//
// It is a name, and that is load-bearing. The generalist used to be spelled as
// the empty string, which made "this node was judged and the answer is the
// generalist" indistinguishable from "nobody judged this node" — and every

// inheritance above all, read the first as the second. A verdict that was made
// says so out loud; empty is reserved for the verdict nobody made.

// obligation on the joint objective — the wait, the cost, and the answer,
// together — with exactly two things that discharge it, concurrency or a node

	return `You judge whether each node is the right size to hand to a single agent.

That agent works alone and in order: it thinks, uses one tool, sees the result,
thinks again. It cannot do two things at once. It produces one deliverable and
stops. Everything it reads stays in front of it, so it slows down as it goes.

` + anchors + `

Judge each node against those anchors:

- atomic      — close to RIGHT, or smaller. One agent should just do it.
- borderline  — larger than RIGHT, but it is not obvious that breaking it up
                would produce parts that could genuinely run at the same time.
- oversized   — clearly toward TOO BIG. Splitting it would let real work happen
                simultaneously that is currently stuck behind other work.

Weigh both costs honestly. Splitting a node costs a round of planning, an extra
result to reassemble, and whatever context each new piece must be given before
it can start — a split whose pieces must each be told the whole subject is paid
for twice and buys nothing if the pieces would just run one after another
anyway. Leaving a node too big costs an agent grinding serially through work
that had no reason to be sequential, and the person waits for the longest chain,
never the total, so a piece that carries only its own share is cheap in context
and repaid in waiting.

Judge the nodes relative to each other as well as to the anchors — you are
seeing all of them, and the largest few are what matter.

Most nodes in a well-built plan are atomic. Say so when they are.

The node stands whole until a split proves what it buys. That is the starting
position at every level and it is the answer whenever the case for dividing is
not actually made — not a last resort for when nothing better comes to mind.
Whatever is bought has to be bought on all three of the things being spent at
once: the time the person waits, what the work costs to run, and how good the
answer comes back. A division that improves none of the three is a division that
was made for its own sake.

Two things and only two things discharge that burden. Either the pieces would
genuinely run at the same time — none of them waiting on another, so the wait
becomes the longest piece instead of the sum of all of them — or the node cannot
be brought to an end inside what one worker can hold, so it would be stopped and
resumed however anyone decides. A sequence discharges neither: pieces that run
one after another land no sooner than the undivided node, and they add a
briefing for each piece and a reassembly at the end that the undivided node
never paid for.

Each piece must also be sayable more precisely than the node itself. A piece
carries a deliverable of its own and its own condition for being finished, and
both can be written down without reference to the other pieces. If the only
difference between a piece and the node is narrower wording, it is not a piece,
it is the node said again; and two pieces that would finish on the same
condition are one piece, with the second being that answer bought twice.

Say the price out loud before accepting it: every piece re-pays whatever it must
be told before it can start, every piece is one more result to reassemble, and
every piece is one more thing to schedule and wait on. What clears that price is
width that can be named — the units that stand apart, and which piece owns which
— or a named reason the node cannot converge as one job. Thoroughness never
clears it. Dividing work does not make it better, and a split made for the look
of the thing is paid for in full by the person waiting.

Also return split_into for every node:

- For an atomic node, return an empty list. Always.
- Otherwise, name the pieces the node would break into that could genuinely run
  at the same time. Each is a short label of two or three words — "Berlin
  permits", "competitor pricing" — a name, not a sentence, and never a copy of
  the node's own summary or of the things it must touch.
- Name a piece only if it is real: something an agent could work on knowing
  nothing about the others, producing a result of its own. If you would only be
  restating the node in smaller words, there are no pieces.
- Where the inside of an oversized node is a sequence, name the ordered stages it
  passes through instead — one short label each, in the order they happen. Say
  them here because this is the only place the node has to say what it is made
  of, and a node too large to be carried to an end in one sitting is divided
  whether or not anything in it runs at the same time. Nothing reads this list as
  a claim that they are simultaneous. Where you cannot name two stages either,
  the list is empty.
- Where the node's own words, or the things it says it must touch, already
  enumerate units that stand apart, the pieces are that enumeration: one unit
  each, or an even batch of them each when the units are many. Do not halve an
  enumerated set into two coarse pieces, and never name two pieces that would
  each cover the whole set — each would do all of it, and one answer would be
  paid for twice. Where the material enumerates nothing, there is no split to
  read off it.
- Name a piece only when it could be written down with a deliverable of its own
  and its own way of telling that it is finished, distinguishable from the
  node's and from every other piece's. If you would be handing the same finish
  line to two of them, there are no pieces.
- If you cannot name at least two, return an empty list. That is the answer that
  says to leave the node whole, and it is a common and correct one.`
