// Ensemble execution is the second way to spend parallelism, and it is not
// decomposition.
//
// Decomposition splits work by subject and buys speed: five agents each take a
// different city, and nothing is lost because no two of them were ever going to
// read the same page. Ensemble does the opposite. It hands the whole job to N
// agents at once, each working alone on the same material, and merges what they
// come back with. It buys no speed at all — it buys recall, and it pays N times
// the money for it.
//
// The observation behind it is a real run. Asked to review a pull request, a
// malformed plan accidentally ran five nearly-complete independent reviews and
// merged them; the merge held 8 verified defects where a single careful pass
// had found 4. Nothing about the second run was smarter. The passes simply did
// not miss the same things, because attention is what is scarce in judgment
// work and independent attention does not overlap perfectly.
//
// That makes it a general pattern with a narrow shape: one judgment over one
// body of material, where a miss is expensive and hard to notice — reviews,
// evaluations, audits, comparisons, recommendations. Everything else is
// decomposition, and running three passes over separable work just buys the
// same facts three times. So the choice is made once, deliberately, from the
// goal, and the prompt that makes it says plainly that decompose is the answer
// almost every time.
//
// Independence is the whole mechanism, which constrains the graph in one
// unusual way: the panelists must not be told about each other. A brief that
// says "another agent is covering the error paths" produces exactly the
// correlated blind spot the redundancy was bought to remove. So the panelist
// brief is written once, against a plan view that contains a single pass, and
// copied verbatim to every panelist — identical in coverage, and unaware that
// coverage is being repeated.

// ensemblePrompt makes the one judgment this file exists for.

// It is written in the style of ground.go: a single call, from the goal alone,

// implicitly. The pressure in it runs one way on purpose. Asked whether extra
// scrutiny would help, a model says yes about anything, and an ensemble is the
// most expensive answer the planner can give — so the prompt states decompose
// as the default, names the exact shapes that qualify, and prices the choice in
// the currency being spent.
//
// The panel description is folded into the same call rather than taking a
// second one. The alternative was a judgment call followed by a shaping call,
// which costs an extra serial round on the one path that has no other work to
// hide behind. The fields are ignored outright when the verdict is decompose,
// so the only risk is a model filling them in hopefully, which the prompt
// closes by telling it to leave them empty.
const ensemblePrompt = `You decide how a goal should be worked: split up, or done several times over.

Almost every goal is SPLIT UP. The work divides by subject — different cities,
files, vendors, sections, components, questions — and each part produces a
different piece of the answer. Splitting buys speed, and nothing is lost by it,
because no two parts were going to look at the same material anyway.

A few goals are not like that. The work is one judgment over one body of
material, and the answer is not made of parts: it is one verdict, one list of
findings, one recommendation about the same thing. Review this pull request.
Evaluate this proposal. Audit these accounts. Assess this design. Choose between
these two options. Grade this submission. Splitting by subject buys nothing
there, because there is only one subject.

For that shape the useful redundancy is doing the whole job several times over,
independently, and merging the results. It is not a second opinion, and not a
review of a review: every pass does the complete job alone, without seeing the
others, and what one misses another catches. On a real code review, five
independent passes found 8 verified defects where a single careful pass found 4.
Neither pass was smarter. Attention is what is scarce in judgment work, and
independent attention does not overlap perfectly.

That recall is bought with money. N passes cost N times as much as one and
finish no sooner. It is worth paying when a miss is expensive and hard to
notice — a defect that ships, a risk nobody flagged, a candidate wrongly
rejected. It is not worth paying when the work is mechanical, when a mistake
would be obvious the moment anyone looked, or when the answer can simply be
looked up.

Return "ensemble" only when all three hold:
  1. The core work is one judgment over one body of material, not several
     separable subjects.
  2. It is work where careful people disagree and miss different things —
     reviewing, evaluating, auditing, comparing, recommending.
  3. Missing something matters more than the extra spend.

Otherwise return "decompose". That is the answer for most goals, including most
goals that mention analysis or research: gathering facts about several things is
separable work, and doing it three times over buys the same facts three times.
Building something is separable work. Writing a long document is separable work.

You are also shown the ordered stages the planner drew for this goal. Treat them
as evidence. A single stage means the planner found no gate in the work at all,
which fits one body of material being judged; several stages mean the goal has
real phases, and phases are separable work.

When you return "ensemble", describe the panel as well:
- pass_title and pass_summary: the one job every pass does, identically. Write
  it as the complete job, never as a share of it — every pass covers all of the
  material and produces its own full set of findings.
- pass_sources: what that pass must touch, named concretely.
- setup_title and setup_summary: the single piece of preparation, if any, that
  puts the material in place before anyone judges it — checking out the branch,
  assembling the corpus, collecting the submissions. Leave both empty when the
  material is already at hand. "Read the thing" is not preparation.
- deliverable: what the merge finally produces, in a few words.

When you return "decompose", leave all of those empty.`

  Different consequence is a different finding, however similar the wording.
