// TEST TRAFFIC NEVER LANDS IN A PERSON'S LEDGER.
//
// The log is always on and works out its own path when nobody hands it one,
// which is exactly right for the product and exactly wrong under `go test`: a
// test binary inherits the CODEAF_HOME of whoever started it, so a package that
// streams scripted answers through a client appends its fiction to the ledger
// of the person at the keyboard. It has happened twice — 356 rows of
// `vendor/vision-model` priced at $4.25 beside one run's real rows (#286), and
// `test/model` / `cheap/one` rows the day before that — and the cost is not the
// disk space: anything that sums that file afterwards reports money nobody
// spent, and the fake vision row alone dwarfed the run it was interleaved with.
//
// So under test this package will not resolve a path it was not given. A log
// that would land in the state root the environment named is refused and the
// log is simply off; a test that WANTS one says where it goes — `Open` with a
// directory of its own, or the CODEAF_CALL_LOG pin — and gets one.
//
// THE GATE IS HERE RATHER THAN IN THE HELPERS THAT BUILD CLIENTS because a
// helper can be forgotten. `internal/provider` and `cmd/codeaf` each pin the
// log off in their own TestMain, and every other package that reaches a client
// through them did not, which is the whole defect: the fix that lives in a test
// helper protects the packages somebody remembered and no others, and a package
// written next month starts unprotected again. There is exactly one place a
// path is resolved, and a gate on it holds for tests nobody has written yet.

// profileDirEnv moves the profile — the key, the measured behaviour, and this
// log with them — out from under the state root, and it is the second root a
// test binary can inherit without asking for it. The name is spelled here
// rather than taken from internal/config, which owns it as
// config.ProfileDirEnv: config opens this log, so the import would be a cycle.
// `codeaf logs` and `codeaf doctor` spell it out for the same reason.
