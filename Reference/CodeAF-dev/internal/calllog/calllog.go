// Package calllog is codeaf's always-on record of the model calls it makes.
//
// It exists because of what debugging one used to cost. A headless run that
// sits on "still waiting" for fifteen minutes writes nothing anywhere that says
// which call is in flight, what shape it had, or how it ended, and the last
// three wire bugs — a thinking pass eating the answer ceiling on GLM 5.3,
// encrypted reasoning replayed to a model that did not produce it after a
// /model switch, a bare leaf that never filed its artifacts — were each found
// by standing a logging proxy in front of OpenRouter. A proxy is not something
// a person running codeaf on their own laptop can be asked to build, so the
// record is built in.
//
// ONE LINE PER CALL, JSON Lines, appended under a mutex. The provider adapter
// writes it, because every outbound call in the process passes through that one
// door — the chat's turn, `codeaf do`, plan briefs and contracts, the delivery
// gate, reflexes, the document route.
//
// WHAT IS NEVER IN IT: the prompts. A transcript is the person's own data and
// their own files, and a debug log that quietly accumulates it is a liability
// rather than a tool. The record carries the SHAPE of a request — how many
// messages, how many tools, which knobs, which ceiling — and the bodies only
// when someone deliberately asks for them with CODEAF_CALL_LOG_BODIES.
//
// A WRITE FAILURE IS NEVER A FAILED CALL. Anything that goes wrong here — a
// read-only home, a full disk, a path that is a directory — silences the log
// for the rest of the process and prints one line naming the path it could not
// write. A model call that failed because its log could not be written would be
// the worst possible trade for a debugging convenience.
//
// AND A ROW IS NEVER LOST OVER A VALUE. A number JSON has no spelling for — the
// wait controller's +Inf when it holds no alternative lane — is taken off the
// row and named in words on it rather than costing the row, because a row that
// vanishes is a call that reads as in flight forever (finite.go).
