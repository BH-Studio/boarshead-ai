// NUMBERS JSON CANNOT SPELL, AND WHY THEY MAY NOT COST A ROW.
//
// encoding/json has no spelling for +Inf, -Inf or NaN, and it refuses the whole
// record when one reaches it. The record it refuses is almost always an END
// row, so what is left is a start row with nothing beside it — which every
// reader of this file, a person and the manual alike, reads as a call that is
// still in flight.
//
// SO THE LOG NEVER LOSES A ROW OVER A VALUE. A number JSON cannot spell is
// taken off the record and the rest of the row is written whole.
//
// THIS IS NOW THE LAST LINE OF DEFENCE AND NOT THE ORDINARY ROAD, and that is
// the change. The wait controller used to price acting at +Inf whenever it held
// no alternative lane, and its belief answered +Inf for a wait far enough into
// the tail; both figures travelled through the watch into `cost_s` and `wait_s`
// and landed here on ordinary, healthy, one-second calls. They are
// [control.Seconds] now — a figure, or nothing, or past what a belief can price
// — and only a figure is ever written, so nothing in the request path produces
// a value for this file to rescue. What reaches it is a builder defect.
//
// AND IT SAYS NOTHING ON THE ROW ABOUT IT. It used to add a sentence naming the
// field and the float, which was the right repair while an infinity was a
// legitimate answer and is the wrong one now: under the emptiness law a row
// with no number carries NOTHING, and a row explaining a float to somebody who
// asked what happened to a model call is a program talking about its own
// arithmetic. The complaint goes to stderr, once, where a defect belongs.
//
// TAKEN OFF RATHER THAN SPELLED AS A STRING OR A NULL, because the field's type
// is what every reader of this log decodes with, today and for every row
// already written: a `cost_s` that is sometimes a number and sometimes "+Inf"
// breaks the decode of a whole file for the sake of one line of it.
