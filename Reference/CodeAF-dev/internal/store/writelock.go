// How long a write waits for the write lock, and why the wait has to be bounded
// out here rather than inside SQLite.
//
// Every write in this package is a transaction, and every transaction is
// IMMEDIATE (see [Open]'s `_txlock`): the write lock is taken at BEGIN rather
// than at the first write, so a transaction that is going to lose the race
// loses it before it has read anything and can never fail halfway through. That
// is load-bearing and stays. What was wrong was the WAIT.
//
// ── THE DRIVER IGNORES THE CONTEXT ON BEGIN ──
//
// modernc.org/sqlite's newTx runs `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` with context.Background()
// and throws the caller's context away, so `db.BeginTx(ctx, nil)` is not
// cancellable no matter what is passed to it. Measured against a held write
// lock, a BeginTx handed a 200ms context still took 10.09 seconds — the full
// busy_timeout — before it returned "database is locked". Passing a context
// here is therefore not a fix; it is a fix-shaped comment. The bound has to be
// the CALLER'S clock, kept out here where Go can see it.
//
// ── AND THE DEADLINE MUST NOT BECOME THE TRANSACTION'S ──
//
// The other obvious move is worse: hand BeginTx a context with a timeout on it
// and database/sql will roll the transaction back the moment that timeout
// fires — not the wait, the LIVE TRANSACTION, under a caller that is midway
// through writing. The deadline below bounds only the acquisition; the
// transaction it hands back is bound to nothing and ends when its caller ends
// it.

	// statements [Open] runs before there is a Store to bound anything with,
	// and the tail of an attempt this file has already abandoned.
	//
	// It is also, exactly, where the ten-second stall came from. It is left long
	// deliberately — shortening it would trade a stall for a failure to open a
	// database another process is mid-migration on — and it is no longer what
	// any caller waits for, because the bound below fires first.

	// The number is chosen against the work: an ordinary write here is one
	// appended event and one view update, sub-millisecond, so three seconds is
	// thousands of ordinary writes' worth of queue ahead of you. Past it the
	// holder is not busy, it is wedged — another process stopped inside a
	// transaction — and every second spent waiting on a wedged holder is a
	// second of a person's frozen cursor bought for nothing. Three seconds is
	// also inside the window where a person still believes the program is

// a caller that reads busy would retry a call that will break again the same
// way. It is pre-loaded into the attempt's outcome before BeginTx is called and

// hold — the write lock, to answer a question that changes nothing. With the
// flag the driver issues a plain `BEGIN`, which in WAL takes its snapshot at the
// first statement inside it and holds that snapshot until the rollback, while
// writers carry on beside it.
