// THE MEMORY SNAPSHOT: everything remembered, in one reading a page can afford.
//
// The surface that draws memory today reads it the one way a surface on a
// three-second clock cannot: `ListMemories("", 500)` on the keystroke, then a
// provenance lookup PER MEMORY — up to five hundred and one round trips before
// the frame returns. That survives behind a slash command that opens a panel
// once. It does not survive on a page in a tab bar.
//
// So this is the whole shape in a FIXED NUMBER OF STATEMENTS: two, whatever a
// person has remembered. One counts, grouped in SQLite where counting belongs;
// one carries the newest rows. Neither grows a round trip when the store does,
// which is the property the "one query, not N" rule is actually about.
//
// THE TWO STATEMENTS DESCRIBE ONE MOMENT. They run inside a single deferred read
// transaction ([Store.beginRead]), because a memory written between them would
// otherwise leave the counts describing one store and the rows describing
// another — a page saying "41 held" above a shelf of 42, which is the kind of
// wrongness nobody reports and everybody stops trusting. In WAL that snapshot
// costs nothing anybody else waits on: writers carry on beside the reader.
//
// IT IS THE FIRST READER IN THIS PACKAGE THAT SEES PAST `active`. Every other
// one — GetMemories, SearchMemories, ListMemories, MemoryIndex,
// MemoryCandidates — filters `status = active` in its own WHERE, which is right
// for a router that must not be told something the person let go of, and which
// meant that from outside this package there was no way to enumerate or even
// COUNT a forgotten memory at all. A page that says "41 let go" has to be able
// to see them.

//     memory forgotten and then restored is not counted, because it is not let
//     go of any more — the line is about what stands now, not about what
//     happened.
