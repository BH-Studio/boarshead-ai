// What one ATTEMPT at a leaf did with the room it was given, and what the next
// one was handed.
//
// THE DEFECT THESE ANSWER. On the ink run of 2026-08-29 a single node started
// five times and its store says only that: five claims, five starts, five
// releases, no reason on any of them. Reading it afterwards, four different
// things are indistinguishable — a worker that hung, a worker whose deadline
// legitimately expired, a claim taken back by the reaper, and a leaf that was
// handed its predecessor's work and chose to start over anyway. They cost the
// run nothing, one attempt, one attempt, and the entire ninety-minute wall
// respectively, and every one of them left the same silence.
//
// FAILSAFE.md's rule about absence applies exactly: a fact about the run is
// written down with its reason and its price, because an absence in the record
// is never a diagnosis, it is the diagnoses nobody can now tell apart. So the
// two facts that were missing are journaled here — an attempt that ran out of
// its own room, and a claim that picked up work already recorded — and the
// headless stream reads both (cmd/codeaf's narrateOne).
//
// Neither has a materialized view. Nothing about a node's status changes because
// an attempt was exhausted — the scheduler decides that, and it usually decides
// to retry — and rebuild's default arm deliberately ignores kinds like these, so
// the rows are durable, replayable and inert.
