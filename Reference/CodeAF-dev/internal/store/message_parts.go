// A message used to be one string, and every structured thing it needed to say
// was smuggled through that string: a question's options recovered by a brace
// scanner over the prose, a deliverable carried as its own only copy, a turn
// cut off mid-sentence journaled as if it had finished. Parts end that. A
// message body stays exactly what it was — the readable line — and beside it
// rides an ordered list of typed blocks saying what the message actually
// carries.
//
// Two of the kinds below are laws rather than conveniences:
//
//   - PartArtifact is the artifact law's carrier. Anything the person will use
//     outside the conversation is born on disk and referenced here by path.
//     Prose may describe it; prose may not BE it.
//   - PartEnded is the truncation law's carrier. A turn that ended by anything
//     other than its own completion says so here, so a half-answer cannot be
//     presented as a whole one.
//
// A message with no parts is a legacy prose message and behaves exactly as it
// always has. Nil is the normal state of this field and costs nothing to read.

// PartKind names one typed block in a message's ordered parts list. The set is
// open on purpose: a part whose kind this build does not recognize is carried
// through reads, writes and rebuilds byte for byte rather than dropped, so an
// older reader cannot silently erase a newer writer's record.
