// The verification reading, journaled.
//
// A fail-safe leaves a record that can be autopsied (FAILSAFE.md clause 4), and
// this one did not. The photograph of a project's own checks lived entirely in
// memory: the worker took it, the gate weighed it, and the run's journal held no
// row saying a reading had happened at all. Five graded runs of the 2026-08-29
// sweep were autopsied with no way to tell a project that declares no
// verification from a reading that ran and named nothing — which are the two
// opposite diagnoses, and the whole sweep turned on which of them it was.
//
// So the reading is an event. It says which command actually ran, how it was
// read, what it exited with, and how many identities it named — the four facts
// that separate "nobody looked", "the runner was asked the wrong way", "the
// suite is red" and "the suite is green".
