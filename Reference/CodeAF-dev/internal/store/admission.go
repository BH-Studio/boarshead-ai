// Admission control at the funnel door.
//
// This guard used to live in the head's spawn tool, which meant it protected
// exactly one caller: the conversation. Everything else that can commission
// work — `codeaf do` running headless, a question answered into a continuation,
// a surface with its own composer — journaled twins freely, and the person paid
// for both. The funnel is the one seam between asking for work and getting it
// (the August 2026 chat-simplification audit, no longer in the tree, §2.5), so
// the duplicate check belongs on this side of it.
//
// The window it guards is real: a splice sits pending for as long as the
// workforce takes to reach it, and every re-ask inside that window is a re-ask
// that could honestly believe the work does not exist yet. The live case that
// wrote it (2026-08-11) was "get me a list of X", then a minute later "ok start
// it" — two identical twenty-stock runs, two plans, two bills.

// pendingSpliceRead bounds the pending read. A session with more than this many
// splices waiting has a stalled workforce, and the guard degrades to catching
// the newest of them — which is the one a re-ask would twin.
