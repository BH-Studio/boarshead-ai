// The store's driver is modernc's pure-Go SQLite, and handing it a statement as
// a string means it tokenizes, parses and plans that string again — every time.
// For a read taken once per open that cost is invisible. For the handful of
// reads the resident takes at 2Hz forever, and for the mailbox poll every leaf
// takes at every turn boundary, it is most of what the read costs at all: the
// planner work does not shrink because the answer is empty.
//
// So the hottest read statements are prepared once and kept. The cache is keyed
// by the SQL text rather than by a field per statement because several of these
// reads compose their SQL from a fixed set of clauses — [Store.queryNodesLimitOrdered]
// is one statement per call site — and a map keyed by the finished text names
// exactly those variants without anyone having to enumerate them. The set is
// bounded by the code that builds it, so the map cannot grow without a new call
// site being written.
//
// database/sql owns the hard part: a *sql.Stmt re-prepares itself on whichever
// pooled connection it lands on, so nothing here has to reason about connection
// lifetime. A statement that will not prepare is not an error — the caller falls
// back to the unprepared path and gets the same answer more slowly.
