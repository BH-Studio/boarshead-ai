// that never had to.
//
// FAILSAFE.md clause 4: a fail-safe that fires without leaving a record is a
// fail-safe nobody can autopsy, and clause 3: a fact that changes what somebody
// watching should expect is a line in the stream. Both are about the same events
// — a structured answer cut off at the output ceiling and continued, one asked
// again because it came back as prose, one given up on. Every one of them costs
// money, changes how long the run takes, and is the first thing anyone reading a
// $0.50 run's autopsy wants to know about.
//
// EventStructuredRepair is declared here rather than in store.go's block for the
// reason EventJobGrowth is: a kind whose payload one file understands is easier
// to keep honest next to that file.

// it, written by the seam and kept verbatim, so a reader of the journal and a
// person watching the stream are looking at the same words rather than at two
// renderings of one fact that will eventually disagree.

// treat a failure as a note: a repair that could not be written down is not a
