// The leaf transcript: what a worker actually did, turn by turn.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS ANSWERS. A headless `codeaf do` leaf ran the bare executor
// for one node and billed 1,292,313 prompt tokens, 14,316 completion tokens and
// fifty cents against it. It left no file on disk and no record of a single
// turn: internal/exec/bare's loop kept its messages in memory and dropped them
// when the process exited, so the only rows the graph held under that node were
// the harness's own progress lines — "reading the request", "starting the
// work". A run that cannot be read back is a run nobody can learn from, and
// half a dollar is not a rounding error.
//
// WHY THIS IS A SECOND TABLE AND NOT MORE ROWS IN messages. It is the same
// judgement usage_turns.go made about the usage table, for the same reason, and
// the reason is worth spelling out because "just post them as messages" is the
// obvious answer and it is wrong.
//
// The messages table is the CONVERSATION, and a message anchored to a node is
// read by half a dozen callers who each mean "what was said about this work":
// a running leaf's steering mailbox (cmd/codeaf/chat.go), the pickup bank that
// reconstructs a re-claimed leaf's progress from its own record
// (internal/resident/bank.go, which pages the first 400 rows), the narrator,
// the missed-direction sweep (internal/resident/redirect.go), the node lens
// (internal/head/lens.go) and both TUIs' node trails. A leaf that emitted an
// assistant turn, three tool calls and three tool results per turn would put
// several hundred rows under its own node, and every one of those readers would
// have silently begun reading the worker's internal monologue as conversation —
// the bank's window filled with tool arguments, the trail a person opens
// rendering a file dump. None of them would have been changed to say so.
//
// So the conversation stays exactly what it was, byte for byte, and the shape
// underneath it lands here. The journal is still the truth: one event per flush
// carrying that flush's entries, projected into this table on write and on
// rebuild.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT internal/exec/trace.go. That file is the OTHER recorder — a
// prose flight recorder the generalist writes to `.codeaf/trace/<leaf>.trace.log`
// inside the job's workspace, with per-turn cache ratios a benchmark asserts on.
// It is the right tool for reading over a running leaf's shoulder and the wrong
// one for the failure above, for two reasons: the bare executor never wired
// itself to it, and — decisively — it lives in a directory that goes away with
// the job. A record that survives only while the scratch space does cannot
// answer "what did that node do last week", which is the question a $0.50 leaf
// leaves behind. The two are complements: the file is verbose and local, this
// is bounded and durable, and neither is a copy of the other.
//
// HOW TO READ ONE BACK. `codeaf why <node-id> --db <path>` prints it. In SQL:
//
//	SELECT turn, kind, tool, body FROM transcript
//	WHERE node_id = ? ORDER BY seq, idx;
//
// seq orders the flushes (and therefore the attempts — a retried leaf appends a
// fresh run behind the failed one), idx orders the entries within a flush.

// TranscriptKind names one entry in a leaf's record. The four that carry the
// loop are assistant / tool_call / tool_result / fault; the two that carry the
// harness's own voice are note and elided.
