// DeliveryGate is the final judge's evidence about one job. Pass is the first
// delivery's result; Gap names what it missed; PolishClosed says whether the
// single permitted repair was subsequently judged complete.
//
// The last fields are the gap ledger, and they are fields on this event rather
// than a second event kind because every reader of a job's judgement already
// reads this one. Quotes are the spans of the user's verbatim request the gap
// was said to be a failure of, and Quote is those spans as the one line a
// person reads; Round is which round of repair it was weighed for; Extended
// says the job actually grew work to close it; Refused names, in the words the
// user would be told, why it did not. A citation that was extended on is spent
// — the same words may not buy a second round — so the ledger that bounds the
// loop is exactly what replays out of the journal.
//
// Quotes is a list because a gap may be a failure of several things at once:
// the mechanical half of the gate names one citation per file the plan promised
// and the disk does not hold. Quote stays, holding the same citations joined,
// because it is what every existing reader and every already-written journal
// row has — see Cited, which is how the ledger reads either.
//
// Mechanical distinguishes those two halves, and it is recorded rather than
// inferred because the exit code depends on it. A refused gap from a model
// judge is the gate being wrong; a refused gap from the mechanical half is a
// file that is still not on disk, and no refusal of a citation makes it appear.

	//
	// The pair is what makes a finding comparable ACROSS ROUNDS, and until it
	// existed the only identity a finding had was its sentence — with a bounded
	// list of names glued into the middle, so one finding raised over two
	// different tails read as two. happy-dom's v4-flash s13 raised the identical
	// removed-checks finding on four consecutive rounds, each round bought a
	// repair, no repair could close it, and no reader of this event could say
	// the four were one thing (2026-08-29, bench/deepswe).
	Finding string `json:"finding,omitempty"`

	// Unclosed says the gap STANDS: the repair that would have closed it was
	// never bought, so nothing ran and nothing about the shortfall changed.
	//
	// It is the distinction the exit code turns on, and it is recorded rather
	// than read out of the refusal sentence because those are two categorically
	// different refusals wearing the same field. A gap refused as ungrounded, or
	// as one somebody already paid to close, is the GATE being wrong and caught
	// at it — the deliverable stands whole. A gap whose repair a governor would
	// not fund, or that nothing could plan, is the gate being RIGHT and
	// unaffordable: the thing it named is still missing, and a run that hands
	// that over is handing over less than it promised. One measured run shipped
	// "Deliverable is empty - contains no implementation" over exit 0 because
	// the two were one field (2026-08-28, meta/muse-spark-1.1).
	Unclosed bool `json:"unclosed,omitempty"`

	// Unjudged says NOBODY EVER READ THIS DELIVERY. The gate was asked and could
	// not be reached — a dead route, a refused account, a service that was down —
	// so the work shipped with no verdict behind it at all.
	//
	// It is a field of its own beside Refused because the two refusals it
	// separates are what a battery comparing runs has to tell apart. `{Refused,
	// Unclosed}` on its own is the gate that was NEVER ASKED: the harness stopped
	// spending once nothing was changing, and declined to buy a judgement. This
	// one was asked, twice where the wall allowed it, and the answer never came
	// back. A run that declined to check and a run whose checker was unreachable
	// are different facts about the same missing verdict, and a rig that reads
	// one row for both learns nothing from either.
	//
	// It was measured costing two graded runs their whole meaning. reef-145's
	// repair leaf finished its work, both of the gate's calls were refused 404,
	// the door ended `ok` at exit 0, and the store held no gate row for the
	// delivered leaf at all — so the rig compared an unchecked delivery against
	// runs that had been judged and read it as a clean pass (2026-09-02,
	// codeaf-14 anchor 1; #514). Whole below spends it, so the exit code
	// cannot report a delivery nobody read as one that stands.
	Unjudged bool `json:"unjudged,omitempty"`

	// Overturned says the refusal was CHECKED AGAINST THE WORLD and the finding
	// lost: the file the review says is missing is on disk under the name the
	// request used, or the things it says are absent are in the delivered text.
	//
	// It is the other half of the distinction Unclosed opened, and it is the one
	// the exit code should have been reading all along. Refused holds refusals
	// of two categorically different kinds. One looks at the filesystem or at
	// the deliverable and finds the review wrong — that acquits, and charging it
	// a non-zero code would teach a harness to distrust the gate's own
	// corrections. The other looks only at where the review's words came from
	// and declines to BUY a round; it settles nothing about whether the work
	// landed, because no ruling on a citation makes missing work appear.
	//
	// Recorded rather than inferred from the sentence, for the reason every
	// other field here is: the exit code turns on it, and a sentence is not a
	// field. Seven of eight measured runs exited 0 over a provenance refusal
	// while the review that named the missing work was right every time
	// (2026-08-28, bench/deepswe; see docs/design/gate/SETTLEMENT.md §2).
	//
	// THE WORLD IS THE DISK, A READING, OR THE RECORD — NEVER THE DELIVERABLE'S
	// OWN PROSE. The deliverable is the component the gate is checking, and a
	// refusal that reads it is FAILSAFE clause 2 broken in the strict sense the
	// clause states it. One measured run set this field because the words of the
	// request appeared in a summary the worker had written about work it had not
	// done, and shipped 1 of 20 hidden checks over exit 0 (2026-08-29,
	// bench/deepswe textual s5; SETTLEMENT.md §6). The delivered text may settle
	// a finding only where it IS the whole of what the run left behind — a
	// question answered in prose, whose message is its own artifact.
	Overturned bool `json:"overturned,omitempty"`

	// Unmoved says the repair round that was judged here LEFT THE TREE EXACTLY AS
	// THE FINDING FOUND IT: same files, same sizes, same modification times, stamped
	// on either side of the round.
	//
	// It is recorded because it is the fact that explains a PolishClosed which is
	// absent — and, on the runs that made this necessary, one which is present and
	// should not have been. A composed repair (revision.Compose) rewrites the
	// account of work that already landed and runs nothing, so it cannot change what
	// the world says; ink s5 and ofetch s5 both composed a better summary over a
	// finding about the substance of the work, were re-judged on the summary, and
	// settled whole at 7 of 25 and 44 of 47 hidden checks (2026-08-29,
	// bench/deepswe; docs/design/gate/SETTLEMENT.md §8).
	//
	// A round that moved nothing may still close a finding whose only ground was the
	// delivered text — that is what writing can honestly fix — so this is a fact

	// reader. igel s6 journaled the mapping and never the finding: the gate event
	// carried "exercises: 17 rows, 3 unmapped" and the coverage gap survived only
	// as a paragraph inside `gap`, where the stream's own line — firstLine(gap) —
	// could not reach it and no repair round was ever aimed at it.

	// It is a finding of its own beside Unexercised because the two are answered
	// by different evidence and a repair round is aimed at them differently.
	// Unexercised says write a check; this says the check you wrote runs the
	// behaviour and asserts nothing about it, and names which identifier to
	// assert on. textual s13's gate had said `no check exercises:
	// RichLog.write(expand=True) …` in round one; round two wrote a check that
	// called `write("short", expand=True)` and asserted `len(lines) > 0`, the
	// mapping paired the two, and the run passed at exit 0 with the hidden check
	// for that behaviour red.

	// OwnFailing is the checks THIS WORK WROTE that are red: names the baseline
	// roster never held, so nothing that was working stopped.

	// gate read `This work broke checks that were passing before it:
	// IntersectionObserver initial observation queuing …` over eighteen checks
	// the run had written that hour, on a tree the grader scored 9 of 9. A run

	OwnFailing []string `json:"own_failing,omitempty"`

	// question further back. Consumers is a name that exists and no longer
	// answers to how it is used; this is a name that does not exist at all —
