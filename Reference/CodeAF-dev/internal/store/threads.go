// Threads are sessions, admitted (the August 2026 chat-simplification audit,
// no longer in the tree, Part 5). The primitive has been
// here all along — a room row, per-room head cursors, delivery routed to the
// room that commissioned the work — and what was missing was the product's
// admission that a room is a WORKING CONVERSATION: alive for days, commissioning
// tasks along the way, taking their results back, resumable after weeks.
//
// This file is the store's half of that admission, and it is deliberately three
// small things rather than a new table:
//
//   - NewSessionID, so there is exactly one generator for a room's name and the
//     head can mint one without importing the surface that used to own it.
//   - SessionNodes, the read that answers "what did this conversation
//     commission", which nothing could answer before: nodes.session_id has
//     carried the commissioning room since splices were journaled, and every
//     caller filtered it in Go after reading the whole graph.
//   - OpenThreads, the one reader behind both the head's alive glance and the
//     surface's board home. Per the one-renderer law the QUERY lives here and
//     the wording lives in whoever is speaking, so the two halves of the product
//     cannot come to disagree about which conversations are still alive.
//
// Nothing here is a lifecycle. A thread never closes: it goes quiet, sinks out
// of the open list, and stays reachable forever by recall.

// NewSessionID mints a fresh room id. It is random rather than sequential
// because a room id is a name, not an order: two windows opened in the same
// second must not collide, and nothing downstream reads it as a number.
//
// It lives in the store because a room is a store concept and both the surface
// that opens one by key press and the head that opens one by splitting a
// conversation need the same generator. Two spellings of "a new room's name"
// is how two builds come to disagree about what a room id looks like.
