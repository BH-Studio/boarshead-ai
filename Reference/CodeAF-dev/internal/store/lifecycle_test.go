// The probe's assembler reached done while the second researcher was still
// running, shipped a brief with that country's section invented, and the person
// was told all three had been pulled together. The edges were the thing that
// went missing there — the layout that admitted those four nodes recorded none
// — so this pins the other half: wherever the inputs ARE recorded, no caller,
// no ordering, no race and no retry may start a node while one of them is still
// live. It is a property of the write, not of the queue that leads to it, which
// is why both the offer and the claim are checked and why the claim is tried
// directly rather than through anything that reads Ready first.
