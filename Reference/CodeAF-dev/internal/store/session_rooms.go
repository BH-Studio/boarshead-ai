// Rooms as places, and the three reads a surface needs to keep them honest.
//
// The sessions table above is a projection of every room that has ever been
// named, which is exactly right for a list and exactly wrong for the two
// questions a window asks at launch: WHICH room am I coming back to, and which
// of these rooms is a room at all. A launch that could not answer the first
// minted a fresh id every time it opened; a `+ new room` that could not answer
// the second minted a second empty room on top of the empty room already
// standing there. Five "untitled room" rows is what those two questions look
// like unanswered — not a naming failure, a MINTING failure (the August 2026
// rail-room audit, no longer in the tree, A2; design-law-v2 §2: "launch resumes
// the last thread; empty rooms are reused/reaped").
//
// All three reads are here rather than in the caller because all three are one
// query each and none of them is a policy: what a room is, whether anybody has
// spoken in it, and which one was spoken in last are facts the journal already
// holds.

// sessionDiscardedPayload is a room being taken back on the wire — one that was
// opened, never spoken in, and never named.
//
// It carries the id alone. There is no reason field: the only condition under
// which a room may be discarded is the one ReapEmptySessions checks, so a
// reason would be a sentence restating the rule that let the event be written.

// LatestSession names the room a launch comes back to.
//
// The honest answer is "the room the PERSON was last in", and the journal has
// two candidates for it that disagree in exactly one case. The newest session
// row by activity is the wrong one: a job delivering at 03:00 into the room
// that commissioned it raises that room's activity mark, and coming back to
// that room the next morning would be the machine deciding where the
// conversation continues. The newest USER message is the right one — a room a
// person spoke in last is the conversation they were having, whether they left
// it by switching rooms in the window or by closing the lid.
//
// The fallback below it is for a store with rooms and no words in any of them:
// the newest row by activity, so a launch that follows an opened-but-unspoken
// room still comes back to it rather than opening a second one beside it.
//
// False means there is no room to come back to at all, which is only true of a
// journal nobody has ever spoken into. A caller mints then, and only then.
