// The roles table is where the model economics of the whole system finally has
// one home. Before it, "which model does this" was answered in five different
// places — a flag, an environment variable, a preference file, a node column, a
// slot on a live client — and none of them could be asked a question by anybody
// else. This file is the answer to the question, journaled, and nothing more:
// bindings are storage, the chip is the only surface (5.10 / 8.2.16).
//
// THE ROLE LADDER (5.23, five roles, no more):
//
//	orchestrate  the voice     head and task-orchestrator turns      mid
//	plan         the architect compile, replan, graph revision       high
//	work         the hands     worker and executor turns             mid-high
//	verify       the skeptic   gates, judges, verify-then-escalate   cheap
//	scribe       the clerk     labels, titles, folds, briefs         ultra-cheap
//
// THE ORDERING LAW, which every consumer of this table cites and obeys:
// DETERMINISTIC FIRST, SCRIBE SECOND, FRONTIER LAST. Receipts, counts, states,
// and anything a template can say stay templates — free beats ultra-cheap, and
// a role binding is not a licence to spend a model on arithmetic. Scribe takes
// the prose-shaped one-liners. Verify runs before any escalation, because
// verify-then-escalate beat probing when it was measured. Frontier tiers are
// reserved for judgment. A sixth role needs the design doc amended before it
// needs code.
//
// Vision stays a capability flag resolved inside a role, not a role. Reasoning
// effort has no axis of its own here either: it is encoded in the model slug
// the catalog accepts (12.3.5), so a binding's value is exactly one string and
// inventing a second axis is a change to the doc before it is a change to this
// file.
//
// Nothing about the table is automatic. A binding takes effect at the next
// provider call of whatever reads it, silent downgrades are forbidden by the
// predictability law, and with no bindings at all every resolution in this file
// answers exactly what the system answered before the table existed.

// EventRoleBindingSet records one role binding decision, or — carrying Cleared
// — its removal. It is journaled against the node the scope names so an
// indexed reader can find a scope's history without scanning; a global binding
// names no node, exactly as a message names none.
