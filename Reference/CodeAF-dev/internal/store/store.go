// modernc.org/sqlite renders that code as `unable to open database file: out of
// memory (14)`. Nothing has run out of memory. A person who reads it goes
// hunting for a leak on a machine with fifty gigabytes free, and the actual
// cause — a missing folder — is nowhere in the sentence.
//
// So the path is asked about a second time, using the operating system's own
// open, which answers in words: `permission denied`, `read-only file system`,
