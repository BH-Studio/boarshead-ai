// Usage accounting lives in the same journal as the work it measures. One
// event per executed node, materialized into a running total, so any lens can
// answer "what has this graph cost" without replaying history.

// NodeUsage is what one node's execution spent.
//
// Model is the model that actually served the call, which is not the model
// anybody asked for: an escalation moves a leaf to a stronger rung, a cascade
// picks by class, and the only durable record of who did the work used to be
// Provenance.WorkModel — the pin the user requested, empty on almost every job.
// So "which model wrote this?" was unanswerable from every surface. It is
// recorded here rather than on the node because a node can run more than once
// and each run has its own answer, and because the row that carries the money
// is the row that should carry the name.
//
// CachedTokens is the part of PromptTokens the provider billed at the cached
// rate. It was computed in three places and persisted in none, which is not a
// missing nicety: it is the reason a whole class of defect went unnoticed. The
// harness spends real effort on cache shape — a byte-stable prefix, decay that
// fires in batches so most turns leave the transcript untouched, a tool block
// that never moves — and a run key that was never set produces exactly the same
// journal as a run whose prefix was perfect. The number that separates them is
// this one, and until it was written down nobody could tell the two apart.

//     whose node names this room is exact — no window, no guess, no double

//   - The head's OWN calls — routing a message, compiling an instruction,
//     writing the reply — bill the spine, which belongs to no room at all
//     (pool.SpendNode defaults to RootID for precisely that reason). Nothing
//     in the row says which room was being answered. Only the window says it,
//     and only while one room is talking.
//

	//
	// Where it stops being exact: three call sites journal ONE spine row for
	// MANY calls, summing their prompts — the planner's passes
	// (journalPlanSpend) and headless preparation and run totals. A summed
	// prompt is not a context occupancy, so a window containing one of those
	// makes this an upper bound. That is the safe direction for a health signal

	// dumber" — but it is an error and it is written down here rather than
	// dressed up at the seam.
	//
	// It is deliberately measured over Spine alone. A leaf's row is a whole
