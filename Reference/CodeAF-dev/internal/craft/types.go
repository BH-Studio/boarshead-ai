// Package craft is codeaf's learned know-how: workflows, skills, verifiers,
// and exemplars, versioned in a git repository the resident owns. A workflow
// is a reusable job-shape written by the distiller from experience — never by
// hand into the binary — and refined across versions whose survival is
// measured like any other belief.
//
// The execution model is deliberately not a second engine. A workflow COMPILES
// into an ordinary graph subtree: steps are leaves, needs are edges, fan-out
// unrolls at runtime through the revision sentinel, and a failed verifier
// earns another bounded round the same way — a sentinel re-splice. Because
// every step is a normal node in the event-sourced store, persistence, resume
// after a crash, cost accounting, steering, surgery, the load governor, and
// the provider rate limiter are all inherited rather than reimplemented. LLM
// access is the same in-process clients every other leaf uses, sharing one
// cache lineage per run.
//
// The control layer is data, not code: a workflow file may declare shape and
// bounds but can never loop unboundedly, recurse into another workflow, or
// grant itself more budget than the package ceilings below. Intelligence
// lives in the step briefs; the file only arranges them.
