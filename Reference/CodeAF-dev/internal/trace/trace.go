// Package trace is the record of everything one run did, kept only when
// somebody asked for it.
//
// It exists because of what debugging a bad turn costs today. The model-call
// log beside it (internal/calllog) is the INDEX: one line per call, always on,
// small enough to grep, and deliberately holding none of the person's own
// words. That is the right shape for "which call was slow" and the wrong shape
// for "what exactly did we send, and what exactly came back" — the question
// somebody has after a reply that made no sense, a tool that refused, or a
// route that went somewhere they did not expect. Answering that needs bodies,
// and bodies do not belong in a file that is always on and rotates at 32 MB,
// where one long turn evicts the failure the person came for.
//
// So: ONE SWITCH, ONE FOLDER PER RUN, AND NOTHING WRITTEN WHEN IT IS OFF. The
// switch has three doors — the environment pin CODEAF_DEBUG, a --debug flag on
// chat, do and exec, and /debug inside a conversation — and when none of them
// was used, [For] returns nil after two atomic loads and every method on that
// nil recorder is a no-op. A feeder site therefore costs one call and one nil
// check on the runs nobody is debugging, which is what lets the feeders sit on
// the hot path at all.
//
// THE THREE DOORS MEAN THE SAME RECORD AND NOT THE SAME SCOPE, and the run id
// on the context is what draws the line. The pin and the flag were handed to
// THIS PROCESS on purpose, so they turn the record on process-wide ([Enable]):
// every run the process opens is recorded, each into its own folder. /debug was
// typed inside ONE conversation, and a process can hold several — an engine
// host holds one per person sitting in front of it — so it turns the record on
// for that run and no other ([EnableRun]). A switch that could not tell them
// apart would land one person's prompts, files and replies in a folder somebody
// else asked for, which is the one thing a record of a person's own data may
// never do.
//
// THE RECORD IS A PERSON'S OWN DATA. It holds their prompts, their files and
// the model's whole reply, so it lives under the state root and nowhere else,
// its folder is 0700 and its files 0600, and no authorization header or key
// value is ever written into it ([Scrub]). A run keeps its own folder, named by
// a run id that every record in it carries, and old folders are pruned WHOLE
// (see [KeepRuns]) — never a rotation inside a run, because a rotation inside a
// run is exactly how the failure being investigated gets deleted mid-run.
//
// A WRITE FAILURE IS NEVER A FAILED RUN. Everything here follows calllog's
// discipline: a full disk, a read-only home or a path that is a directory
// silences this run's recorder after ONE line on stderr naming the path, and
// the run carries on exactly as it would have with the switch off.
