// captured at all — so in the ordinary case there is nothing to redact. Scrub
// is defensive rather than corrective: a provider that echoes its own
// authorization back in an error object, a tool result that quotes a curl
// command, and a request an adapter one day builds with its credentials inside
// the body are all things a person would only discover by finding their key in
// a file they were about to attach to a bug report.
//
// So every string and every body written by this package passes through here
// first, and what it finds becomes the word "[redacted]" — which is a word
// somebody reading the record can search for, unlike an elision.

// in a person's own prompts and the model's replies into `[redacted]`, and a
