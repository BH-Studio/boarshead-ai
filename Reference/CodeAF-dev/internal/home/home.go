// Package home resolves the one directory codeaf owns: its state root.
//
// Everything durable the resident keeps — the journal, the workspace, the CAS,
// the craft repo, measured profiles, the model catalog, the router ledger, the
// promoted skills shelf — lives under a single directory so that "where does
// codeaf keep my things" has exactly one answer. That answer is ~/.codeaf, and
// CODEAF_HOME moves it wholesale.
//
// The override exists for the same reason the directory exists: a disposable
// run — the UX suite driving the real binary, a second brain on the same
// laptop, a sandbox — must be able to move every file codeaf writes without
// moving the user's HOME, and without a per-file flag for each of them. Narrow
// overrides that already exist (chat --db, CODEAF_PROFILE_DIR) still win where
// they apply; this only changes the default they fall back to.
