// Package wirelog counts what the surface actually puts on the wire.
//
// A TUI over SSH is not slow because it renders slowly. It is slow because
// every frame it renders becomes bytes on a link with a round trip in it, and
// nobody who has ever tuned one could say from memory how many bytes a second
// of streaming costs, or whether an idle prompt costs anything at all. This
// package answers that with a number instead of a hunch: it wraps the writer
// the terminal program paints through, counts bytes and write calls, and
// appends one line per second to a file.
//
// It is a DEVELOPER'S instrument and nothing else. There is no settings row,
// no flag and no slash command, because there is no question a person using
// codeaf would ask that this answers — the audience is whoever is holding the
// SSH story and needs to know whether a change made it cheaper. It turns on
// only when CODEAF_WIRE_LOG names a file, and when it does not, the surface
// never learns it exists: [FromEnv] returns a nil *Meter, the caller leaves
// the output writer nil, and Bubble Tea paints straight into os.Stdout exactly
// as it did before. The cost of the meter when it is off is one LookupEnv at
// boot.
//
// The log is deliberately dumb — four space-separated integers per line, one
// line per wall-clock second, silent seconds included as zeros so a reader can
// tell "nothing was drawn" from "the process was gone":
//
//	# unix_ms bytes writes total_bytes
//	1755400000000 41230 60 41230
//	1755400001000 0 0 41230
//
// A second's bytes and writes are what left the program during THAT second;
// total_bytes is cumulative since the meter opened. Seconds are wall-clock
// seconds and not "seconds since start" so that a harness driving the surface
// from outside can line its own phase boundaries up against them without the
// two sides having to agree on when zero was.
