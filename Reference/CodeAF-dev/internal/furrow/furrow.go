// Package furrow is codeaf's seam onto `furrow`, a separate program codeaf
// carries inside itself (Agent-Field, Apache-2.0,
// https://github.com/Agent-Field/furrow).
//
// furrow copy-on-write forks a whole workspace — files, dependencies, `.env`,
// the dev database, git's own mutable state — into byte-exact universes in
// about a second, seals that workspace continuously into an immutable
// content-addressed timeline, and syncs it between machines encrypted below the
// transport. It is Rust and codeaf is Go, so THE ONLY INTEGRATION IS THE CLI —
// which is fine, because the CLI is furrow's declared API: `--json` everywhere,
// stable IDs, and destructive operations gated on an explicit ID plus `--yes`.
//
// EVERY codeaf IS A codeaf WITH FURROW. The binary rides inside this one and
// is written out on first need (internal/furrowbin), so the half of the answer
// that used to vary by machine — is furrow installed — no longer does. What
// still varies is the half a person controls per project: a folder nobody ran
// `furrow watch` in is a folder furrow will not act on.
//
// THE LAW THIS WHOLE PACKAGE IS WRITTEN TO IS THE CODEBASE'S OWN: A CAPABILITY
// THAT CANNOT WORK IS ABSENT, NOT BROKEN. A folder furrow was never pointed at
// — or the rare machine where the binary could not be written out at all — and
// [Tools] returns nothing at all: the model is never handed a verb whose every
// call would be a refusal, and no other part of codeaf notices this package
// exists. Everything here hangs off [Detect], which is why [Detect] is the
// first thing in the file and the most carefully cached: it is asked far more
// often than anything else is done.
//
// It is also written to be wrong about furrow safely. furrow's JSON is furrow's
// to change, and a version this package has never seen must degrade to "I could
// not read that" rather than to a panic or, worse, to a confident misreading of
// a restore. So every decode takes the few fields it needs and ignores the
// rest, every optional field is treated as optional, and no exit code is
// trusted over a document that parsed (see [run]).
