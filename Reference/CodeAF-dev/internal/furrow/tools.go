// The four verbs furrow puts on the belt, and the one line that decides whether
// any of them are there.
//
// THEY ARE CONDITIONAL ON SOMETHING NO CONFIGURATION CAN FIX: whether this
// folder has been attached with `furrow watch`. The binary itself is no longer
// in question — codeaf carries furrow inside it (internal/furrowbin) — so the
// half that used to vary by machine does not, and the half that remains is the
// one a person decides per project. A belt is a promise, though: every tool on
// it is something the model has been told it can do, and a `workspace_restore`
// that answers "this repository is not watched" costs the model a call, reads
// as temporary, and stays in its plan for the rest of the turn. A model that
// was never told about these simply says the files cannot be put back, which is
// true and free.
//
// The names all begin `workspace_` for a second reason, and it is not tidiness.
// codeaf already has a rewind, and it is an edit of the CONVERSATION that
// deliberately touches nothing on disk (internal/session/rewind.go). These move
// the folder. A model holding both must never confuse them, so the two families
// do not share a word: one is rewind, the other is workspace_restore.
