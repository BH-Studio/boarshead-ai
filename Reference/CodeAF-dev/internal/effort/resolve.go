// ── the resolver ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ONE LADDER, ONE RESOLVER, ONE PLACE EFFORT COMES FROM.
//
// Every model call in this process asks [Resolve] how hard to think, and a
// spawn site that decides for itself is a defect however sensible its guess is.
// The reason is not tidiness: a person who dials a rung expects it to be the
// rung, and a call that quietly kept its own answer is a knob that does nothing
// with no way to tell from the outside.

// Role is what the call is FOR, and it is the rung of last resort: the answer
// when nobody has said anything more specific.
//
// It exists because the honest default is not one number. A person's turn and
// the work they handed out deserve the depth they configured; the machinery that
// runs while nobody is watching does not, and a sentinel deliberating for a
// minute over "has CI gone red" is money spent on a yes-or-no.

	// work the person handed out, which is their work at one remove and gets
	// their depth.
	RoleWorker Role = "worker"

	// RoleWork is a task worker on the bash belt (internal/session's
	// bashbelt.go): the same work at one remove as [RoleWorker], but on a belt
	// whose one action per response spends the worker's depth again on every
	// round of a run. The seat holds a floor of [Low], so the depth the person
	// configured is not paid several times over for the same thinking; a rung
	// set on the task, the conversation or the turn still outranks it.
	RoleWork Role = "work"

	// RoleErrand is the session's own housekeeping: naming a conversation,
	// summarising it, judging a route. THE PERSON'S DIAL IS NOT SPENT ON THESE
	// and neither is a default — a rung somebody set so their question would be
	// thought about would be an odd thing to spend on titling it.
	RoleErrand Role = "errand"

	// RoleStanding is one firing of a standing item, running unattended. It
	// carries no floor of its own: what keeps a firing from inheriting a depth
	// nobody meant it to have is that the conversation's dial does not reach it
	// (see [roleFloor]).
	RoleStanding Role = "standing"

	// RoleSentinel is the yes-or-no in front of a firing: has the thing the
	// person asked about happened? It is a judgment on evidence already
	// gathered and it runs on every check of every item forever — so the item's
	// own rung is the only thing that ever asks it to think, and an item that
	// asked for nothing sends nothing.
	RoleSentinel Role = "sentinel"

// roleFloor is the rung a role falls back to when nothing above it was set.
//
// A ROLE MISSING FROM THIS MAP FALLS THROUGH TO THE INSTALL'S DEFAULT, which is
// where every role but two now lands: chat, worker, standing and sentinel all
// answer "whatever the person configured", and an install that configured
// nothing asks for nothing.
//
// STANDING AND SENTINEL USED TO SIT AT [Low], and that entry is the reason this
// comment is longer than the map. The argument for it was real — a check that
// runs unattended, on a schedule, forever should not inherit a deep pass
// somebody dialled in a conversation months ago — but the mechanism was wrong
// in both directions. It was a rung this harness CHOSE, so an install that had
// asked for nothing still sent `reasoning: {effort: "low"}` on every firing of
// every item, to models whose own defaults it knew nothing about; and it was a
// floor rather than a cap, so on a model that thinks less than "low" by default
// it bought deliberation nobody wanted. The half of it that was worth keeping
// is kept where it belongs and by a different mechanism: a standing run does
// not inherit the conversation's dial at all (internal/session's standing_run.go
// sets DefaultEffort to None), so the only rung that reaches a firing is the one
// written on the item's own card.
//
// ERRAND STAYS, and it is the one entry that is not a choice about depth: [None]
// is ABSENCE, the one value that puts no field on the wire. It says the person's
// dial is not spent on naming their own conversation — never that this harness
// has an opinion about how hard a title should be thought about.
//
// WORK IS THE OTHER, and it is a choice about depth: a task worker on the bash
// belt walks its work as a run of one-action rounds, so a deep answer arrives
// once per round and the same thinking costs the run several times over. Its
// seat answers [Low] when nothing above the role spoke — and only then: a rung
// on the task, the conversation or the turn still wins, which is what keeps a
// deliberately deep task deep.

	// next one and never half-way through the one in flight.

// conversation rung is a person leaning on the dial in front of them right now,
// and a task rung is a decision made when the work was handed out, possibly days
// ago and possibly by the model. The nearer hand wins.
