//
// FAILSAFE.md clauses 3 and 4: a fail-safe that fires without saying so is a
// fail-safe nobody can autopsy, and a run that repaired itself twice looks
// exactly like a run that never had to. Every repair this seam performs is
// therefore announced to a journal the caller installs on the context — one line
// for a person watching, one row in the store for whoever reads it afterwards.
//
// It rides the context for the reason provider.WithCall does: only the door that
// opened the run knows where a record belongs, and only the pass making the call
// knows what happened. A call made without a journal is not an error and not a
// special case — every path that has no store is one — and Repaired is simply
// never reached.

// RepairKind is what the seam did.

	// "The answer was not readable" is two different facts and this seam was

	// all is a model reasoning out loud, and the re-ask is the mechanism
	// working. A reply that decoded and was refused by the caller's own
	// contract — a delivery verdict naming a file the record does not hold, or
	// quoting something the request never states — is a model answering a
	// question it was asked badly, and the re-ask may be buying nothing.

	// line, and it is the line nobody had.
