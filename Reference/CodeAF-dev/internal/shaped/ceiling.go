// ── HOW MUCH ROOM A SHAPED ANSWER GETS ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// NOTHING HERE IS SENT ANY MORE. Read that first, because everything below it
// was written when this figure was a max_tokens on the wire. It is not: the
// generation-defaults wave took every app-imposed ceiling off every request in
// this tree, structured calls included, and a shaped ask now goes out with its
// schema and no room (shaped.go's request).
//
// WHAT IS LEFT IS THE UNIT OF ACCOUNT. The repair loop has to terminate, and it
// terminates because spend grows toward the reserve; a provider that reports no
// usage would otherwise let it grow by nothing forever, so a cut reply is
// counted as having spent a reply's worth, and THIS is the figure that says what
// a reply's worth is. It is an estimate used for bookkeeping, never a request —
// which is why the derivation below still reads as a derivation and no longer
// reads as a promise to any model.
//
// Every ceiling this system ever sent a structured call was a literal: 8192 in
// the planner, a reserve-eighth in the delivery gate, eight thousand plus an
// echo in the intent compiler. Each was right about the call its author had in
// front of them and wrong about the next one — and the planner's was wrong in
// the direction that costs a whole run, because a fan-out asking for five parts
// was given the room for one verdict and cut off in the middle of the second
// part. The cap is not a property of the pass. It is a property of THE ASK.
//
// So it is derived, from three things and nothing else:
//
//	room = one object × how many objects were asked for  +  what must be echoed
//
// ONE OBJECT is a share of the completion reserve — the room the whole tree
// keeps for a reply and its reasoning, CODEAF_COMPLETION_RESERVE, which an
// operator may move and which everything else here moves with. A form-shaped
// answer genuinely is small beside a leaf's completion, so it takes a fraction
// rather than the whole; the floor under that fraction is what stops a lowered
// reserve from starving the deliberation a reasoning model does before it writes
// a word. The share and the floor are the delivery gate's own numbers, which
// were measured there and are now stated once for everybody.
//
// HOW MANY OBJECTS is the ask's own figure — the fan-out's permitted width, and
// one everywhere else. Where a prompt tells the model how many parts it may
// return, the same constant feeds both, so the sentence the model reads and the
// room it is given cannot drift apart. This is the term that was missing, and
// the only one that changes a number anybody had already measured: every
// single-object call in the system comes out of this function with exactly the
// ceiling it had before.
//
// WHAT MUST BE ECHOED is the intent compiler's discovery, generalised. Its brief
// carries the user's instruction back twice — inside the goal and under
// "Verbatim request:" — so a reply to a long ask cannot be short however small
// the schema is, and a ceiling that ignored it cut two GAIA questions in half
// for a third of a cent each. A pass whose answer quotes nothing pays nothing
// for this term.
//
// Then the memo has the last word. A model that has been WATCHED overrunning a
// lane's ceiling is never sent that ceiling again in this profile: the seam
// raises it to what the model actually spent, doubled, which is the same
// arithmetic every retry in this tree has always used. Evidence beats
// derivation, because the derivation is an argument and the memo is a
// measurement. Nothing here shrinks a ceiling: a model that answered inside its
// room teaches nothing, and forgetting a cut would buy the same failure twice.
//
// Everything is bounded above by the reserve itself, which is the one figure an
// operator states about how large a completion may be.
const (
	// objectShare is how much of a completion reserve one form-shaped answer
	// takes. Moved here from internal/revision, where it was measured: a
	// judgement genuinely is small, and a cap sized for the visible object alone
	// was spent entirely on deliberation by reasoning models, so the object gets
	// a fraction of the reserve rather than a count of its own fields.
	objectShare = 8

	// objectFloor keeps that fraction from landing back where it started when an
	// operator lowers the reserve. It is the floor under one object, never under
	// the whole answer.

	// verbatim.
