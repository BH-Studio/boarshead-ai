// Package shaped is the one place the harness asks a model for an answer of a
// stated shape and reads what comes back.
//
// ── WHY IT IS ONE PLACE ──
//
// Before it existed, every pass that wanted JSON out of a model built its own
// version of the same three-step sequence: send with some ceiling, decode, and
// decide what an unusable reply means. The planner had one, the delivery gate
// had another, the intent compiler had a third, and two of them scanned for
// braces by hand. They disagreed about everything that matters. The s4 sweep
// (bench/deepswe/AUTOPSY.md) cost two of five runs to that disagreement, on one
// model, in one afternoon:
//
//   - the planner's fan-out was cut at the completion ceiling, the object was
//     incomplete, and the run exited 1 with zero nodes and a third of a cent
//     spent — nothing attempted, on a task that had scored 17/20 the sweep
//     before;
//   - the delivery gate's verdict came back unreadable, which its own caller
//     treated as an abstention, so the work was "delivered as done, unjudged"
//     and the run exited 0.
//
// Neither is a failure of a model. Both are failures of a boundary that had no
// owner: a ceiling nobody derived from the ask, a truncation nobody continued,
// and a non-answer that meant something different at each door it arrived at.
//
// ── THE THREE THINGS THIS OWNS ──
//
// SIZING. The ceiling on a structured reply is derived from the ask — how many
// objects it asks for and how much of the material it must echo back — and then
// raised by what this model has actually been seen to need on this lane. See
// ceiling.go; the derivation is documented in PERF.md.
//
// REPAIR. A reply cut off mid-object is CONTINUED rather than re-bought: the
// expensive half of it is already in hand, and re-asking spends the same tokens
// to hit the same wall, which is precisely what the planner did before it gave
// up. A reply that never began an object is a different failure — prose, or a
// whole ceiling spent thinking — and there is nothing there to continue, so that
// one is asked again, once, with the format contract and its own offending words
// quoted back at it.
//
// THE VERDICT ON FAILURE. When the repairs are spent, this returns a TYPED
// fault. A caller may not read it as "the model declined to answer" or as
// "nothing to judge": the answer was not delivered, which is a fact about the
// run and has to reach the exit code. FAILSAFE.md's floor — a fail-safe cannot
// deliver nothing as done — is enforced by that type existing and by callers
// switching on it.
//
// What is NOT here: whether an answer that parsed is RIGHT. Only the call site
// can know that, and it reports it as it always did (provider.Report).
