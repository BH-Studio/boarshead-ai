// ── WHERE A BELIEF SLEEPS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The strike ledger this package replaces was in memory on purpose, and the
// reasoning was sound as far as it went: endpoint speed is a fact about the
// last few minutes, and a ledger that survived a restart would open every
// session acting on a claim it could no longer see.
//
// A FILTER MAKES THAT ARGUMENT UNNECESSARY. A belief that is written down is
// also written down with the moment it was true, and [Posterior.Predict] widens
// it on the way back in until, some hours later, it is worth about as much as
// the public sheet. So what survives a restart is not yesterday's verdict; it
// is yesterday's evidence, correctly discounted.
//
// THE AGEING HAPPENS AT READ TIME AND NOT HERE. This file loads what was
// written, with the moment each belief was true attached, and reads a clock for
// exactly one thing: stamping a compaction with the moment it happened, which
// is a fact about the FILE and about no belief in it. Whoever asks the ledger a
// question knows what time it is and ages the answer with [Posterior.Predict] —
// the same arithmetic a belief that has merely been sitting in memory for ten
// minutes needs, so there is one place that does it rather than one for each way
// a belief got old.
//
// ── STATE, AND THE OBSERVATIONS SINCE ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// This file is the COMPACTED half: the chains, the beliefs, the quality
// evidence, and the moment it was written. The other half is the append-only
// journal beside it (journal.go), which is where an observation goes the
// instant it is made and which is replayed over this file on every load.
//
// The split exists because the hierarchy has SHARED components. Two processes
// each hold μ, a[lane] and b[model] for the same subjects; "newer wins" would
// discard one of them outright, and a belief set cannot be merged component-
// wise without knowing which evidence went into it. Observations can: they
// replay. So beliefs are written whole, on a beat, and observations are written
// one line at a time, and a cold process reads both.

// ── TWO PROCESSES, ONE FILE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A PERSON RUNS codeaf TWICE. One window is talking to a remote host and the
// other is a plain session in another directory; both are this program, both
// hold a ledger of their own, and both write the whole set to the same file.
// Written as a bare replace, THE LAST ONE TO SAVE WINS OUTRIGHT — and it wins
// with a file that knows nothing about the other process's models.
//
// That is not a hypothetical. On 2026-08-30 a machine with two sessions open
// had a seventeen-lane sheet for `moonshotai/kimi-k3` fetched, decoded and
// primed at 10:31; at 10:34 the other session saved its own ledger — eighteen
// beliefs about a different model — and the kimi lanes were gone from the file.
// The next process loaded the survivor, found two lanes it had merely SEEN and
// no lanes it could choose between, and answered every request with no opinion
// at all. Nothing failed and nothing was logged: a whole mechanism was simply
// not there, and the only symptom was five seconds of somebody waiting.
//
// SO NOTHING IS EVER WRITTEN AS A BARE REPLACE. A write of the whole set is a
// READ-MERGE-WRITE UNDER A LOCK and the merge is by lane id: what one process
// has never heard of, it may not delete ([mergeBeliefs]). The lock is advisory
// and process-wide ([internal/filelock]), the read inside it is the file as it
// stands, and the write out of it is an atomic rename — so a reader that takes
// no lock at all still never sees a half-written set.
//
// AND WHAT CROSSES BETWEEN THE TWO PROCESSES IS OBSERVATIONS, NOT BELIEFS. A
// merge by lane id cannot reconcile the hierarchy, whose μ, a[lane] and b[model]
// are held by both processes with different evidence folded into each. So the
// two write one line per observation to the journal beside this file
// (journal.go) and both replay it, which is a merge that needs no rule: the
// same observations in the same order are the same belief.
//
// AND THE COMPACTION IS SOMEBODY ELSE'S GOROUTINE. An observation is one
// O_APPEND write on the send path, under a lock that is asked for and never
// waited on; the compaction that folds the journal into this file takes the
// exclusive lock and therefore runs only on the writer ([ledger.Persist]).
// Holding both that lock and the ledger's mutex is issue #264, and it cost a
// person twenty-nine silent minutes.

// ErrNoStore is what a store with nowhere to write answers with, so that
// "nothing was kept" and "nothing can be kept" are never confused for each
// other. A file that is simply not there yet is the first of those and reads
// back as no beliefs and no error.

// fresher is one lane's belief as two processes TOGETHER know it.
//
// THE HALVES ARE RECONCILED SEPARATELY, and that is the correction. A belief is
// not one observation with one moment: the timing filters move on a SIGHTING
// and carry [Belief.At], the quality filter moves on an OUTCOME and carries
// [Belief.QualityAt], and what the lane IS moves on a SHEET ROW and carries no
// moment at all. One process that measured a lane a minute ago and another that
// primed it from the sheet a minute ago each hold a different half, and keeping
// only the newer of the two WHOLES throws the other half away — which is how a
// lane with a fresh seventeen-row sheet behind it ends up in the file with
// every fact blank.
//
// So: the newer sighting wins the timing, the newer outcome wins the quality,
// and a fact that was published beats a fact that was never asked for. A tie on
// a moment keeps the account already held, which is arbitrary and deterministic
// — the two processes converge on the next save either way.
