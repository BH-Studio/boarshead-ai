// ── THE SAME FIVE CLAIMS, AGAINST THE REAL ROUTER ───────────────────────────
//
// `e2e_test.go` proves the mechanism against a fake router whose lanes behave
// exactly as they were scripted. That is the right instrument for a claim about
// arithmetic and the wrong one for a claim about the world: the fake router's
// sheet is a table somebody typed, its lanes never queue behind anybody else's
// prompts, and its idea of a heavy tail is a number in a struct.
//
// This file spends real money to check the four things a fake router cannot
// say anything about:
//
//  1. THE SHEET IS REAL AND IT IS RICH. `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` really is
//     served by more than a handful of machines, and the router really does
//     publish four percentiles for each of them. If either of those stops being
//     true, every prior in this design is invented.
//  2. THE PREFERENCE IS HONOURED. What the chooser asks for reaches the router
//     in a shape it acts on, and the lane that answers is one the sheet knows.
//  3. THE FIRST TOKEN IS MEASURABLE FROM OUT HERE. The whole belief rests on
//     timing the wait before the first token separately from the writing after
//     it, and that separation has to survive a real connection.
//  4. A SLOW LANE CAN BE RESCUED. Pinned on purpose to the slowest machine that
//     still passes the gate, a hundred and fifty tokens is a wait long enough to
//     be worth a second request — and the watch either takes it or says, on the
//     day, that it was not needed.
//
// ── WHAT IT COSTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every call here is capped at a small `max_tokens` and the whole run prints
// the exact `cost` the router billed, added up from the usage frames. On the
// model it is written against that total is a fraction of a cent. Nothing here
// retries and nothing here loops.
//
// ── HOW TO RUN IT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//	go test -tags e2e ./internal/lane/ -run TestReal -v
//
// It skips, green and loudly, with no key. The key is resolved exactly as a
// session resolves it (`internal/config`.APIKeyAt): the OpenRouter variable,
// then the OpenAI one, then the profile file — so a machine that can run codeaf
// can run this, and one that cannot is told which of the three to set.
//
// It is an EXTERNAL test package on purpose. It imports `internal/provider`,
// and the dependency between these two packages points that way: a file in
// package `lane` that imported the transport would be an import cycle the day
// the transport starts asking the registry for a preference.
