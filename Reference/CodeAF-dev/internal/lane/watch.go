// ── THE WATCH: ONE CONTROLLER, DRIVEN BY ONE STREAM ─────────────────────────
//
// Everything before this point picks a lane before the request goes out. The
// watch is the half that can still act after it has gone, and since
// `docs/design/waiting/DESIGN.md` it decides nothing itself: it is the ADAPTER
// between the shape a stream loop has — tokens, heartbeats, a beat asking
// whether anything has arrived — and [control.Controller], which holds the one
// inequality every phase of every call is judged by.
//
// WHAT THAT REPLACED, AND WHY EACH ONE WENT. This file used to hold four
// absolutes and each of them was a belief wearing an invariant's clothes:
//
//   - a fifteen-second gap that alarmed on its own, which said the same thing
//     about a lane writing six tokens a second and one writing two hundred;
//   - sixty-four tokens of commitment, which was right for a four-hundred token
//     reply and wrong for a four-thousand token one;
//   - an eight-second ceiling on a derived deadline, which existed only when a
//     belief did — so the one case that most needed a clock, a model nobody has
//     measured, was the one case that got none;
//   - one hedge per request, which is a counter where a purse belongs.
//
// They are all one line now: act when the expected remaining wait exceeds what
// acting would cost, and at the role's ceiling whatever the two say. The
// ceiling is the only absolute left, and it is the only one that is about a
// person rather than about a machine.
//
// The watch is still PURE: it holds no clock, no lock and no channel, and every
// method takes the moment as an argument. Whoever drives it — one stream loop
// and one beat, one call at a time — owns the serialization, and
// `internal/provider/hedge.go` is that owner.

// DeadPathFloor is the shortest silence that may be read as a DEAD PATH rather
// than as a slow lane.
//
// It is the one claim the controller cannot make, because it is not about time
// at all: a stream that has carried neither a token nor a heartbeat says
// nothing about how fast the endpoint behind it writes — nothing ever reached
// it, or nothing ever came back — and charging the lane for it would demote a
// machine on the evidence of somebody's wifi. Three seconds is the floor under
// it because a TLS handshake and a cold connection can honestly take longer
// than a fast lane's whole believed wait.

// yields a plan — with a ceiling, with a floor, and with whatever alternatives
// the frontier named. That is the whole of "a cold ledger may not switch the
// clock off".
//
// IT TAKES A [Pace] RATHER THAN A BELIEF, and the difference is where the
// belief came from. A test scripts one with [PaceOf]; the transport asks
// [PaceFor], which prefers the four-level chain — the world's pace plus the
// provider's offset plus the model's — over a flat belief about a pair nobody
// has measured. Both answer the same two questions, so the plan is built once

		// every arm of this question writes into it, so two of them can never

		// still in front of this call, priced at what one second of it is worth
		// to whoever is waiting ([spendable]). It is derived here, once, for the
		// reason the deadline is: a second place that named a figure would be a

//
// ── TWO FACTORS, AND THE SECOND ONE USED TO POINT THE WRONG WAY ─────────────
//
// HOW LONG is [Role.GiveUp]: the longest wait still in front of this call, which
// is the most a rescue could ever buy back.
//
// WHAT A SECOND OF IT IS WORTH is the other factor, and it is the one this got
// backwards until 2026-09-11. [AttentionValue] is stated in SECONDS PER DOLLAR —
// a dollar buys ninety seconds of somebody's attention back — so a second of a
// watched wait is worth `1 / AttentionValue` dollars, about a hundredth of a
// cent, and that is the rate at the TOP of the scale. [UnattendedValue] is a
// quarter of it because a second nobody is sitting through is worth a quarter of
// one somebody is ([Lambda]'s own account of why zero was measured wrong). So
// the discount for being unwatched is the RATIO `λ / AttentionValue`, and a
// second's worth is:
//
//	dollars per second = (λ / AttentionValue) / AttentionValue
//
// Dividing the wait by λ, which is what this did, used that ratio upside down:
// the smaller λ of an unwatched call made its seconds four times DEARER than a
// watched person's, so a conversation somebody was reading was allowed $1.00 to
// rescue itself and a background task node $12.00 — the one rail in front of a
// rescue, sized in the opposite order to who is waiting. It is the shape the
// deleted process-wide allowance had (refusing the request that needed it) with
// the priority order reversed rather than removed.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT ORDER. It orders the RATE: no second of a watched
// wait is ever worth less than a second of an unwatched one, which is the law
// beside this in watch_test.go. It does not order the total, and must not —
// a standing pass really does tolerate nine minutes where a conversation
// tolerates ninety seconds, and six times the wait at a quarter the rate is
// worth more than one times the wait at the full rate. What the wait is worth is
// the product; what nobody is allowed to say is that an unwatched SECOND is
// worth more.
//
// A ROLE NOBODY WAITS ON SPENDS NOTHING, and that is λ at zero rather than a
// case here — the controller already refuses to act for such a role below its
// ceiling ([hazard.reachable]), and saying it again would be the same rule
// written twice. Today no role answers zero ([Lambda]'s floor is
// [UnattendedValue]), so the guard is against a plan somebody builds by hand.
