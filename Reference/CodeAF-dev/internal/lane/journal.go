// ── WHY THE FILE GREW A SECOND HALF ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The belief file used to be the whole story: write the set, merge last-writer
// -wins per lane, done. THE HIERARCHY MAKES THAT ACTIVELY WRONG. Two processes
// each hold μ, a[lane] and b[model] for the SAME subjects and each has folded
// different evidence into them, so "newer wins" discards one process's
// afternoon because the other happened to save second — and the shared levels
// are exactly the ones that make a cold start work.
//
// Observations, unlike beliefs, MERGE BY BEING REPLAYED. So the store becomes
// two files:
//
//	lanes.json   the compacted state — the chains, the beliefs, the moment
//	lanes.log    one line of NDJSON per observation since that moment
//
// APPEND is one write under O_APPEND with a SHARED advisory lock, and it IS on
// the send path — an answer is folded in the moment it finishes. Shared,
// because two appenders do not conflict — O_APPEND is what keeps their bytes
// apart — and the lock is there only to keep them out of a compaction, which is
// why it is asked for once and never waited on.
//
// LOAD reads the state and replays the whole journal into it in time order.
// Observations commute in this filter to first order and exactly in time order,
// so two processes reading the same two files converge on the same belief.
//
// COMPACT takes the EXCLUSIVE lock, which no appender can be inside, replays,
// writes the state through a temporary file and a rename, and truncates the
// journal to zero. It happens ON THE WRITER GOROUTINE ALONE ([ledger.Persist])
// and never in front of somebody's first token — which is issue #264, and used
// to be untrue of the first observation of every process.
//
// A MISSING JOURNAL IS AN EMPTY ONE. A LINE THAT WILL NOT PARSE IS SKIPPED AND
// COUNTED — a half-written record from a machine that lost power is one
// observation lost, and refusing to read the file around it would be an
// afternoon lost.

// journalLimit is how many records may pile up before a compaction is worth
// doing. It bounds the replay a cold process pays for: five hundred records is
// a few milliseconds of arithmetic and about a hundred kilobytes.
const journalLimit = 512

// thought is one whole thinking phase, timed. It is keyed on the model and the
// effort rung it was asked at because that is what the duration is a property
// of; a lane can only make the same thought arrive faster.

// "nothing here waits on a lock"). The lock is only here to keep the write out
// of a compaction's truncation; without it the write still happens, which is
// what a lone process has always done and what a person on a network home is
// entitled to, and the worst it can cost is this one observation.
