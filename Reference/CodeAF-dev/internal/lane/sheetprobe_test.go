// ── A ROUTER IS KNOWN BY WHAT IT ANSWERS ────────────────────────────────────
//
// This build used to decide whether an endpoints page was ever fetched by
// testing the base URL for `openrouter.ai`, so a proxy, a mirror, a self-hosted
// router or the router reached by its IP silently got no sheet (issue #373).
// The law is that the base is ASKED, ONCE, and its answer remembered; the
// hostname survives only as a hint that skips the asking. Every test here is
// one clause of that law, driven through a fetcher that answers whatever the
// test says and counts how often it was made to.

// answering is a [Fetcher] whose reply the test scripts, and which counts its
// calls so that "was the base asked again" is a number and not a guess.
