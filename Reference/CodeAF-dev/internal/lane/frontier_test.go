// seventeen-row sheet for a model in memory and TWO beliefs about it on disk,
// both of them lanes that had merely been seen: an id, a moment, and every
// other field a zero nobody wrote. Read as published facts, those zeros said
// "refuses tool calls, will write no tokens, reads no prompt, is free" — and
// the first request carrying a tool definition found the candidate set empty.
//
// The law they hold is one sentence: A ZERO NOBODY WROTE IS UNKNOWN, AND
// UNKNOWN IS NEVER A REASON TO REFUSE.

// seenOnly is a belief as it arrives from a sighting alone: the id and the
// timing, and nothing about what the machine IS.
