// ── ONE BEAT PER SHEET, HOWEVER MANY DOORS ASK FOR ONE ──────────────────────
//
// Every door of this build now asks for a beat — the headless run as well as
// the session — and a process that opens two of them must still fetch each
// model's sheet once. Two fetch loops over one sheet would pay the router twice
// for the same half-hour aggregate and tick on two clocks the cache disagrees
// with, which is the drift [Beat] exists to prevent.

// TestASecondBeatJoinsTheFirstRatherThanFetchingAgain is that law, measured on
// the wire the only way it can be: by counting what the router was asked.

	// THE SECOND DOOR'S BEAT RETURNS AT ONCE. It hands its models to the beat

	// headless door ask for a beat without taking one away from a session.
