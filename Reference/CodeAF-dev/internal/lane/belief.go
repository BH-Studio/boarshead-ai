// ── THE LEDGER: WHAT THIS PROCESS HAS MEASURED ──────────────────────────────
//
// One [Belief] per lane per model — two scalar Kalman filters and a Beta — fed
// by four kinds of evidence and by nothing else: a sheet row, a finished
// stream, a probe, and an answer the caller could not use. The sheet primes it,
// the stream corrects it, the probe corrects it sharply, and the file under
// [StorePath] carries it to the next process.
//
// ── THE UNITS, STATED ONCE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// TTFT IS BELIEVED IN MILLISECONDS AND RATE IN TOKENS PER SECOND, in the log
// domain, which is what [Belief] and [Row] both already say and what the router
// publishes. Nothing here converts, so no seam has to remember that it should.
// The one place seconds appear is [PerceivedSeconds], whose caller divides by a
// thousand at the point it is used and nowhere else.
//
// ── THE LEDGER HAS NO CLOCK ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every moment it knows arrives on a [Sighting] or an [Outcome], and
// [Ledger.Belief] answers with the belief AS IT WAS STORED — not aged to now,
// because "now" is not something this type is entitled to an opinion about.
// The caller has [Request.Now] and ages what it reads with
// [Posterior.Predict], which is the same arithmetic whether the belief got old
// in memory or old in a file: one implementation, asked at the one moment that
// matters.
//
// [Belief.At] is therefore THE MOMENT OF THE LAST TIMED SIGHTING, and it is
// zero for a lane only the sheet has ever spoken about. A zero At is "there is
// nothing to age", never "aged since 1970", and a caller that ages a belief
// must ask.
//
// ── WHY A SIGHTING WITH NO MOMENT IS DROPPED ────────────────────────────────
//
// A sighting whose At is zero cannot be placed in time, and folding it in would
// stamp the belief with a moment that never happened — after which the next
// real sighting would age it by fifty-six years and the filter's variance would
// go to infinity. So it is refused, for the same reason an anonymous sighting
// is: an observation this ledger cannot attribute is one it must not keep.

// HalfLife is how long a belief takes to lose half its information when nothing
// new is heard about the lane. It is stated here because the ledger ages a
// belief on the way in and the chooser ages it on the way out, and a half-life
// that appeared in two places would be two different half-lives by Christmas.
const HalfLife = 10 * time.Minute

// QualityHalfLife is how long a belief about ANSWERS takes to lose half its
// information. It is six times [HalfLife] because the two things this package
// believes about a lane change on two different scales, and forgetting them at
// one rate gets one of them wrong.
//
// How quick a lane is right now is a fact about load: it moves minute to
// minute, and a reading from an hour ago is worth almost nothing. Whether a
// lane returns a usable answer at all is a fact about the deployment behind it
// — its quantisation, its context window, its truncation — and that holds for
// hours. Forgetting the second at the speed of the first makes the quality gate
// inert rather than lenient: a lane whose requests take five minutes each can
// never accumulate evidence faster than a ten-minute half-life burns it, so its
// mass sits at the prior's, the credible bound sits at one, and a lane that
// refuses one answer in six is never dropped. The simulator found exactly that
// — see "Part III" in the design, C1 — and the fix is not a wider gate but a
// memory long enough to hold the evidence the gate is asking for.
const QualityHalfLife = 6 * HalfLife

// SheetWeight is the k a caller passes to [Ledger.Prime]: the sheet's
// pseudo-observation is worth a quarter of one of our own sightings, because it
// is a half-hour aggregate over everybody's prompts from everywhere and ours is
// about our prompt from here. Both are evidence; neither is truth.
const SheetWeight = 4.0

// ratedFloor is the shortest answer worth rating. Below it the generation
// window is mostly the handshake and the first token's own arrival, so its
// tokens-per-second is a measurement of a warm-up rather than of a lane.
const ratedFloor = 32

// defaultSpread is the σ of a log-normal used when the sheet's own percentiles
// cannot give one — a p90 that is not above the p50, or no sheet at all. It is
// about a 1.6× spread between the median and the ninetieth percentile, which is
// narrower than a bad lane and wider than a good one, so a belief built on it
// is honestly uncertain rather than confidently wrong either way.
const defaultSpread = 0.6

// z90 is the standard normal's ninetieth percentile, which is how a p50 and a
// p90 become a location and a scale.
const z90 = 1.2816

// ledger is the live belief set.

// one machine's generation rate fell about ninefold at 09:33 and the belief
// admitted it for five more steps over thirty-three minutes, one of them a
// nine-minute answer, because each collapse arrived as one observation against a
// posterior far too certain to move. Adopting the observation outright is
// exactly what [Posterior.Update] already does for a belief that knows nothing,
// which is what a belief whose subject has just changed IS.

// IT DOES NOT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// the sighting series above (see the replay in belief_test.go), the CUSUM peaks
// at 3.40 against [cusumAlarm]'s 4.0 and then DECAYS, so the reset below never
// runs and the flat belief goes on crawling: by the fifth collapsed sighting the
// chain was at 7.4 tokens a second and the flat belief the chooser ranks on was
// still at 17.1.
//
// The cause is structural rather than a knob set wrong. The test rides on the
// residual of [chains.fold], and the chain absorbs about four fifths of a
// surprise in ONE observation — its gain is (ΣP)/(ΣP+R) over all four levels,
// and [levelSpread] squared and summed is 2.86 against an observation noise of
// [defaultSpread] squared, which is 0.36, so the gain is about nine tenths — so a
// genuine step leaves one large residual and then a run of small ones, which is
// the opposite of the persistent offset a CUSUM exists to accumulate. Lowering
// the alarm would trade this for false steps on ordinary noise, and giving the
// flat belief its own change point would be a third account of one number. The
// fix belongs where the two accounts are reconciled, and it moves how every lane
// is ranked, so it is a bench question and not a lane's.
//
// AND THE OBVIOUS ANSWER — PROCESS NOISE — HAS BEEN MEASURED AND IS NOT IT. The
// filter freezes because a run of consistent sightings shrinks P toward R/n with
// nothing to inflate it between them, so the textbook repair is a Q added on
// every step, or a floor under P. Replayed offline over ten days of the call log
// (3,605 requests, 1,157 of them with a person watching), a floored P moved
// watched regret by 0.9% — inside the estimator's own 24% median error, so not a
