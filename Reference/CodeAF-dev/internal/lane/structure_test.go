// has a reason to break one of these four rules in a hurry. Each is stated in
// the package doc and each fails here with a file name and a line number.
//
// They are structural tests in this repo's convention — the sources are read
// with go/ast and held to a law rather than to a behaviour, as
// `internal/session/taxonomy_law_test.go` does for the response boundary.

// sources parses every .go file in this directory, test files included, and
// says which are which.

// This package holds an opinion about lanes. It does not fetch, it does not
// stream, and it does not draw. The transport adapts it and the surface reads
// it, and both of those directions are one-way: an import of `net/http` here
// would mean a belief could go and look something up, which is the exact
// failure the "no fetch on the send path" law exists to prevent, and an import
// of a surface would mean a number could be formatted for a person in the place
// that computes it.
//
// The one legitimate need for a server in this package's tests is met by
// `internal/lane/lanestub`, which is a separate package for that reason.
