// ── THE THIRTY MINUTES NOBODY SENT ANYTHING (issue #264) ────────────────────
//
// On 2026-09-01 a chat process issued no model call at all for 29m49s. The
// network was fine. The belief file's own gate was held, [ledger.keep] reached
// [ledger.compact] on the first observation of the process, and the exclusive
// flock underneath it was taken while the ledger's mutex was held — so every
// encode after it, which reads that same mutex, waited on somebody else's
// filesystem.
//
// THESE ARE PROPERTY TESTS AND NOT SCENARIOS. The defect is not a case, it is a
// shape: any door of this ledger that reaches a lock while holding the mutex
// the chooser reads stops the whole process. So the bound is asserted on the
// DOORS — a sighting, a read — with the file's gate held by somebody else for
// the whole test.

// sendBound is how long a door of this ledger may take while another process
// holds the belief file's lock. The work under it is arithmetic over a few
// hundred map entries, so this is four orders of magnitude of headroom; what it
// really separates is FINITE from the thirty minutes that were measured.
const sendBound = 2 * time.Second

// heldGate takes the belief file's own gate exclusively and hands back the
// release, exactly as another codeaf in the middle of a compaction holds it.
//
// It is a second open file description of the same path, which is what makes it
// a real conflict rather than a re-entrant one: flock is a property of the
// description and not of the process (internal/filelock).
