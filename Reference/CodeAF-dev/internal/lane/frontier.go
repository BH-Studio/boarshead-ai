// ── THE FRONTIER IS THE CANDIDATE SET ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// With seventeen lanes on one model, most of them are beaten outright: some
// other lane starts sooner AND writes faster AND costs less AND is more often
// right. A lane like that can never be the answer to any request, whatever λ
// is, so it should never be sampled, never probed and never hedged to. Pruning
// them first is what makes the exploration budget land only where it could
// change a decision, and it usually leaves three to five.
//
// THE COMPARISON IS AT THE p75, NOT THE MEAN. A lane nobody has measured much
// has a wide posterior, and at the p75 that width keeps it in the set: it might
// be good. Pruning on the mean would quietly make this a router that only ever
// uses what it already knows.
//
// Two steps happen here and they are different kinds of judgement. THE GATE is
// deterministic and is about capability: a lane that cannot write the requested
// number of tokens, cannot read the prompt, serves four-bit weights, or returns
// answers this build could not use, is dropped outright — never sampled and
// found wanting. THE PRUNE is about dominance and nothing else: it removes lanes
// no request could want, and it removes them without knowing what this request
// wants.
//
// ── AND THREE OF THE SHEET'S CLAIMS ARE PRIORS RATHER THAN GATES ────────────
//
// THE MEASURED FAILURE (docs/design/recovery/DESIGN.md §1). On 2026-09-10 a
// tool-carrying request drew nine identical refusals from a saturated Fireworks
// while GMICloud — which had served the three previous tool calls of the very
// same task, in six seconds each — was not a candidate at all, because the
// fetched sheet marks it `Tools: false` and this file removed it from every tool
// request for good. The router's flag was simply wrong, and this build had
// already measured the same class of wrongness once (quirks.go's MiniMax memo).
//
// THE LAW: THE SHEET SEEDS A BELIEF AND NEVER ENDS AN ARGUMENT. `Tools`,
// `Uptime5m` and `Status` are the router's opinion about a machine, published
// minutes ago, about a fleet that moves; what this process has SEEN is evidence,
// and evidence outranks an opinion. So a lane the sheet doubts is DEMOTED — it
// sits behind every lane nothing is doubted about, it is never asked first while
// a better answer exists, and one request in [probeInEvery] is allowed to
// disprove the doubt ([sheetDoubtsLast]). A lane whose own answers have since
// proven it usable is not doubted at all, and that belief decays back toward the
// sheet's prior on [QualityHalfLife] like every other belief here, so nothing
// learned is learned forever.
//
// ONE HARD EXCLUSION SURVIVES and it is the wire's own negative: [Serves]. That
// is not the sheet's opinion, it is the router answering a request we actually
// made, and a machine the router will not send this model to is not a candidate
// at any rank.
//
// This file may not read a clock — see the note in choose.go. The beliefs it is
// handed have already been aged to [Request.Now] by the chooser.

const (
	// quartileZ is the standard normal deviate of the third quartile. Every
	// number this file compares is taken at it, on the pessimistic side of each
	// axis: the p75 of the first-token wait, and the p75 of the time per token,
	// which is the p25 of the RATE.
	quartileZ = 0.6744897501960817

	// UptimeFloor is the share of the last five minutes a lane must have been
	// answering to be worth choosing, in per cent. A lane below it is not slow,
	// it is intermittently absent, and the router's own fallback handles that
	// better than a preference for it would.
	UptimeFloor = 95.0

	// probeInEvery is how often a request may be sent to a lane the sheet doubts
	// ahead of the lanes it does not — the one draw that can disprove a published
	// claim, because a lane that is never asked can never prove the sheet wrong.
	//
	// IT IS AN EXPLORATION RATE AND IT NOW STANDS ON ITS OWN. It used to be
	// written as the hedge purse's own rate — two rescues in any twenty requests
	// — and that purse is deleted (hedge.go): what a call may spend rescuing
	// itself is its own budget now, and there is no per-window count anywhere to
	// borrow. What is left is the plain statement: one request in ten pays a
	// little to find out something every request after it spends better, which is
	// enough draws that a doubted lane is re-asked several times in an afternoon
	// and few enough that nine people in ten never meet one. It is a prior to be
	// fitted in the simulator, like the change-point's own two. The draw is the
	// chooser's own sampler, seeded per request and therefore reproducible.
	probeInEvery = 10

	// PriceCeilingMultiple is how far above the cheapest acceptable lane's own
	// output tariff another lane may charge, with nobody waiting.
	//
	// IT IS THE SAME 1.25 THE TRANSPORT ALREADY SENDS as `max_price`
	// (internal/provider's latencyPriceCeiling) and it is the same reasoning: a
	// lane 25% dearer is buying a latency edge somebody can feel, and a lane 4×
	// dearer is buying nothing a person notices. The difference is that this
	// ceiling is relative to the CHEAPEST LANE SERVING THIS MODEL rather than
	// to the model's published list price, because the list price is a figure
	// no endpoint is obliged to match.

// candidate set the first time a router stopped publishing a column.
//
// ── AND A LANE NOBODY HAS LOOKED UP IS UNKNOWN ON EVERY FIELD ───────────────
//
// There was one exception here and it was wrong. Tools was read as a flag whose
// absence states a fact — "this lane does not take tool calls" — which is true
// of a row the sheet published and false of a lane that has only ever been
// SEEN. A lane arrives that way whenever an answer comes back from a machine
// this process has no row for: the id is real, the timing is real, and every
// other field is a zero nobody wrote. Read as a published false, that zero
// removed the lane from every request carrying tools — which on a machine whose
// only kimi beliefs were two sightings meant the whole candidate set went, the
// choice came back empty, and the request went out with no opinion on it at all.
//
// THAT FIX WAS HALF OF ONE. It spared the lane nobody had looked up and left the
// lane the sheet had spoken about WRONGLY removed for good, which is the
// GMICloud case above. Both halves are now answered the same way and in the same
// place: neither zero nor published-false is a gate here, and [sheetDoubtsLast]
// ranks what is doubted behind what is not. A gate answers "could this lane

//
// AND EVIDENCE BEATS ALL THREE. A lane whose own answers have come back usable
// — the quality belief this process built from outcomes it saw, at the standard
// this request needs — is not doubted whatever the sheet says, because that is a
// measurement of the very thing the sheet is guessing at. It is the same belief

// ── WHAT A ROLE'S OWN COLUMNS SAY ABOUT CHOOSING A MACHINE ──────────────────
//
// THERE IS NO RULE IN THIS PACKAGE ABOUT ANY NAMED ROLE AND NO LIST OF MACHINES
// ANYWHERE IN IT. Every policy below is derived from two columns the role table
// already declares ([RoleFacts.Visible], [RoleFacts.Patience] through
// [Role.Ceiling]) and from what has been MEASURED of a lane. A role added to the
// table tomorrow gets the right behaviour with nobody editing this file, which
// is the whole reason the columns exist; a rule spelled `if role == …` would be
// a second table that disagrees with the first one within a month.
//
// THREE COLUMNS, THREE QUESTIONS, AND NO TWO OF THEM ARE THE SAME QUESTION:
//
//	is anybody         [RoleFacts.Interactive]. A call nobody waits on may be
//	waiting?           sent to the machine we think is worst, to find out; a
//	                   call in front of a keypress may not, because the whole
//	                   of it is dead time. It is also what says whether being
//	                   slower than the alternative is a REFUSAL or merely a
//	                   ranking — with nobody waiting, cheap and slow is right.
//	is it read?        [RoleFacts.Visible]. Somebody watches this stream
//	                   arrive, so the cost they really pay is the TAIL — the
//	                   request that took a minute, not the median that took
//	                   three seconds, and a median cannot tell the two apart.
//	how long is        [Role.Ceiling]. The moment we have already decided to
//	the patience?      act on a silence. A machine believed to still be silent
//	                   then is not a fallback, it is the fault.
//
// THE ONE READING IS [rolePatience.expected] AND EVERY POLICY IS DERIVED FROM IT. The
// order, the veto, the refusal list and the tie-break are four uses of one
// number, computed once per candidate, so that no two of them can come to
// disagree about which machine is the fast one. The two measured cases this was
// written from are both in it and neither is special-cased:
//
//	2026-09-11 09:33  the reflex tier's whole wait doubled on a machine nothing
//	                  had ever measured, because `provider.order` is a RANKING
//	                  the router may ignore once `allow_fallbacks` is true and
//	                  only `provider.ignore` takes a machine off the table
//	                  (#850) — so a veto has to reach `ignore`, not the order.
//	2026-09-11 10:02  a task step served at two tokens a second took 219
//	                  seconds while two machines on the same model were writing
//	                  at ninety, and the person read a `cd` row as stuck for
//	                  three and a half minutes. Its first token was healthy;
//	                  only the whole wait says anything about it, which is why
//	                  nothing here compares first tokens on their own.

// patience is what one request's role declares about waiting, read once and
// passed around rather than re-derived.
type rolePatience struct {
	// ceiling is [Role.Ceiling]: the moment something is done about a silence.
	ceiling time.Duration
	// waited is [RoleFacts.Interactive]: somebody is sitting in front of this.
	waited bool
	// read is [RoleFacts.Visible]: somebody watches this stream arrive.
	read bool

// patienceFor reads a request's role columns.
//
// A REQUEST THAT NAMED NO ROLE HAS NO DEADLINE, AND THEREFORE REFUSES NOTHING.
// [RoleUnknown]'s row is a sensible default for how a call BEHAVES — patient,
// unwatched, exploring a little — and it is a bad answer to "what is this call
// unwilling to wait for", because nobody said. Reading its thirty seconds as a
// declared deadline would strike machines off the wire's table on behalf of
// every call site in the tree that has not yet been taught to say what it is
// for, which is a real refusal made out of a default nobody wrote down.
//
// So the ceiling is zero for an unnamed role and [beyondThePatience] refuses
// nothing, while the two behavioural columns still read from [RoleUnknown]'s
// row — those are about how this call is treated, not about what it will
// refuse. It is the same reading internal/provider's workloadFor keeps at the

// compares two lanes, refuses one, or explains a choice is this number.
//
// ── THE DERIVATION, WHICH IS THE WHOLE OF IT ────────────────────────────────
//
// A lane's answer arrives in two parts and this process holds a posterior over
// each: how long until it says its first word, and how fast it writes after
// that. [PerceivedSeconds] already turns the pair into the seconds a person
// actually waits — first token, plus every hidden token at its full rate,
// plus the part of the visible text that arrives slower than anybody reads.
// Three things are then folded into that same number and nothing else is:
//
//	the role's risk      the pair is read at [rolePatience.riskZ] rather than
//	                     at the median, so the quantity is the wait this role
//	                     is actually exposed to and not the wait it averages
//	the lane's own       the quantile is taken over how far ONE ANSWER from
//	spread               this lane sits from its median ([Belief.Spread]),
//	                     measured, so a steady machine is widened by nothing
//	                     and a machine that alternates between a second and a
//	                     minute is widened by the minute
//	how often it         the caller divides by [Belief.Serving], because a lane
//	answers at all       that answers one request in five is asked five times
//	                     for one answer and the person sits through all five
//
// THE VETO IS NOT A SECOND RULE. A machine is refused exactly when this number
// is longer than the role's own declared patience ([beyondThePatience]) — "we
// are not waiting that long" — and the ranking is this number sorted. There is
// no ratio anywhere, no threshold anybody chose, and nothing that names a role
// or a machine: a role added to the table tomorrow, or a machine seen for the
// first time this minute, is handled by the same arithmetic.
//
// AND IT IS NEVER THE FIRST TOKEN ALONE, which is the half a reader is most
// likely to assume. A machine can say its first word promptly and then write at
// two tokens a second, which is a healthy first token and a four-minute answer;
// the generation term is what says so, and it is why a first-token comparison
// could not see the 2026-09-11 task step at all.
//

// beyondThePatience is the set of lanes this role will not ask at all: the ones
// whose [rolePatience.expected] time to a usable answer is longer than the role
// itself waits before acting on a silence — AND NEVER ALL OF THEM.
//
// IT IS ONE COMPARISON AND THERE IS DELIBERATELY NOTHING ELSE HERE. Every
// candidate's expectation was computed by one function from the same posteriors;
// the role's deadline is declared once in the role table; a machine is refused
// when the first exceeds the second. A reviewer who knows only that sentence can
// predict this package's answer for a pool it has never seen.
//
// A SET THAT IS ENTIRELY REFUSED IS A MODEL WITH NO GOOD MACHINE, and the honest
// answer there is the least bad one rather than no answer — [aboveServiceFloor]'s
// law, kept here for the same reason: an empty frontier is "no opinion", which
// sends the request out on the sort word to whichever of those same machines the
// router picks, blind. The refusal is therefore self-limiting in exactly the way
// a relative bound would have to be written to be: a machine stops being refused
// the moment it is the best there is.
//
// waits holds each candidate's expectation, in the order the candidates are
// given.
//
// A CANDIDATE WITH NO EXPECTATION IS NOT REFUSED, AND THE TEST FOR THAT IS THE
// FINITENESS OF THE NUMBER. [PerceivedSeconds] answers +∞ for a machine whose
// generation rate is not believed at all — "this lane never finishes", reported
// as such rather than as a large figure somebody might then compare — and a
// machine nothing has been measured of is exactly the shape that produces it: a
// lane that has only ever answered short, or only ever been probed, has a
// first-token belief and no rate belief, because [ledger.see] teaches the rate
// only past [ratedFloor]. Refusing THAT is refusing a machine for want of
// evidence rather than because of it, which is the very fault this whole change
// exists to end — the veto list built from what we know while the router picks
// from what exists. So it is ranked last on its infinity, as it always was, and
// stays in the set where a hedge, a walk or a rescue can still reach it. It is
// [ignoredOf]'s rule once more: we name the lanes we are SURE about, never the
// ones we have been unlucky with.

// when nothing else is left it is simply the answer. What it may not do is win a
// request outright on a score, while a machine nothing is doubted about is sitting
// there able to serve it.
//
// THE PROBE IS WHY THE DOUBT CAN EVER END. A lane that is always ranked last is
// a lane that is asked only when everything else has failed, which is the worst
// possible moment to find out it was fine all along — and on a healthy model it
// is never asked at all, so a wrong flag is wrong forever. One draw in
// [probeInEvery] promotes the best-scoring doubted lane to the front, its answer
// is folded into the belief through the same outcome path every other answer
// takes (internal/provider's noteLaneOutcome), and the doubt is then settled by
// evidence: a usable tool answer lifts it through [doubted], a refusal the
// decoder could not use — `tool_json` — pushes the belief back down and confirms
// the sheet was right.
//
// AND A PROBE NEVER RIDES A CALL SOMEBODY IS WAITING ON. Asking the machine we
// think is worst, first, is one request spent to settle a doubt every request
// after it profits from — a good bet on an errand and a bad one in front of a
// keypress, where the whole of the call is dead time and the same doubt could be
// settled by the next background pass for nothing. So the promotion is off for

//   - With nobody waiting (λ = 0) the ceiling is [PriceCeilingMultiple] times
//     the cheapest capable lane's own output tariff. A dearer lane is buying
//     speed that is worth nothing here, so it is not worth its money.
//   - With somebody waiting (λ > 0) the ceiling widens by what λ can justify:
//     the most a lane may cost above the cheapest is the seconds it could
//     possibly save, priced through λ — and no lane can save more than the
//     whole of the cheapest lane's perceived wait. That bound is deliberately
//     generous, because the score below already pays the difference honestly;
//     the ceiling is here to refuse the absurd, not to make the decision.
//
// THE SECOND HALF NEEDS AN ANSWER LENGTH TO DIVIDE BY, and it always has one:
// a request that states none is read at [AssumedAnswerTokens] before it reaches
// here ([chooser.Choose]). It used to be handed the zero instead, and a ceiling
// with no denominator was skipped whole — so a first turn, which is exactly the
// turn nobody has measured an answer for, was allowed any tariff at all (#686).
