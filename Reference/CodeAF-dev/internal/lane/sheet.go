// ── THE SHEET: A PRIOR NOBODY HAD TO PAY FOR ────────────────────────────────
//
// OpenRouter publishes, per model, one row per lane: first-token latency and
// throughput at the 50th, 75th, 90th and 99th percentiles over the last half
// hour, plus uptime, tariff, quantization, context and output ceilings, and
// whether the lane takes tool calls. That is a free prior for every lane of
// every model, which is why nothing in this design is blind on the first call
// of a process.
//
// ── THE TWO HALVES, AND WHY THEY ARE NOT ONE METHOD ─────────────────────────
//
// [Sheet.Rows] reads a map and returns. It never opens a connection, never
// touches a file after the first question about a model, and never blocks on
// anything but a read lock, because it is called from the encoder that runs
// immediately before a send. [Sheet.Refresh] goes to the network and belongs
// to [Beat] and to nothing else. A missing sheet is "no prior, use the belief
// alone"; it is never a reason to make somebody wait.
//
// ── WHY THE ROWS ARE DECODED ONE AT A TIME ──────────────────────────────────
//
// This is a third party's schema and it drifts. Decoded whole, one lane that
// grew a field of a shape this struct does not expect would fail the whole
// decode and the sheet would degrade from seventeen lanes to none — which the
// catalog reader in this repo learned the hard way and solved the same way
// (internal/catalog/catalog.go). A row that cannot be read is skipped and every
// row that can be read still arrives.
//
// ── WHY THERE IS NO net/http HERE ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A structural test in this directory fails the build when this package so much
// as imports a transport, and it is right to: a package that could open a
// connection is a package where somebody will eventually open one on the send
// path. So the one thing this file cannot own is injected as [Fetcher], and the
// transport package hands it in at session open through [WireSheet].

// ErrNoSheet is what a refresh returns while no sheet client is wired in. It is
// an error rather than a silent success because a beat that thinks it fetched
// is a beat nobody will ever notice is dead.
var ErrNoSheet = errors.New("lane: no sheet client")

// ErrNoSheetHere is what a [Fetcher] returns when the base ANSWERED, and its
// answer was that no endpoints ROUTE lives at that address at all.
//
// IT IS THE ONE ANSWER THAT MAKES A BASE SHEETLESS. A timeout, a severed
// connection, a 500 and a 429 are all a router having an afternoon, and a build
// that read any of those as "this is not a router" would throw away every lane
// behaviour it has for five minutes over one bad packet.
//
// AND A 404 IS NOT THIS ANSWER BY ITS STATUS; IT IS BY ITS BODY. The live router
// answers 404 twice over, and the two mean opposite things about the base
// (measured 2026-09-02):
//
//	GET /api/v1/models/nonexistent/model-xyz/endpoints
//	→ 404, {"error":{"message":"Not Found","code":404}}
//
//	GET /api/v1/nonexistent-route/x/endpoints
//	→ 404, <!DOCTYPE html>…<title>Not Found | OpenRouter</title>…
//
// The first is the router's own error envelope — the route is there and it
// answered about ONE MODEL, which simply has no page this round; it is a quiet
// per-model error and says nothing about the base. Only the second, a 404 whose
// body is not that envelope, is "no such route", and only that one wraps this
// error. Which bodies mean which is the transport's decision because only the
// transport can see a status and a body (internal/provider's sheetFetcher, and
// its sheetNotFound); everything here only asks whether the error it was handed
// wraps this one.
var ErrNoSheetHere = errors.New("lane: the base publishes no endpoints page")

// Fetcher is the connection this package may not open for itself.
//
// It is spelled in terms of a URL and a bearer key rather than in terms of a
// request and a response, because naming those types here would mean importing
// the transport this package is forbidden to know about. The implementation
// lives beside the router client, applies the same timeout the catalog reader
// uses, and turns a status that is not a success into an error — everything
// below this line only ever sees bytes or a reason there are none.
type Fetcher interface {
	Fetch(ctx context.Context, url, bearer string) (io.ReadCloser, error)
}

// maxSheetBytes is the ceiling on one sheet. Seventeen lanes of a large model
// come to about forty kilobytes, so a megabyte is two orders of magnitude of
// headroom and still a bound: an unbounded read of a third party's body is how
// one bad response becomes this process's memory problem.
const maxSheetBytes = 1 << 20

// sheetTTL is how old a cached sheet may be before [Beat] fetches at open. It
// is the same five minutes the beat runs on, so a session that opens a minute
// after the last one closed starts from that session's reading rather than
// paying for the same aggregate twice.
const sheetTTL = 5 * time.Minute

// ── HOW THIS BUILD LEARNS THAT A BASE HAS LANES ─────────────────────────────
//
// A ROUTER IS RECOGNISABLE BY WHAT IT ANSWERS AND NEVER BY A SUBSTRING OF WHERE
// IT LIVES. This build used to decide whether to fetch an endpoints page at all
// by testing the base URL for `openrouter.ai`, so a binary driven through
// CODEAF_BASE_URL at a proxy, a mirror, a self-hosted router or a router
// reached by its IP silently got no sheet, an empty frontier and no lane
// behaviour whatever — nothing errored, nothing logged a refusal, the feature
// was simply absent (issue #373).
//
// So the question is put to the base instead, ONCE, and the answer is
// remembered here beside the rows it is about.
//
// THE PROBE IS NOT A SECOND REQUEST. It is the reading of the endpoints fetch
// [Refresh] already makes, which is why a base that does serve a sheet pays
// nothing at all for the law: the first refresh both fetches and answers the
// question. A base that says there is no such page is not asked again until its
// answer goes stale, and staleness is [sheetTTL] — the same five minutes the
// beat runs on and the same five minutes a cached sheet is good for, because a
// second number here is a number that would drift.
type sheetAnswer int

	// answerUnasked is a base nobody has put the question to yet, which is the
	// state every wiring starts in except the one that carries a hint.
	answerUnasked sheetAnswer = iota
	// answerServes is a base that has handed back an endpoints page. It is
	// STICKY for the life of the wiring: a router asked about a model it does
	// not happen to serve answers 404 about THAT MODEL, and reading that as
	// "this is not a router" would cost every other model its lanes.
	answerServes
	// answerSheetless is a base that answered, and said there is no endpoints
	// page here. It suppresses fetching until [sheetTTL] has passed, and then
	// the question is asked again exactly once more.

)

// ── AND WHETHER IT CARRIES A ROUTING PREFERENCE ─────────────────────────────
//
// The same law one layer up, and it is the same law for the same reason. This
// build used to decide whether a `provider` object went on the wire at all by
// testing the base URL for `openrouter.ai` or the model id for the prefix
// `openrouter/` (internal/provider's isOpenRouter). So on a proxy, a mirror, a
// self-hosted router or the router reached by its IP, a person could rank
// lanes, pin one, and watch the settings row go on reading `pinned: X` while
// the preference was never sent: a silent substitution, which is the thing this
// repository's law forbids (issue #433).
//
// WHETHER A BASE HONOURS A PREFERENCE IS LEARNED FROM THE BASE, NEVER FROM ITS
// HOSTNAME. Two things teach it, and both are readings of a request that was
// going out anyway:
//
//   - A BASE THAT SERVED AN ENDPOINTS PAGE CARRIES THEM. That is the router's
//     own contract — a machine that publishes which lanes serve a model is a
//     machine that takes an instruction about which one to use — so [answerServes]
//     answers this question too and the shipped router pays nothing for the law.
//   - EVERY OTHER BASE IS ASKED ONCE, by a real request carrying a real
//     preference, and answers with what comes back: an answer that NAMES the
//     lane that served it carries them; a refusal that names the `provider`
//     field does not; and a 200 that carries no lane information at all is
//     read as "does not", which is the safe reading under the law — the person
//     is told, and the request still goes out.
//
// ONLY AN ANSWER TO A REQUEST THAT REALLY CARRIED ONE TEACHES ANYTHING. The
// widened retry that follows a refusal carries no preference, and it is
// answered — often perfectly, naming its lane — by the very base that had just
// refused the field. Read as evidence it would put the base straight back to
// [prefCarries] and the next turn would pay the identical refusal.
//
// WHAT THAT SILENT CASE CANNOT TELL APART, said plainly because a reader will
// otherwise assume it can: a base that honoured the preference silently and a
// base that dropped it on the floor look identical from here. Nothing in an
// OpenAI-compatible answer says which lane served it, so there is no evidence
// to separate them, and this build takes the reading that produces a sentence
// rather than the one that produces a silence.
//
// THE FIRST DEFINITE ANSWER STANDS, and only one of the three is indefinite. A
// base that served a sheet or named its lane has SHOWN it takes an instruction;
// a base that refused the field has SAID it does not; and either of those is the
// end of the question, because a build where the beat's next sheet could talk a
// refusal round would re-pay that refusal every five minutes for as long as the
// window lived, and a build where one refusal could overrule the shipped
// router's own contract would retire the feature on the machine it works on.
// Silence is the indefinite one: it proved nothing, so either definite answer
// arriving later replaces it. What clears any of them is the base MOVING, which
// is [wire]'s law and is the only one there is.

// A sheet says which machines the router PUBLISHES for a model. It does not say
// which machines the router will actually SERVE it from, and on 2026-09-01
// those were two different sets: three of the five tool-capable lanes on the
// sheet were not in the serving set the completion resolved against, so every
// request that pinned one of them came back
// `…but your request's provider.only preference permits only: coreweave`, six
// times in one run, and the lane was chosen again three separate times because
// nothing anywhere wrote the refusal down (issue #266).
//
// THE FIX IS NOT A BETTER SHEET. A sheet is fetched every few minutes and a
// wire refusal is a fact about this second; the honest shape is a positive half
// that is fetched and a NEGATIVE half that is learned, with the gate reading
// both. [RefuseServing] is the write and [Serves] the read, and [capable] in
// frontier.go is the one reader that matters: a lane the wire has refused
// leaves the candidate set, so the next pin cannot be chosen from it.
//
// IT IS FILED UNDER THE LEDGER KEY and never under the spelling that happened
// to be on the wire ([LedgerModel]). The whole defect had the bare id and the
// dated slug disagreeing about who serves a model; a refusal written under one
// of them and read under the other would reproduce that disagreement inside
