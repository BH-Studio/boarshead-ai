// ── THE CONTROLLER ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One inequality, three distributions, six acts. Everything below is the
// arithmetic of `docs/design/waiting/DESIGN.md` §B and nothing else: no clock,
// no connection, no vocabulary a person reads.
//
// At every moment the controller holds two numbers.
//
//	W(s)  what going on waiting is expected to cost, in seconds
//	A     what acting is expected to cost, in the same seconds
//
// It acts when W(s) > A + m, and at [Plan.Ceiling] whatever the two say,
// because a belief that recommends waiting past a person's patience is
// answering a question nobody asked. THE CEILING IS THE ONE ABSOLUTE: a plan
// with no belief at all still reaches it, which is the whole of "from zero
// history, every call is bounded".
//
// WHAT THE CEILING BOUNDS IS REAL SILENCE — a wire that has stopped writing —
// and not the gap between two readable words. The argument is at
// [hazard.stillSince]; the short version is that a model writing six thousand
// tokens of reasoning is the opposite of a model that has stopped, and a bound
// that could not tell the two apart called the fastest stream of the day a
// stall at ten seconds.
//
// The three phases differ only in which distribution stands behind W:
//
//   - SILENT, nothing has arrived: the serving lane's first token, measured
//     from the moment the request went out.
//   - THINKING, reasoning deltas and nothing on the screen: TWO clocks, because
//     a legitimately long think and a stalled think look identical for the
//     first few seconds and must not be answered the same way. The liveness
//     clock asks whether the endpoint is still writing at all, against the gap
//     between two deltas. The duration clock asks whether this thought is
//     pathologically long, against how long this model's whole thinking phase
//     lasts — AND IT PRICES THE ALTERNATIVE'S OWN THOUGHT INTO A, because the
//     second request would have to think the same thing. That one term is what
//     stops a minute of deliberation being answered with a second minute of it.
//   - WRITING, visible text arriving: the gap between two visible tokens.
//
// Heartbeats move nothing. `: OPENROUTER PROCESSING` is proof about the path
// and about nothing else, and a silence clock a router could hold open by
// saying nothing in a well-formed way is not a clock.

// ── TWO QUESTIONS, NOT ONE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The inequality above answers "DOES ACTING PAY". It does not answer "IS THIS
// LANE MISBEHAVING", and for a while this package used it for both — which is a
// defect and was measured as one. `bench/lanelab/REPORT.md` has the run: with a
// warmed store, where the belief about each lane is TIGHT and correct, the
// controller hedged healthy requests MORE often than it did from a cold one,
// because a cheap alternative and a well-known median make "another arm would
// probably be quicker" true on perfectly ordinary draws. Every one of those
// arms was a rational answer to the payoff question and a wrong answer to the
// question a person is actually asking, which is whether anything is wrong.
//
// So an act before the ceiling now requires BOTH:
//
//	(1) PAYOFF     W(s) > A + m, exactly as before, and
//	(2) ABNORMALITY  s is in the tail of the very distribution that clock reads.
//
// ── WHERE THE TAIL MASS COMES FROM, AND WHY IT IS NOT A KNOB ────────────────
//
// This is a Neyman–Pearson test and it is sized the way one is sized: fix the
// false-positive rate you are willing to pay, and let that fix the threshold.
//
// Under the null — the lane is fine — the silence on any one alarm opportunity
// is a draw from that clock's own survival, so the chance of it exceeding that
// clock's own (1 − p) quantile is exactly p. A request offers k such
// opportunities. By the union bound the chance that ANY of them raises a false
// act is at most k · p, so
//
//	k · p  ≤  the per-request false-act budget
//	p      =  [falseActBudget] / k
//	z      =  Φ⁻¹(1 − p)                       ([deviate])
//
// and the threshold is [Survival.Quantile](z) of whichever survival is
// governing. The union bound is CONSERVATIVE — the true rate is at most k·p —
// so the gate is at least as strict as the budget asks, never looser.
//
// **The budget is not a new number.** It is §K's own acceptance criterion:
// no more than 2% of healthy requests may carry an arm
// (`docs/design/waiting/DESIGN.md` §K, and Dean & Barroso's measured figure for
// how much extra traffic removes most of a p99). The test is sized to the bound
// it has to meet, which is the whole of the derivation.
//
// **k IS COUNTED FROM THE REQUEST'S OWN SHAPE, NEVER CHOSEN.** A request has
// exactly one first token, and its run of thought is asked about once, as a
// whole; the drift clock is asked once per gap between two visible tokens, and
// how many of those there are is [Plan.Expected], which the transport already
// says before the stream starts. So
//
//	k = 1 (first token) + 1 (the thought) + Expected (the gaps)
//
// and where nobody said how long the answer would be, k is the two
// opportunities the request CERTAINLY has. Counting the unknown ones at a
// guess would be inventing evidence; counting them at zero is the honest floor,
// and the ceiling still bounds everything the looser gate lets through.
//
// ── WHAT THE GATE CANNOT DO ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// IT CANNOT MOVE TIME-TO-ACTION. The ceiling is untouched and is still absolute:
// at [Plan.Ceiling] the controller acts whatever both tests say, and what it
// does there — hedge, ask, report — is unchanged. And a genuinely stalled lane
// crosses any quantile of its own distribution within seconds by construction:
// that is what a stall IS. The gate refuses acts on TYPICAL draws and on
// nothing else.
//
// IT CANNOT REFUSE ON A NUMBER NOBODY MEASURED. An unknown survival has no
// quantile — [Survival.Quantile] answers zero — so the gate is open, and the
// payoff test cannot fire either because [Survival.Remaining] on that belief is
// nothing at all. A plan with no belief is bounded by its ceiling and by
// nothing else, which is exactly what it was before: WHERE NOTHING IS MEASURED
// THE ANSWER IS "KEEP WAITING WHILE THE WIRE IS ALIVE", never an invented
// number.

// ── A TOKEN IS PROGRESS ONLY WHILE THE STREAM IS KEEPING UP ────────────────
//
// The per-gap tail test above cannot recognize a uniformly slow stream. A run
// of gaps that are each ordinary enough on their own can together say that the
// visible rate has collapsed, and raising the one-gap threshold enough to hear
// that run would also condemn healthy jitter. So each VISIBLE-to-visible gap g
// contributes its standard-normal deviate under the lane's gap belief:
//
//	zi = (ln g - Gap.Mu) / Gap.Sigma
//
// After n gaps, sum(zi) / sqrt(n) is standard normal under that belief and can
// be compared with the SAME derived z above. At one gap it is exactly the test
// already made by [hazard.abnormal], so this adds no second threshold.
//
// The sum and its weight both decay by exp(-g / Ceiling) before the new gap is
// added. THE COLLAPSE MUST BE CURRENT: evidence from a bad patch is forgotten
// on the same horizon as the bound it can stop resetting, and repeated looks
// do not accumulate forever. This pair gates only whether a visible token is
// credited as progress; it raises no act and enters no payoff arithmetic. Once
// the aggregate says the stream is not keeping up, the existing absolute
// ceiling gets the same honest silence it gets from a stream that stopped.
//
// This clock deliberately reads the PAGE while the drift clock in [hazard.assess]
// reads the WIRE. [Plan.Gap] is the measured interval between visible tokens,
// and a model that interleaves long thoughts between single words really is
// delivering visible text too slowly for the person waiting. Past a ceiling of
// that rate it is rescued; the think-duration clock has already had its say.

// falseActBudget is the share of HEALTHY requests that may carry an act raised
// by the arithmetic rather than by the ceiling.
//
// IT IS §K's OWN ACCEPTANCE CRITERION AND NOT A SECOND NUMBER: "false hedges on
// a healthy lane ≤ 2% of requests". The abnormality gate is sized to the bound
// it has to meet — see the derivation above — so the two cannot drift apart,
// and moving this figure means moving the design's acceptance.
const falseActBudget = 0.02

// fallbackCeiling bounds a plan that arrived with none.
//
// A plan with no ceiling is a defect — every role has one ([internal/lane].
// Role.Ceiling) — and the conservative reading of a defect is the figure a
// person watching an empty line is asked to wait, not forever. It is spelled

// ── THE PACE A STREAM IS HELD TO IS NOT THE PACE OF WHOEVER ANSWERED ───────

// A MACHINE MAY NOT SET ITS OWN BAR, and until 2026-09-11 it did. The aggregate

// [Controller.Serving] re-points to the SERVING lane's own belief the moment the
// stream says who is really answering — so a machine that has been collapsing all
// afternoon is judged against the collapse. That is a closed circle: the more
// this process learned about a slow machine, the less any stream it served could
// ever read as slow. Measured that day, twice. One endpoint's believed rate had
// already fallen to about six tokens a second; it then wrote 604 tokens in 86
// seconds and 5,793 in 363, and both were "keeping up".
//
// THE BAR IS THE PACE THE QUESTION WAS SENT EXPECTING: the gap belief the plan
// was BUILT with, which is the machine the choice named and the reason this
// request went out at all. `provider.order` is advisory once fallbacks are on
// (#850), so the machine that answers is routinely not the machine that was
// asked for — and a router that substitutes a machine ten times slower has
// handed the person something they were never offered. That is what this notices
// and it is the whole of what it notices.
//
// IT IS NOT A RULE ABOUT SLOWNESS. Where the machine that answered IS the machine
// that was asked for, the bar and the belief are the same number and nothing at
// all changes — which is every ordinary request. A healthy stream on a machine a
