// Package control decides WHEN a wait has gone on long enough to act on, and
// it is the only thing in this build that decides that.
//
// ── ONE QUESTION, ASKED THE SAME WAY IN EVERY PHASE ─────────────────────────
//
// A request is silent for one of three reasons and until this package they were
// three separate rule sets: nothing has arrived at all, the endpoint is writing
// a run of thought nobody can read, or visible text was arriving and stopped.
// Three rule sets is three places to be wrong, and the measured defect was
// exactly that — a stall inside a run of thought was governed by none of them
// and waited two and a half minutes for a transport bound to notice.
//
// They are ONE question. Given a distribution over how long the next piece of
// VISIBLE PROGRESS takes, and given that we have already waited s without it,
// the expected remaining wait is
//
//	W(s) = E[T − s | T > s]
//
// and for a heavy-tailed T — which is what every measured lane is — W RISES
// with s. Somewhere it crosses what acting would cost: another arm's own wait,
// plus rewriting the visible text this one has already delivered, plus the
// money, converted through λ. That crossing is the moment to act, in every
// phase; only the distribution changes.
//
// ── WHAT THIS PACKAGE MAY NOT DO ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It holds no clock, opens no connection, reads no file and formats nothing for
// a person. Every method takes the moment as an argument, exactly as
// [internal/lane]'s chooser and watch already do, so a scenario written in
// minutes is tested in microseconds against a scripted belief. It imports
// nothing but the standard library — not even its parent — which is what keeps
// the arithmetic testable in isolation and the parent free to change.
//
// ── ROUTING AND WAITING ARE TWO QUESTIONS ───────────────────────────────────
//
// [internal/lane.Choice] answers WHICH LANE. This package answers WHEN TO ACT.
// They were one value once — a Choice with no alternative carried no deadline,
// so a cold ledger produced no routing opinion AND no clock, and a request with
// nothing to hedge to also had nothing watching it. A [Plan] is built for every
// token-generating call whether or not a Choice was made, and a plan with no
// alternatives still has a ceiling: the answer is then [Report] rather than
// silence.
