// ── ONE BUDGET, ONE ORDER, ONE OWNER ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE MEASURED FAILURE (docs/design/recovery/DESIGN.md §2 problem 1). Eleven
// controllers on one request path each owned a budget none of the others could
// see: three transport faults, six or sixty paced sends, four arms, one ladder
// arm, seven relaxation rungs, two models, and four different wall clocks over
// the top of them. Their product — 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 9 — is nobody's number, and
// the call census of 2026-09-10 measured what it produced: chains of sixteen
// and seventeen identical sends to one machine, running eleven minutes, ending
// refused.
//
// THE LAW: A CALL HAS ONE DEADLINE AND ONE LIST OF MOVES. [Plan.Deadline] is
// the whole of how long, in the person's own time (`lane.Role`'s patience);
// [Plan.Moves] is the whole of what has already been tried, shared by every arm
// of the same question so two arms can never demand one machine; and [Next] is
// the whole of what comes next. Nothing below the plan owns a retry count.
//
// THIS FILE HOLDS NO CLOCK, exactly as the rest of the package does not: every
// question takes the moment as an argument. That is what lets a scenario
// written in minutes be tested in microseconds.

// Move is one thing a failed call may do next: a different machine, the same
// machine after the wait it asked for, or the same machines with one field of
// the request taken off. It is the (machine, shape, model) triple the design
// names, plus the one legal wait.
//
// IT NAMES THE MACHINE WE EXPECT AND NEVER THE MACHINE WE COMMAND. `Lane` is
// read for what the person is told (`trying another machine · 2 of 5`) and for
// the claim that stops two arms of one race demanding the same endpoint; what
// actually reaches the wire is the REFUSING machines excluded, because
// `provider.order` is advisory once `allow_fallbacks` is true and R1 measured
// the router fanning past it (#850).

	// there is exactly one model hop in this build and it belongs to the
	// session (docs/design/recovery/DESIGN.md §4) — so every move of one plan
	// carries the same name, and it is here so a row can say which.

	// purpose: what a rung takes off is the transport's business
	// (internal/provider's relaxSet), and this package compares shapes for
	// equality and orders them, nothing more.
	Shape uint8
	// Wait is the comeback the machine itself named, and it is non-zero on
	// exactly one kind of move ([MoveWait]). A move to a DIFFERENT machine
	// costs no wait at all: a backoff is what is paid to ask the same machine
	// again, and it is the only thing it is for (retry.go's `moved`).
