package lane

// ── THE ACCEPTANCE TEST FOR THE WHOLE MECHANISM ─────────────────────────────
//
// Everything else in this directory tests one seam. This file tests the CLAIM:
// that a build which believes something about the machines behind a model
// starts faster than one that does not, moves off a lane that has gone bad,
// lets it back when it recovers, refuses one that returns answers nobody can
// use, and never goes to the network to decide any of it.
//
// Those are the five sentences the design is sold on
// (`docs/design/routing/provider-routing.md`, "Proof plan"), and they are written here as
// five scenarios rather than as unit tests because every one of them is a
// statement about the seams TOGETHER: a chooser that picks well over a ledger
// that forgets is worth nothing, and so is a ledger that learns for a chooser
// with no opinion.
//
// ── HOW IT IS WIRED, AND WHY IT IS NOT WIRED THROUGH THE TRANSPORT ──────────
//
// The scenarios drive `internal/lane/lanestub` — the fake router — through
// [e2eRouter], which is this file's own forty lines of transport: it asks the
// registry's chooser for a preference, puts it on the wire exactly as the
// router reads it (`provider.order`, `only`, `ignore`), watches the stream that
// comes back, spends at most one hedge on it under a budget, and folds the
// result into the ledger as a sighting. That is the whole of the contract in
// docs/ARCHITECTURE.md Decision 10, and it is written here rather than imported
// from `internal/provider` for one reason: this package may not know that
// package exists (a structural test in this directory says so, and the
// dependency really does point the other way). The transport's own half of the
// same contract is tested in `internal/provider`.
//
// ── THE TWO CLOCKS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A scenario written in the units of the world — a lane whose first token comes
// in 430 ms, an answer four hundred tokens long — takes half a minute of
// somebody's afternoon to run. So THE WIRE RUNS [e2eSpeedup] TIMES FASTER THAN
// THE WORLD IT DESCRIBES, and nothing else does: every duration that crosses
// into the ledger, every moment a request carries, and every figure asserted on
// below is in the world's own units, and only the timers armed against the
// socket are divided. The fast clock in `lanestub` is not used here, because
// two of these scenarios put two streams in flight at once and that clock is
// one timeline (see the note at the top of `lanestub.go`).
//
// ── WHY MOST OF THIS SKIPS TODAY ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This file was written in the same wave as the seams it tests, against the
// contract rather than against an implementation. While the empty chooser has
// no opinion, every scenario that needs one skips with the lane that owes it
// named in the message — [e2eSkipWithoutAChooser]. Nothing here is written
// loosely enough to pass on the empty implementations: a scenario that would
// pass against a chooser that answers nothing is a scenario that is not
// measuring anything.

// the worst at the tail, the one with the tight tail at four times the price,
// the fast one that cannot take a tool call, the cheap one that writes at six
// tokens a second, and two ordinary ones in the middle.
//
// Prices are DOLLARS PER TOKEN, which is the unit the router publishes and the
// unit this package stays in; the table quotes dollars per million output
// tokens, so 0.28 there is 2.8e-7 here. The table publishes no input tariff, so

// heads the order on roughly one request in fifty — so asserting that a
// sampler picked it in thirty requests is a test of a random number generator,
// and asserting that one snapshot of Order (at most three names, Thompson-
// sampled) contains it is the same coin toss wearing different clothes. The
