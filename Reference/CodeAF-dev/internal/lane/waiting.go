// ── WHAT IS BELIEVED, AND WHERE IT IS BORROWED FROM ─────────────────────────
//
// A belief per (model, lane) is blind on the first request to every pair, and
// the first request to a pair is the STEADY STATE: a person picks a model at
// runtime, the sheet is half an hour old at best, and the ledger has never
// heard of the seventeen machines behind it. The measured consequence was a
// three-minute wait with nothing watching it.
//
// So a belief is not one number with one history; it is a SUM OF FOUR, and each
// of them is learned from a different amount of evidence:
//
//	ln T(model, lane)  =  μ  +  a[lane]  +  b[model]  +  e[model, lane]
//
//	μ                the world's own pace, moved by everything
//	a[lane]          this PROVIDER, across every model it serves — a machine
//	                 that is quick for one model is usually quick for another,
//	                 and that is the fact a per-pair ledger threw away
//	b[model]         this MODEL, across every provider — a large model is slow
//	                 everywhere and a small one is quick everywhere
//	e[model, lane]   what is left: this deployment, on this pair, right now
//
// A prediction is the sum of the four means and the sum of the four variances,
// so a pair nobody has measured predicts from μ + a + b with an honestly wide
// spread rather than from nothing at all. That is the whole of cold start, and
// it needs no special case anywhere: [Chain.Known] is true the moment the world
// has a pace.
//
// EACH COMPONENT FORGETS AT ITS OWN RATE, because they are facts about
// different things. One deployment's queue turns over in minutes; a provider's
// fleet in half an hour; a model's size never. See the design for the figures
// and for which of them are priors to be learned.
//
// The equations, the priors, the borrowing rule, the change-point test and the
// file format are all in `docs/design/waiting/DESIGN.md`. This file is the
// contract they are written against.

// Level names one term of the sum above, and the order is the order of the
// terms: broadest first, narrowest last.

// Survival is this chain as the distribution the controller waits against, in

//
// THE FLOOR IS THE CORRECTION AND WHOSE VARIABILITY IT IS, IS THE RULE.
// [Chain.Predict] returns the variance of the ESTIMATE — how well the median is
// known — which shrinks toward nothing as evidence accumulates. What a wait is
// judged against is how variable ONE DRAW is, which no amount of watching a
// lane shrinks. A controller handed the estimate's spread alone would believe a
// tail impossible and would never hedge the lane that has one.
//
// So draw is a floor and NOT A CONSTANT. [Hierarchy.Draw] answers it from the
// dispersion the sheet published for this pair — the distance between its own
// p50 and p90, which is that lane's measured variability — and [SpreadFloor] is
// the prior for a pair nothing has been published about. One figure under every
// lane said instead that every lane's tail is the worst tail on the sheet: the
// lane `bench/lanelab` proves this against publishes 0.577 nats, and was waited
// against one.

// Hierarchy is the belief store's door for everything the controller needs.

// sighting moves the chain and the flat belief together, because two accounts
// of one lane that were updated separately would disagree the first time one of
// them was fixed. [Ledger] answers "which lane" and this answers "how long",
// and the registry hands out one object that is both.

	// IT IS THE OTHER HALF OF [Chain.Survival] AND IT IS NOT THE CHAIN'S. A
	// chain holds how well a median is known and that is a belief this process
	// sharpens by watching; how variable one answer is around it is a property
	// of the machine, and the sheet publishes it as the distance between a p50

	//
	// IT IS MEASURED WHERE [Hierarchy.Draw] IS READ, and that is the only
	// difference between them. Nobody publishes how variable a thinking phase
	// is, so [Hierarchy.NoteThinking]'s own observations are the dispersion, and
	// [SpreadFloor] is the prior for a model nothing has been watched of.

	//
	// IT IS ON THIS DOOR RATHER THAN ON [Ledger] because it is the only

	// make a model think less, it can only make the same thought arrive faster,
	// which the rate chain already says. [Hierarchy.Think] is what reads it back,
	// and the two belong to one another — a build that could predict a thinking

// So the assertion is made HERE, once per question, and what a caller outside
// this package sees is a function that answers or says it does not know. The
// transport never learns what a [Chain] is.
