// ── THE BELIEF, AND WHY IT IS A FILTER ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// The thing this package replaces is a strike table: count two slow answers,
// demote; count three, refuse for five minutes. Its notion of slow was a fixed
// two seconds, which is wrong for a hundred-thousand-token prompt and wrong for
// a lane whose normal is four hundred milliseconds, and it forgot everything at
// exit.
//
// A scalar Kalman filter in the log domain answers both complaints with one
// mechanism. LOG DOMAIN because first-token wait and tokens-per-second are
// multiplicative quantities with heavy right tails: taking logs makes the noise
// near-Gaussian and makes "twice as slow" the same size of event everywhere.
// TWO INDEPENDENT SCALARS rather than one two-dimensional filter because the
// two fail for different reasons — queueing before the first token, GPU
// contention during the writing — and coupling them buys a covariance nobody
// can explain.
//
// What the filter gives that the strike table wanted is the INNOVATION: the
// size of (z − X) measured against the spread the filter expected. That is a
// free, calibrated "how surprising was that", relative to what this lane was
// doing ten minutes ago. It is the only notion of slow in this package.

// Posterior is one scalar belief in the log domain: X is the mean of the log of
// the quantity, P the variance of that mean.
//
// The natural-unit reading of X is the MEDIAN, not the mean — exp of the mean
// of a log is a median — and that is deliberate: a median first-token wait is
// what a person experiences, while a log-normal's mean is dragged up by a tail
// that happens one time in a hundred.
//
// A zero Posterior is NO BELIEF and reads as one everywhere: [Posterior.Known]
// is false, [Posterior.Mean] is zero rather than one, and [Posterior.Update]
// adopts its first observation outright instead of averaging with a certainty
// it does not have.
type Posterior struct {
	X float64
	P float64
}

// Known reports whether anything has been believed yet. Variance is strictly
// positive for any real belief — a filter that has seen one observation with
// noise R has P = R — so P at zero is the honest signal for "nothing here".
func (p Posterior) Known() bool { return p.P > 0 }

// Mean is the belief in its natural unit: milliseconds for a first-token
// posterior, tokens per second for a rate one. It is zero when nothing is
// believed, which the emptiness law then renders as nothing at all.

	if !p.Known() {
		return 0
	}
	return math.Exp(p.X)
}

// Quantile is the belief at z standard deviations, in the natural unit:
// Quantile(1.2816) is the p90 and Quantile(-1.2816) the p10.
//
// It is how the tail gets priced. A lane that is fastest at the median and
// among the worst at the ninety-ninth percentile loses here, because a person
// remembers the twelve-second wait and not the four-hundred-millisecond one.

}

// Predict ages a belief that has been sitting still.
//
// THE HALF-LIFE IS A HALF-LIFE OF CONFIDENCE, NOT OF THE ESTIMATE. After one
// half-life with no evidence the variance has doubled, so the information in
// the belief — which is one over the variance — has halved. That is exactly
// what "a ten-minute half-life" should mean and it needs nothing but the
// posterior itself: the estimate is not moved, because we have no reason to
// think a lane got faster or slower, only a reason to be less sure.
//
// A belief therefore never has to be un-demoted. Its variance widens until the
// sheet's pseudo-observation or a sampled draw puts it back in the running,
// which is why there is no penalty box and no cooldown timer anywhere in this
// package. The ledger clamps P at the prior's variance so that ageing can make
// a belief worthless but never worse than the public sheet.
//
// ── AND IT IS BOUNDED, BECAUSE DOUBLING FOREVER REACHES INFINITY (2026-09-10)
//
// The doubling above is unbounded in dt, and a belief left alone long enough
// overflows: P starts near σ² = 0.36 and 2^(dt/10 min) passes the largest float
// there is after about seven days. Nothing stopped it. Every caller that ages a
// pair the sheet publishes no spread for went through [age] with a ceiling of
// zero — so the clamp there was skipped — and the scorer ages beliefs by calling
// this function directly with no clamp at all.
//
// What that cost is written down twice. `+Inf` reached [Posterior.Update],
// where the gain is P/(P+R) — infinity over infinity — and the belief became
// NaN; NaN passes every `> ceiling` test as false, so nothing repaired it, and
// the belief file then refused to compact for days on `json: unsupported value:
// NaN`. On the way to that, a P of about 673 — eleven half-lives of a lane
// nobody sent to — priced acting at exp(μ + P/2) and put 1.99e+146 in the
// `cost_s` column of the model-call log.
//
// SO WIDENING STOPS WHERE A BELIEF STOPS SAYING ANYTHING. Past [MaxSpread] the
// tail is already wider than any decision could use, and every further doubling
// buys nothing but a bigger number for the arithmetic downstream to break on.

// MaxSpread is the widest a belief is ever allowed to become: sixteen times the
// variance of a lane nobody has ever measured.
//
// IT IS A FLOOR UNDER THE ARITHMETIC AND NOT A JUDGEMENT. Every ceiling that
// decides anything is tighter than this one — [age] clamps at the sheet's own
// weight and [ledger.stale] at each level's — and this is only what stops the
// one unbounded expression in the package from reaching a number no reader of
// it can hold. At σ ≈ 2.4 the p90 of a belief is already twenty-one times its
// median, which is the formal spelling of "this says nothing"; sixteen times
// further would say nothing sixteen times louder.
const MaxSpread = 16 * defaultSpread * defaultSpread

// Update folds one observation z — already in the log domain — with observation
// noise R, and returns the posterior that results.
//
// R is where the judgement lives and it is the caller's: a first-token
// measurement behind a sixty-thousand-token prompt is a noisy claim about the
// lane, because most of that wait was prefill nobody's endpoint could avoid, so
// it arrives with a large R. A probe measured on ten tokens is the sharpest
// claim there is and arrives with a small one. The sheet arrives as a
// pseudo-observation with R inflated by a constant, so that a public aggregate
// keeps pulling the belief toward reality without drowning our own answers.
//
// ON A POSTERIOR THAT KNOWS NOTHING the gain would be zero and the observation
// would be discarded, which is the one thing a first measurement must not be.
// An unknown belief is an infinitely wide prior, and the limit of the update
// there is to adopt the observation outright.
//
// AND A BELIEF THAT IS NOT A NUMBER IS NO BELIEF. [Posterior.Known] is P > 0,
// which is TRUE of +Inf and FALSE of NaN — so an overflowed belief used to walk
// straight into the gain below as if it were measured, come out NaN, and then
// read as unknown everywhere forever without any path ever repairing it. It is
// read here as what it is: nothing was known, so the observation is adopted
// outright, exactly as it is for a lane this process has never sent to.

// 0.90. So a gate on the mean refused every lane of every model on the first
// request of every process, for lack of evidence rather than for cause, and the
// refusal was ABSORBING: a lane outside the candidate set is never sent to, so
// it never earns the ninth good answer that would have let it back. The
// simulator found it in one run (docs/design/routing/provider-routing.md, Part III).
//
// The bound asks the question the gate means to ask — "could this lane be good
// enough?" rather than "is its point estimate above the line?" — and it is what
// makes the gate's evidence requirement honest: Beta(8, 1) is bounded near
// certainty and passes, and it takes real refusals to pull the bound under the
// line, because a wide belief is not a bad one.
//
// The bound is the normal approximation to the Beta quantile,
// mean ± z·√(mean(1−mean)/(A+B+1)), clamped to the unit interval. It is exact
