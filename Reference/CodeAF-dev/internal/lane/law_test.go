// the build holds. Each law is named as a sentence and each of them fails with
// a file name and a line number, in the convention `structure_test.go` set.
//
// SEVERAL OF THESE ARE RED ON PURPOSE. They were written before the work they
// describe, so that the work has somewhere to land and so that "done" is a
// thing the build says rather than a thing somebody claims. The design's "laws
// currently red" section lists which, and a lane of the build plan turns each
// of them green.

// installed is the controller factory, or a skipped-forward failure saying why
// there is not one. Every behavioural law here needs one and none of them may
// invent one, because a law that passes against a test double is a law about
// the double.
