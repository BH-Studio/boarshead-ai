// A TEST NEVER READS THE STATE OF WHOEVER RAN IT.
//
// This package keeps two files under the state root — the belief store
// (`v3/lanes.json`) and one sheet cache per model (`v3/lanes/{model}.json`) —
// and both resolve their own path when nobody hands them one, which is exactly
// right for the product and exactly wrong under `go test`: a test binary
// inherits the CODEAF_HOME of whoever started it, so a test that asks this
// package a question is answered out of the person's own router state.
//
// It happened. `TestAnEmptyLedgerIsAnEmptyChoice` asserts the honest answer on
// a fresh machine — no beliefs, therefore no opinion — and it went red for good
// on this build box the first time a real run wrote
// `~/.codeaf/v3/lanes/deepseek%2Fdeepseek-v4-flash.json` (#475). Nothing in the
// test named a file, or a home, or a sheet: it built a chooser with a fake
// ledger, and the chooser reached the live registry's sheet for the rows the
// ledger had none of. That is the whole class — the reach-through nobody wrote
// down — and it is why the guard cannot live in the test.
//
// THE GATE IS AT THE RESOLUTION SEAM rather than in the tests, for the reason
// #352 gave about the call log: a test-side fix protects the tests somebody
// remembered, and a test written next month starts unprotected again. The law
// this directory already carried (`TestNoTestWritesTheRealHome`) is syntactic —
// it asks whether a test function mentions the registry — and a chooser that
// reaches the registry from inside slips straight past it. There are exactly
// two places a path is resolved here, and a gate on them holds for tests
// nobody has written yet.
//
// A TEST THAT WANTS A FILE STILL GETS ONE, because what is refused is an
// INHERITED root and never a root the test chose. The deliberate ways through
// are acts rather than omissions, and all three already exist: `t.Setenv` of
// CODEAF_HOME to a directory of the test's own (which is what most of this
// directory's tests do), `store.at` for the belief file, and `sheet.cacheIn`
// for the cache. None of them can be reached by forgetting.
var underTest = testing.Testing()

// inheritedRoot is the state root this process was STARTED with, read once at
// package initialisation — before any test has run, because `t.Setenv` can only
// happen inside one.
//
// The capture is the whole difference between this gate and the call log's,
// which compares against the live root instead. That is right for a log nobody
// wants under test and wrong here: a lane test that points CODEAF_HOME at its
// own `t.TempDir()` and then reads the store back is doing the correct thing,
// and a gate that watched the live root would refuse it. So what is refused is
// the root nobody chose.
//
// IT IS THE STATE ROOT AND NOT ALSO THE PROFILE ROOT, which is where this gate
// differs from the call log's second time. That log resolves under
// CODEAF_PROFILE_DIR, so a gate watching only the state root would have written
// into a person's ledger whenever the profile moved out from under it. Nothing
// in this package resolves under the profile: both files here are [home.Join]
// and nothing else. Naming a root this package cannot reach would buy no
// protection and cost a real one — a test that points CODEAF_HOME at a
// `t.TempDir()` which happens to sit under an inherited CODEAF_PROFILE_DIR has
// chosen its root, and would have been refused it.
var inheritedRoot = home.Dir()

// stateFile names a file under the state root, and answers "" for one that
// would land in a root a test binary merely inherited.
//
// Both this package's readers already treat "" as "there is nothing there" —
// the store answers [ErrNoStore] and the sheet reads no cache — so the refusal
// needs no new state anywhere: a test binary simply runs on a machine that has
// never routed anything, which is the state every one of these tests describes.
//
// Outside a test binary it is [home.Join] and nothing else: the product's files
// resolve exactly as they always have.
