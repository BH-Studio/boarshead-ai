// ── WHAT THE ACCOUNT ITSELF WILL NOT REACH ──────────────────────────────────
//
// The serving set's negative half (sheet.go's [RefuseServing]) is a fact about
// ONE MODEL: this router will not serve that model from that machine, for now.
// There is a second kind of refusal that is not about a model at all, and it
// was filed as though it were.
//
// ── THE MEASURED FAILURE (2026-09-09 → 2026-09-10) ──────────────────────────
//
// The owner's account has the router's "paid model training" privacy switch
// off, which removes every machine that trains on paid inputs from EVERY
// request the account makes, whatever the model. The router says so when a
// request's whole set was such a machine:
//
//	0 endpoints out of 1 requested are available matching your guardrail
//	restrictions and data policy. … Paid model training violation (account
//	settings): 1 endpoint excluded; configurable at …/settings/privacy
//
// and its metadata carries the same fact as structure —
// `ineligibility_reasons: [{reason: "paid-model-training-violation-by-account",
// configure_url: …}]`. This process filed it as a thirty-minute refusal of ONE
// lane for ONE model, in memory: so the next model demanded the same machine and
// paid the same 404, and a fresh process sixteen hours later paid it again for
// the same machine (Wafer, twice; Fireworks and DeepSeek inside one race). And
// it was worse than a wasted round trip: a race that walks from one of these
// refusals to the next spends its arms on machines that were never going to be
// asked.
//
// ── THE LAW ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A MACHINE THE ACCOUNT'S OWN SETTINGS EXCLUDE IS EXCLUDED FOR EVERY MODEL, AND
// THE NEXT PROCESS KNOWS IT. [Serves] reads this set for every model, so the
// frontier never ranks the machine, the walk never demands it and the refusal
// door never predicts a walk onto it. It is written to the state root beside the
// lane ledger, because the router's own sentence says the fact lives in a
// SETTING and a setting outlives a process.
//
// IT IS NEVER A BAN. Two things take a machine back: [accountExclusionHold]
// passing, and — sooner — any answer that machine SERVES for this process
// ([ClearAccountExclusion]), which is the router telling us the setting has changed.
// Neither costs a request: a request that does not demand anything can still
// be served from an excluded machine by the router's own free choice (the
// endpoint ladder's first rung is exactly such a request), so the set can only
// ever keep a machine from being DEMANDED, never from answering.

// accountExclusionHold is how long an account's exclusion of a machine is
// believed without being heard again.
//
// A DAY, because what it records is a SETTING. Half an hour — the serving set's
// hold — is right for a router's view of one model, which really does move, and
// wrong for a switch on a settings page: it bought the same 404 back at the top
// of every conversation. A day is long enough that no working day pays it twice
// and short enough that a person who flips the switch without this process
// seeing an answer from that machine has it back by tomorrow.

// refusal door) and by nothing else. An unnamed lane writes nothing: an
// exclusion credited to nobody would take a machine away from nobody, and a
// blank key in the file would be a row nobody can read.
//
// THE WRITE IS SYNCHRONOUS AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. It happens at most once per
// machine per [accountExclusionHold] — the whole point of the set is that the
