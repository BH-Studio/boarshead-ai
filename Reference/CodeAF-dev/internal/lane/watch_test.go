//
// WHAT WAS WRONG. `SpendUSD = GiveUp / λ` divided by a figure that is smaller
// for a call nobody is watching, so an unwatched second came out four times
// dearer than a watched one: `talk` was allowed $1.00 to rescue itself and
// `leaf.unattended` $12.00, `standing` $24.00. The one rail in front of a rescue
// was sized in the opposite order to who is waiting, which is the deleted
// window's own defect — refusing the request that needed it — with the priority
// reversed rather than removed.
//
// WHY THE LAW IS NOT "EVERY WATCHED ROLE AFFORDS MORE THAN EVERY UNWATCHED
// ONE". Patience varies thirty-fold WITHIN each group — `recall` waits 18
// seconds and `talk` ninety, `probe` 45 and `standing` nine minutes — so no
// per-second price can make the totals order that way, and a price that did
// would be saying a nine-minute wait is worth less than an eighteen-second one.
