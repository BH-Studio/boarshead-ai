// ── λ: WHAT A SECOND IS WORTH ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One number, in SECONDS PER DOLLAR, and it is not a setting. Three questions
// this build can already answer decide it:
//
//   - Is a person watching this stream right now? Then their attention has a
//     wall value, and at a nominal rate a dollar buys something like ninety
//     seconds of it — in plain terms, spend up to a cent to save a second.
//   - Is this call on the critical path of a task? Then λ is the wall value of
//     the whole task, because the person waits for its end. Off the path with
//     slack to spare, λ falls to zero and price wins outright.
//   - Is there a deadline? Then λ rises as it nears, because a missed deadline
//     is a step cost rather than a slow one.
//
// WHY NOT A SLIDER. A "speed versus cost" control asks the person to state λ
// once, for every future request, when the graph already knows it per request
// and the answer differs by two orders of magnitude between a chat turn and a
// background node. The routing row keeps its three words and gains this
// meaning: `price` sets λ to zero for everything, `latency` computes it, `off`
// stays total.
//
// The other half of this file is the PRICE the λ is spent against, and it is
// cache-aware for the reason Part II §3 of the design gives: the cheapest lane
// on the sheet is not the cheapest lane for a request whose prefix another lane
// already holds, and a router that ignored that would flap between two equal
// lanes forever, paying a cold prefix each time.
//
// Nothing here reads a clock: every moment arrives as an argument.

	// AttentionValue is λ for a person sitting in front of an empty line, in

	// NINETY IS AN HOURLY RATE DIVIDED THROUGH. At a nominal $40 an hour a
	// second of somebody's attention is worth about a hundredth of a cent, so a
	// dollar buys ninety seconds of waiting back. It is stated once, here,
	// because every other value of time in this package is expressed as a
	// multiple of it.

	// TaskWallValue is λ for a call on the critical path of a task.
	//
	// IT IS THE WALL VALUE OF THE WHOLE TASK, because the person waits for the
	// task's end and not for this node's. For v1 it is the attention value: the
	// build does not yet carry a per-task worth, and inventing one would be a
	// number nobody measured deciding what to pay. When the plan learns what a
	// task is worth to whoever asked for it, this is the constant that goes.
	TaskWallValue = AttentionValue

	// DeadlineUrgencyCap bounds what a deadline may do to λ. Four times the
	// task's wall value is a deadline already missed or about to be; above it
	// the arithmetic stops describing a trade and starts describing a panic,
	// and a router that pays any price is a router with no opinion at all.
	DeadlineUrgencyCap = 4.0

	// UnattendedValue is the floor under λ for a call nobody is sitting in front
	// of: a quarter of a person's attention. ZERO WAS THE OLD ANSWER AND IT WAS
	// MEASURED WRONG. At λ = 0 the score is dollars alone and the frontier keeps
	// only lanes within 1.25× the cheapest, so on 2026-09-10 every task node for
	// deepseek-v4.1-flash went to the two cheapest lanes — one answering 17% of
	// the time at 22 tok/s, the other 14% — while the lane at 234 tok/s cost six
	// hundredths of a cent more per thousand tokens and was never a candidate.
	// The replay of that day (docs/design/routing/ASSESSMENT-20260911.md) put
	// the router's mean regret at 31.9 s against 0.4 s with λ held above zero. A
	// task the person is not watching still ends when its slowest call ends,
	// and its calls still pay for every refusal, so its seconds are not free;
	// they are worth less than watched ones, and this is how much less. The
	// routing row's `price` word still means exactly zero, because that is a
	// person saying so (internal/provider's laneValueOfTime).

//
// A DEADLINE CAN LIFT ANY OF THEM. It is asked last and it takes the larger
// answer, because a missed deadline is a step cost rather than a slow one:
// urgency is how many times over the remaining time the expected work is, and
// once the work no longer fits, λ is at least the task's wall value.

// ([PerceivedSeconds]). A request that states neither is priced on its prompt
// alone, which is the honest answer for a call whose answer length nobody has
// estimated.
//
// A lane that publishes no cache tariff bills its cached tokens at the fresh
// rate here. That is not a guess: it is what an endpoint with no cache discount
// charges, and it is what makes the incumbent lane's advantage disappear
// exactly when the incumbent has no cache to hold.

// green. λ is SECONDS PER DOLLAR, so dollars times λ is seconds and dollars
// divided by λ is dollars squared per second — a quantity of nothing, about
// eight thousand times too small at the attention value, which makes the price
// term round to zero beside any wait at all. The symptom is a router that says
// it prices money and does not: with [PerceivedSeconds] corrected so that two
// lanes above reading speed feel identical, price is the ONLY thing left to
// separate them on a talk turn, and a price term that cannot be felt turns that
// decision into sampling noise. The direction is fixed by the design's own
// sentence — a dollar buys ninety seconds, so spend up to a cent to save a
// second — and by [underPriceCeiling], which goes the other way (seconds into
// dollars) and divides. See docs/design/routing/provider-routing.md, Part III.
//
// THE TWO CASES ARE DIFFERENT UNITS ON PURPOSE. With nobody waiting, a second
// is worth nothing; the honest score is the money, and perceived time is then
// only a tiebreak ([Chooser.Choose] applies it). With somebody waiting, one
// dollar is worth λ seconds by construction, so the two terms are commensurable
// and the sum is a time.
