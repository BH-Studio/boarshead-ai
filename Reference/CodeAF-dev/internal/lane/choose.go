// ── THE CHOICE: A GATE, A FRONTIER, AND ONE SCALAR ──────────────────────────
//
// Four things are wanted at once — cheap, quick to start, quick to finish,
// right — and a fixed weight over them is a guess about a trade the person
// never made. The design's move is to stop guessing the weight and DERIVE it
// from the request: the price of a second is a property of who is waiting and
// what their wait costs (λ, in [Request.ValueOfTime]), and the value of
// throughput saturates at reading speed ([PerceivedSeconds]). With those two
// facts the four objectives collapse to one scalar PER REQUEST, different for a
// talk turn and for a background node, and the Pareto frontier over lanes is
// only the candidate set that scalar chooses from.
//
// The order is fixed and each step has a law:
//
//  1. GATE — deterministic, never sampled. Tools, output ceiling, context,
//     quantization, uptime, and the quality posterior against QualityNeed. A
//     gate drop is never a sampled event: a lane that would drop the tool call
//     is a wrong answer rather than a slow one.
//  2. PRUNE — drop a lane another lane beats on all of first token, rate,
//     price and quality at the p75. Scored at p75 rather than the mean so that
//     an UNCERTAIN lane stays in: it might be good, and that is the only kind
//     of exploration worth paying for.
//  3. SCORE — perceived seconds plus price through λ, Thompson-sampled from
//     the posteriors, with the sampling spread scaled by the horizon.
//  4. ASK — Order is the survivors by sampled score, with fallbacks left on.
//
// THE SCORE'S UNIT FOLLOWS λ, and this is the one place the contract's own
// wording needs reading twice. With somebody waiting (λ > 0) a dollar is worth
// λ seconds by construction, the two terms are commensurable, and [Scored.Score]
// is the seconds its documentation describes. With nobody waiting (λ = 0) a
// second is worth nothing, dividing by λ is a division by zero dressed up as a
// preference, and the honest score is the MONEY — perceived time then only
// breaks its ties. Both are "lower is better" and neither is ever compared with
// the other, because one request has one λ.
//
// AN EMPTY LEDGER GETS AN EMPTY CHOICE. Nothing here invents a belief about a
// lane nobody has measured and no sheet has described: with no beliefs for the
// model the answer is the zero [Choice], the transport sends exactly what it
// sent before this package existed, and the first answer that comes back is
// what teaches this file anything at all.
//
// Nothing in this file, in frontier.go or in value.go may read a clock. The
// moment is [Request.Now] and a structural test in this directory enforces it,
// because a choice that reads the wall is a choice no test can pin.

	// explores in proportion to how uncertain it is and is blind to how many
	// decisions are left to profit from what it learns: a three-call session
	// should never explore, a five-hundred-call swarm should explore early. The
	// sampling spread is scaled by min(1, Horizon/50), so a short session
	// chooses its best guess and a long one pays to find out.
	ExplorationHorizon = 50

	// exploreTTFTMultiple bounds exploration by the clock rather than by the
	// belief. A lane may only be sampled INTO the order when its believed
	// first-token wait is within twice the best lane's: a lane at six tokens a
	// second is not explored on somebody's turn however uncertain it is, because
	// what would be learned costs more than it is worth.
	exploreTTFTMultiple = 2.0

	// ignoreTTFTMultiple and ignoreSureVariance are the two halves of a refusal,
	// and it takes both. A lane is named in `provider.ignore` only when it is
	// believed to be more than three times slower to start than the best lane
	// AND the belief is a sure one — a variance under this, which is a spread of
	// about ±65% in the log domain. THE SECOND HALF IS THE POINT: a lane we are
	// merely unlucky with keeps its place, and a refusal expires by the belief
	// widening under [Posterior.Predict] rather than on a timer, which is why
	// there is no penalty box anywhere in this package.
	ignoreTTFTMultiple = 3.0
	ignoreSureVariance = 0.25

	// sheetObservations is how many requests a published percentile row stands
	// for WHEN THE QUESTION IS HOW SURE OF THE LANE'S MEDIAN IT MAKES US.
	//
	// A belief's variance is two different quantities at two different moments,
	// and this is the seam where the difference bites.
	//
	// BEFORE THIS PROCESS HAS MEASURED A LANE, P is whatever the sheet's spread
	// was — and the sheet's spread is the lane's per-request VARIABILITY, the
	// distance between its p50 and its p90 over everybody's prompts. A draw from
	// it is a draw of one imagined request, not of one opinion about a lane, and
	// reordering lanes on an imagined request is paying real money for a coin
	// toss nothing can be learned from: the sheet has already published both
	// medians. So a belief that is still purely the sheet's is drawn narrow.
	//
	// AFTER IT HAS, P is the variance of the MEDIAN — it shrank with each
	// sighting and widens again with [Posterior.Predict] as the last one ages —
	// and a draw from THAT is exactly the question Thompson sampling exists to
	// ask. So a measured belief is drawn at its own full width, which is what
	// lets a lane this process gave up on earn its way back once its spread has
	// grown (`docs/design/routing/provider-routing.md` §5: there is no penalty box). The
	// same file says the same thing from the other side — [predictive] floors
	// this variance back UP for the hedge, because there the per-request
	// question is the right one and P has stopped answering it.
	//
	// [Belief.At] is what separates the two cases: it is zero for a lane only
	// the sheet has ever spoken about. It is a blunt line — a lane with one
	// sighting is still mostly the sheet's — and it is drawn where it is because
	// it is the one fact that is certainly true on either side of it.
	//
	// Sixteen is stated rather than derived, because nothing the router
	// publishes says how many requests are behind a percentile; it is the
	// design's own discount for a public number ([SheetWeight] = 4) squared,
	// which is what turns a weight in the filter's units into a count.
	//
	// It was found by the case in `docs/design/routing/provider-routing.md`, Part III: with
	// two thousand hidden tokens and somebody waiting, Baidu is both quicker and
	// four times cheaper than Cloudflare, and the chooser sent a quarter of
	// those requests to Cloudflare anyway.

// ── THE PREFIX MEMORY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Price is path-dependent because of the prompt cache: the cheapest lane on the
// sheet is not the cheapest lane for a request whose prefix another lane
// already holds. Knowing which lane holds it needs one fact the ledger does not
// carry — WHICH CONVERSATION a lane last served — so it is kept here, next to
// the only code that asks.
//
// IT IS A BELIEF AND NEVER A FACT. A lane that answered this conversation four
// minutes ago probably still has its prefix; it may have evicted it, and the
// only proof either way is the `cached_tokens` of the next answer. Believing it
// wrongly costs one comparison. The alternative — the transport's current
// affinity pin, which puts the incumbent in front unconditionally — cannot be
// argued with by a price at all, which is what this replaces.

// prefixNote is one lane's last conversation, HOW LONG THE PROMPT WAS WHEN IT
// LAST SERVED IT, and when.
//
// THE LENGTH IS THE HALF THIS NOTE USED TO BE MISSING. Without it the only
// honest answer to "how much of this request does that lane hold" was "the
// prefix matched", and the caller turned that into a discount on the WHOLE of
// a request that had since grown. The tokens appended after the lane last
// answered were never sent to it and cannot be in its cache. So the length is
// carried, and it is the length the PROVIDER counted rather than anything this
// process estimated before the send (internal/provider's noteLane): a discount
// granted on a guessed schema size is a discount nobody's usage frame agreed
// to. Zero is "not known", and it earns nothing.

// is a different prompt. Only the next answer's `cached_tokens` settles it.
// What the bound removes is the one error that needed no cache behaviour to be
// wrong — crediting a lane for tokens that were appended after it last spoke.

// ── COLD START: A MODEL NOBODY HAS MEASURED STILL GETS AN ORDER ─────────────
//
// The first request to a (model, lane) pair is the STEADY STATE — a person
// picks a model at runtime, the sheet is half an hour old at best, and the
// ledger has never heard of the machines behind it — and until this the whole
// package refused it: fewer than two beliefs and the answer was the zero
// [Choice]. The measured consequence was a request with no routing opinion AND
// no clock on it, waiting three minutes.
//
// The refusal was right about ONE thing and wrong about the other. An order of
// one is genuinely not a ranking, and sending the name of the only endpoint we
// happen to know exists is a preference for our own ignorance. But "one lane in
// the ledger" was never the same fact as "one lane known": the sheet names
// every machine that serves this model, and the hierarchy knows how quick each
// PROVIDER is from every other model it has served (waiting.go's sum). Both are
// beliefs about lanes; neither was being read.
//
// So the candidate set is widened in three steps, cheapest first, and it stops
// as soon as there is something to rank:
//
//  1. what the ledger holds for this model — the measured account, untouched;
//  2. every lane the SHEET names for this model, fitted from its published
//     percentiles exactly as [Ledger.Prime] would fit them;
//  3. every lane this process has seen serving ANY model, priced from the
//     hierarchy's provider level.
//
// A candidate that comes out of all three with nothing believed about it is
// dropped rather than ranked, because that is the old refusal's true half: a
// name with no belief behind it is not a preference.
//
// AND A MODEL WITH NO SHEET ASKS FOR ONE, on the way past, without waiting:
// [Wanter.Wants] queues it for the beat. That is the one write this path makes
// and it is not a fetch — the law that nothing is fetched on a send path is

//
// ── WHY A DEMAND AND NOT A RANKING ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `provider.order` is ADVICE. With `allow_fallbacks` true the router reads the
// list, weighs it against its own load and price, and is free to serve the
// request from a machine the list never named — which it does, often. Measured
// over ten days of the call log (L10's replay, 2026-09-11): the machine this
// build asked for FIRST served 29 % of the time, while the machine a strict
// preference NAMED served 93 %. Every gate above this line — the capability
// gate, the Pareto prune, the price ceiling, the quality floor, and above all
// [beyondThePatience], which takes out the machines whose expected time to a
// usable answer is longer than this role will wait — spent its evidence on a
// set the router was then free to ignore.
//
// So the admitted set is stated as `provider.only`, which the router may not go
// outside, and the ranking travels inside it as before. What the frontier
// refused is refused, and the cost is accepted and named: a pool whose every
// admitted machine is busy REFUSES and the call walks (internal/lane/control's
// [Next] relaxes the shape, then hands the model to the session) rather than
// being served by whoever happened to be free.
//
// ── WHY TWO ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE THRESHOLD IS THE ROUTER'S OWN RULE AND NOT A NUMBER THIS FILE CHOSE. A
// demand of ONE machine is a pin: `only: [x]` with fallbacks off means the
// request goes to x or it does not go, which is somebody's INSTRUCTION and not a
// belief's opinion — internal/provider builds exactly that object for a person's
// strict pin and for a rescue's arm, and the rest of the build reads a one-wide
// demand as a pin (its `demandedLane`, the single legal same-machine repeat).
// A belief that has admitted one machine has nothing to demand, because
// demanding it would be this build pinning somebody to a machine they never
// asked for; it ranks the one it has and leaves the router its fallbacks.
//
// THE VETOES ARE SUBTRACTED AND NOT SENT BESIDE IT, because `only` and `ignore`
// naming one machine is an empty serving set written by us, in one object, about
// a machine we just asked for — the same rule [refusedInto] keeps one line up
// and internal/provider keeps where it drops the machines that refused a call.
// A machine can be in the frontier and still be vetoed: [ignoredOf] names the
// candidates this process is SURE are far slower than the best, and the ranking
// above only has room for [orderNames] of them.
