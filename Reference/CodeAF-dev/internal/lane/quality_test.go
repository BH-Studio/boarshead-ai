// ── WHAT THE SIMULATOR CORRECTED ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The gate and the ledger's law are the two places this design was wrong in a
// way no unit test of a seam could show, because both failures are about what
// happens over a WHOLE SESSION: a gate that refuses on the first request and
// then never gets the evidence that would reverse it, and a ledger that gets
// faster the more often a lane returns nothing. `bench/lanelab` found both, and
// the tests here are what they became. The argument is in
// docs/design/routing/provider-routing.md, Part III, and in the doc comments on
// [Beta.Upper], [Beta.Toward] and [Ledger.Note].
