// Package lanestub is a fake router with lanes of a scripted speed: the shared
// measuring instrument for everything in `internal/lane`.
//
// ── WHY ONE INSTRUMENT AND NOT FIVE ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Five lanes of work are built against this design at once — the sheet and the
// belief, the choice, the watch, the surface, the ledger and the bench — and
// every one of them needs the same three things to exist before it can be
// tested at all: a sheet with plausible percentiles, a stream that starts when
// it says it will and writes at the rate it says it will, and a way to see what
// went out on the wire. Written five times those would be five slightly
// different routers, and the first disagreement between them would look like a
// bug in the code under test.
//
// So it is written once, here, and it is deliberately a LITTLE more than a
// test fixture: it counts requests and cancels per lane, records the routing
// preference of every ask, and can run on a clock that costs nothing, so a
// scenario scripted in seconds finishes in microseconds.
//
// ── WHAT IT SERVES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//	GET  /api/v1/models/{author}/{slug}/endpoints   the sheet, in the router's
//	                                                own field names
//	GET  /api/v1/models                             a minimal catalog
//	POST /api/v1/chat/completions                   a streamed answer from
//	                                                whichever lane the
//	                                                preference selected
//
// [Server.URL] is what a client's BaseURL is set to; it already carries the
// `/api/v1` the router's own URL carries.
//
// ── TWO THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE WRITING A TEST ────────────────────────────────
//
// FIRST, THIS STUB IS A ROUTER BECAUSE OF WHAT IT ANSWERS AND NOT BECAUSE OF
// WHERE IT LIVES, and a test writes nothing to make that true. It serves an
// endpoints page, and a base that serves one carries a routing preference by
// the router's own contract (issue #419 for the sheet, #433 for the
// preference), so a client pointed at the plain [Server.URL] gets a sheet, a
// frontier, and `provider.order` or `provider.only` on the wire — which is what
// [Server.Preference] is here to read back.
//
// That was not true until those two landed. The transport decided both
// questions from the base URL for `openrouter.ai` or from a model spelled
// `openrouter/…`, a loopback address is neither, and so every test that wanted
// to see a preference on the wire had to dress itself up as the shipped router.
// This stub carried that costume — a second mount under a path spelled
// `/openrouter.ai`, handed out by a second accessor — and it is gone (#426):
// there is one address now, and if a preference does not arrive at it, that is
// the product answering.
//
// SECOND, the fast clock is ONE TIMELINE. Its Wait returns at once and advances
// a shared offset, which is exactly right for a scripted single stream and
// meaningless for two streams in flight at the same time. A hedge test — where
// the whole point is that two requests overlap and one is cancelled — uses the
// real clock with millisecond-scale profiles, which still runs a full scenario
// in well under a second.

	// Reasoning is how many THINKING deltas this lane writes before its first

	// carving has to reach the waiting policy too, or a model that fences its
	// thoughts looks to the controller like a model writing an answer and its
	// silence clock never runs.
	Fenced bool

	//
	// IT EXISTS BECAUSE A SCRIPTED ARM MUST ORDER ITSELF BY A SIGNAL AND NEVER
	// BY ELAPSED TIME. A hedge test that wants the rescue to take the answer is
	// asserting a rule — the first arm to finish cleanly commits — and a stalled
	// arm timed to resume a little after the rescue lands asserts nothing but
	// the slack between two wall-clock figures, which a starved machine eats.

	StallUntil <-chan struct{}

	// asserts the slack between two figures instead of the rule it was written
	// for. Held on a signal the caller itself raises, the order cannot invert.
	//

	// coreweave`. Serving the sheet and the completions from one slice made
	// that state unreachable, so the defect had no replication a stranger
	// could run.

	// A SheetOnly lane therefore appears in [Lane.row] exactly like any other
