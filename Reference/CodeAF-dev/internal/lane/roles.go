// ── ROLES: WHO IS ASKING, AND WHAT THAT IS WORTH ────────────────────────────
//
// Every model call in this build is made ON SOMEBODY'S BEHALF, and the four
// numbers that decide how it is routed are all consequences of that one fact:
// what a second of its wait is worth (λ), how sure we have to be the answer is
// usable (QualityNeed), how many more calls there are to learn from (Horizon),
// and whether a person is watching this particular stream (Visible).
//
// Until this table those four were decided at the call site, separately, by
// whoever wrote it. A talk turn said `IntentInteractive` and computed λ from
// `lane.Lambda(true, false, 0, 0, 0)`; a standing run said `IntentBackground`
// and computed nothing; the memory reflex said nothing at all and inherited
// whatever the surrounding context happened to carry. Three sites, three
// answers, and the first time one of them was fixed the other two drifted —
// which is the same argument the response boundary and the lane registry are
// both written to (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md Decisions 8 and 10).
//
// SO THE NUMBERS LIVE HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE. A call site names its role; it
// does not name a λ, an intent, a quality bar or a horizon. A structural test
// fails the build on a call site that reaches past this table for one of them.
//
// AND `Visible` IS THE ONE A PERSON FEELS. A conversation makes several calls
// per turn that are nobody's business but the machine's — a title, a memory
// reflex, a reply check on the reflex tier — and until this field the status
// line drew whichever of them answered last, so a person watching a slow talk
// answer was shown the lane and the throughput of a naming errand that had
// nothing to do with it. Only a visible role owns the phase clock.

// Role is who a model call is being made for.

//
// RE-MEASURED ON 2026-09-10 AND KEPT, against 16,427 finished attempts and the
// 10,028 of them that recorded a first token (the reading is beside this wave
// as `af-rec-r4.patience.md`). A watched turn's first token is 1.6s at the
// median, 8.4s at the ninetieth and 13.1s at the ninety-fifth, so ten seconds
// is this build's own ninety-second percentile — which is where Dean and
// Barroso's rule for a hedged request ("issue the second near the ninety-fifth
// percentile of the expected latency, and one or two percent of extra requests
// removes most of the tail") and Nielsen's ten-second limit on holding a
// person's attention land on the same number from opposite directions.
//
// AND FIVE WOULD BE WORSE ON BOTH COUNTS, which is the answer to the obvious
// question. Acting at five seconds touches 28.9% of all calls against 13.9% at
// ten — twice the traffic — and the yield per extra request FALLS, from 22.1
// rescues per hundred to 17.6, because under ten seconds almost everything
// still silent is an ordinary call in progress rather than one in trouble. The
// knee, where silence stops being normal and starts predicting failure, is
// between ten and fifteen seconds: of the calls still silent at 5s, 10s, 15s

// half-minute of a dead cursor. The ten points between sixty and ninety are
// exactly where the SECOND MACHINE lands, which is the other fact from the same
// reading: 126 of those 167 winning chains used two distinct machines and only
// 41 won on one. So ninety seconds is one fair try at every model in the chain

// SpreadFloor is how variable ONE ANSWER from a pair is taken to be when

// well the median is known — and it shrinks toward nothing after a few dozen
// observations. What a wait is judged against is how variable ONE DRAW is,
// which never shrinks below the lane's own variability, and a controller handed
// the estimate's spread would believe a tail impossible and would never hedge
// the lane that has one.
//
// AND IT IS A PRIOR ABOUT ONE DRAW RATHER THAN A FLOOR UNDER EVERY LANE, which
// is the rule and not the figure. One nat is the shape the measured sheet
// published on its WORST lanes — a p90 about three and a half times the p50 —
// and the sheet publishes each lane's own: the one §K's rows were proved
// against says 430 ms and 900 ms, which is 0.577. Held under every lane, one
// nat asserted that every lane's tail is the worst tail on the sheet, and
// `bench/lanelab` measured what that cost — a healthy talk turn crossed the
// inequality at the action floor, on every request that had not started by
// then. So a lane's own published dispersion is the floor wherever there is one
// ([Hierarchy.Draw]) and this is the prior for where there is not, which is the
// law the rest of this package keeps everywhere: a measured thing outranks a
// prior, and a prior is what an unmeasured thing gets instead of a certainty.
//
// AND WHERE NOTHING IS PUBLISHED, WHAT IS OBSERVED OUTRANKS IT TOO. A thinking
// phase has no sheet row of any kind, so this prior stood under the duration
// clock permanently and its abnormality gate could never close. It is now what
// the think chain's own dispersion account starts from and shrinks away from as
// thoughts are folded in ([chains.draw]), which is the same law again: a
// measured thing outranks a prior, whoever measured it.

// believes that acts on the first draw that is a little late. This is a p90 a

// THE PATIENCE COLUMN WAS RE-MEASURED ON 2026-09-10. Each multiplier is a

// against a watched turn's ninetieth at 8.4s; the unattended 3 is thirty seconds
// against a task node's ninety-seventh (its ninety-fifth is 17.3s and its
// ninety-ninth 58.2s); standing's 6 is sixty seconds, just past that
// ninety-ninth; and the probe's 0.5 is five seconds against a reflex's
// ninety-eighth (ninetieth 0.9s, ninety-ninth 7.2s). Nobody watches an
// unattended call, so the cost of waiting on one is zero and the cost of acting
// is money — which is why the patient roles act at the ninety-seventh and the
// watched one at the ninetieth.
//
// TWO OF THEM MOVED ON 2026-09-11, AND BOTH MOVED FOR ONE REASON: A CEILING
// OUTSIDE ITS OWN CALLER'S WINDOW CAN NEVER FIRE.
//
//   - RECALL, 1 → 0.2. Its caller (internal/reflex's Route) bounded the whole
//     routing pass at this role's CEILING, which made the two numbers the same
//     number: the hazard controller was told to act on silence at exactly the
//     instant the call was killed, so a recall on a slow machine was never once
//     moved to a fast one. The 2026-09-11 census measured the consequence —
//     sixteen recalls, mean 4.3s, max 10.7s, served by DekaLLM at a median of
//     5.5s and Io Net at 4.3s while DeepInfra answered the same role in 1.7s.
//     THE QUANTITY IS THE EARLIEST MOMENT AT WHICH SILENCE STOPS BEING NORMAL
//     FOR THIS ROLE: above the fastest measured machine's median answer, so a
//     healthy one is never cut mid-answer, and below the slow ones', so a slow
//     one is always moved off. That interval is (1.7s, 4.3s) and two seconds is
//     its low end — the soonest this can act without acting on a machine that is
//     working. The give-up that scales with it is eighteen seconds, and the
//     caller now reads THAT as its window so the rescue has somewhere to land.
//   - JUDGE, 6 → 1. Sixty seconds was outside every window its callers set, so
//     the same thing was true: nothing was ever moved off a silent judge machine,
//     and the 2026-09-11 census has four mark readings dying at 30,001–30,002 ms
//     having decided nothing.
//     THE QUANTITY IS THE SAME ONE RECALL'S IS, read against a caller's window
//     rather than a machine's median: the ceiling must be LATE ENOUGH that a
//     healthy machine is never abandoned mid-answer — above the measured first
//     token, 8.4s at the ninetieth — and EARLY ENOUGH that a second machine can
//     still answer one inside the window the caller allows: that window less the
//     same 8.4s. The tightest window that constrains it is the pre-turn route
//     read's twenty seconds, so the interval is (8.4s, 11.6s), and ten seconds is
//     in it and is [VisiblePatience] itself, so the ceiling needs no figure of its
//     own. The give-up that scales with it is ninety seconds, above every
//     caller's own bound, which is what a give-up is for.
//     THE GUARDIAN'S TEN SECONDS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE WINDOWS, and the reason is
//     the reason it is the one named exception everywhere else in this wave: when
//     it goes quiet the fall-through is to ASK THE PERSON, which is a better
//     answer than a second machine's guess and costs nothing. There is nothing a
//     rescue could buy inside that window, so it does not bound this column.
