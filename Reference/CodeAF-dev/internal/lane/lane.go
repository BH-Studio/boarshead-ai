// Package lane is what this build believes about the machines behind a model.
//
// ── WHY THERE IS A PACKAGE AT ALL ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A model id is an address; the LANE is the machine. One model id is served by
// a dozen endpoints that differ by 7× on the wait before the first token and by
// 12× on how fast they write, at roughly the same price — and they differ in
// CAPABILITY too, so the fastest of them may be the one that drops the tool
// call. Choosing among them is a bigger speed lever than choosing the model,
// and until this package nothing in the build held an opinion about it that
// survived either a restart or a request.
//
// The package holds the opinion and nothing else. It has no transport: it never
// opens a connection, never reads a clock of its own, and never draws anything.
// A sighting is handed to it, a request is asked of it, and what comes back is
// a preference some other layer puts on a wire. That boundary is the whole
// design — see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, "Lanes" — and four structural tests in
// this directory hold it.
//
// ── THE LAWS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// NO FETCH ON THE SEND PATH. The sheet is refreshed on a beat, never by a
// request that is about to be sent. A missing sheet means "no prior, use the
// belief alone" — it never means "wait while I go and look".
//
// EVERY NUMBER A PERSON SEES IS THE POSTERIOR. The sheet is a thirty-minute
// aggregate over everybody's prompts; our own sightings are about our prompts
// from our region. Both are evidence and neither is truth, so what a picker
// shows is the belief that combined them, never the raw sheet row.
//
// QUALITY IS A GATE AND NEVER A WEIGHT. A lane that drops tool calls, truncates
// or returns JSON the decoder refuses leaves the candidate set. Weighing
// quality against price is how a router learns to ship wrong answers cheaply.
//
// A HEDGE IS A MEASUREMENT. The second request a slow stream earns is also the
// only cheap way to learn what the alternative lane would have done, so its
// result is fed back as a sighting like any other.
//
// NO FIXED THRESHOLDS. The four constants the strike ledger ran on — two
// seconds, thirty tokens a second, fifteen seconds, two strikes — are what this
// package exists to retire. Slow means "surprising for this lane, ten minutes
// ago", which is a number the posterior already carries.

// ── WHAT A LANE IS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// ID names one machine serving one model.
//
// Both halves are needed and neither is enough. The same endpoint serves many
// models at different speeds, and the same model is served by endpoints that
// have nothing in common, so a belief keyed on either alone is a belief about
// an average nobody ever waits on.
//
// Lane is spelled exactly as the wire spelled it — the `provider` field of a
// streamed chunk, the `provider_name` of a sheet row. Nothing in this package
// knows a vendor's name; every name in it arrived from the wire a moment ago.
type ID struct {

// Zero reports whether the id names nothing. A sighting that could not say who
// served it carries a zero id, and a zero id is never written to the ledger:

// fact about a machine that was not involved.

// ── A TIER IS NOT A DEPLOYMENT ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `moonshotai/kimi-k3:high` and `moonshotai/kimi-k3` are ONE MODEL served by
// ONE SET OF MACHINES. The suffix says how hard to think, or how the router
// should sort what it already serves; the endpoints page answers the same
// seventeen lanes for both, and it answers them under the bare id. A belief
// filed under the suffixed id is therefore a belief about a sheet nobody
// fetched — which is exactly how a machine holding a fresh seventeen-lane
// sheet in memory answered a request with no opinion at all, and sent it to
// whatever the router's own sort picked.
//
// THE LIST IS CLOSED, and it is closed for the reason `internal/tui2/modelui`
// closes its effort words: an open rule would read ":free" as a tier and credit
// a free endpoint's wait to the paid lane of the same name, which is a
// DIFFERENT DEPLOYMENT wearing the same word. A suffix this build has not been
// taught keeps its own sheet and its own beliefs — the safe way to be wrong.

// minute at about four tokens to three words; it is a property of people and
// not a dial, which is why it is stated once, here.

//

// arrives costs them the time it takes to read it no matter which lane wrote
// it: at the reading rate that is visible/ReadRate seconds, and NO ROUTER CAN
// REMOVE IT. What a router can remove is the part of the wait where the reader
// has caught up with the writer, which is the difference between the two rates
// and nothing else. A lane at or above the reading rate therefore contributes
// no visible wait at all, and two lanes above it are the SAME SPEED to the
// person — the fact the whole objective is built on.
//
// Counting the reading time (as `visible/min(rate, ReadRate)` did) put a large
// constant into every candidate's score. It changed no ranking, but it made
// every ratio a simulator or a ship gate computed from these numbers — "the
// wait improved by 30%" — a ratio of mostly reading, which is how a router with
