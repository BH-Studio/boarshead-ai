// every chunk. Until this pair the watch went on judging the stream against the
// belief of the lane at the HEAD of the order, so a stream served by somebody
// else was measured against a machine that was never asked — and a lane the
// ledger knows nothing about left the test switched off entirely, which is the
// state the reported stall sat in.

// acted is the moment a watch first says to do something, in milliseconds from
// the request, or −1 when nothing is ever done about it.
