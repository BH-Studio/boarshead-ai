// ── THE FOUR LEVELS, AND WHY A BELIEF IS A SUM ──────────────────────────────
//
// `waiting.go` states the contract this file implements and the reasoning
// behind it: a belief about a pair is not one history but four, summed,
//
//	ln T(model, lane)  =  μ  +  a[lane]  +  b[model]  +  e[model, lane]
//
// and the whole of cold start falls out of it. What is here is the arithmetic
// — how an observation is shared out between the four, how each of them
// forgets at its own rate, and how a step change in one deployment is caught
// without slandering the three levels it says nothing about.
//
// ── THE FOLD IS ONE SCALAR KALMAN UPDATE ON A DIAGONAL STATE ────────────────
//
// The prediction is the sum, so the innovation variance is the sum, and each
// level's gain is ITS OWN SHARE OF THE SURPRISE:
//
//	ŷ = Σ X_i     S = Σ P_i + R     K_i = P_i / S
//	X_i ← X_i + K_i·(z − ŷ)         P_i ← P_i·(1 − K_i)
//
// Eight lines of arithmetic with the property the design needs: a level that
// is already certain absorbs almost none of a surprise and a level that knows
// nothing absorbs almost all of it. The first sighting of a provider nobody
// has measured moves a[lane] a long way and μ hardly at all; the thousandth
// moves e and nothing else. No level is ever moved by an observation that says
// nothing about it — the sheet is published per model, so it moves b and e and
// leaves μ and a alone, because one refresh may not move every belief this
// process holds.
//
// ── WHAT A PRIOR IS, AND WHY IT AGES ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A level nobody has moved yet is not a hole: it is the prior, a spread wide
// enough to cover what the measured world does, held from the first moment
// this process looked at anything. It ages like every other belief, because a
// process that has been running for a day without one sighting knows less
// about the world's pace than it did when it opened — and it stops at
// [SheetWeight] times the prior's own variance, which is the point at which
// the prior would outweigh what is held. Ageing may make a belief worthless;
// it may not make it worse than free. That is [age]'s law, said four times
// with four half-lives.

// levelSpread is σ at each level, in nats of log-spread, for a process that has
// seen nothing.
//
// They are priors to be fitted and they are guesses about HOW MUCH OF THE
// VARIATION LIVES WHERE, not about how fast any lane is: first-token medians
// across the seventeen measured lanes of one model span ln(3030/430) = 1.95
// nats, most of that spread is between providers rather than within one, and
// what is left after a provider and a model have spoken is the deployment.
var levelSpread = [Levels]float64{1.2, 0.9, 0.6, 0.5}

// levelHalfLife is how fast each level's fact really turns over: one
// deployment's queue in minutes, a provider's fleet in the half hour a capacity
// event lasts, a model's size and shape in hours, and the world's pace in a day.
//
// They are the only numbers here that are guesses about how fast the world
// changes rather than about how fast a lane is, and `bench/lanelab` fits them
// against replayed sightings.
var levelHalfLife = [Levels]time.Duration{
	LevelWorld: 24 * time.Hour,
	LevelLane:  30 * time.Minute,
	LevelModel: 6 * time.Hour,
	LevelPair:  10 * time.Minute,
}

// cusumSlack and cusumAlarm are the standard slack and alarm of a one-sided
// CUSUM: enough to detect a one-σ step in about eight observations without
// firing on ordinary noise. Both are priors to be fitted in the simulator.
const (
	cusumSlack = 0.5
	cusumAlarm = 4.0
)

// everywhere is the world level's own key. μ is ONE NUMBER FOR EVERYTHING, so
// the level that holds it has exactly one slot; naming it makes "this
// observation moves the world's pace" and "this one does not" the same kind of
// statement as every other level's.
const everywhere = "world"

// worldPace is where each quantity's μ starts before anything has been timed:
// the middle of the seventeen lanes this design was measured against, in the
// chain's own unit. With σ = 1.2 nats around it the prior covers most of their
// span without claiming to know where in it a given lane sits.
var (
	waitPace  = math.Log(1200) // milliseconds to a first token
	ratePace  = math.Log(25)   // tokens a second
	thinkPace = math.Log(8)    // seconds of a whole thinking phase
)

// subject names what each level of one observation is keyed on. An EMPTY NAME
// IS A LEVEL THIS QUANTITY DOES NOT HAVE — a thinking duration has no provider
// term, because a lane cannot make a model think less — and it is the only
// thing that takes a level out of the sum.
//
// IT IS NOT THE SAME QUESTION AS WHICH LEVELS MAY MOVE. See [absorbs]: every
// level a subject names is PREDICTED FROM, and only some of them absorb.
type subject [Levels]string

// absorbs says which of a subject's levels one observation is entitled to move.
//
// THE TWO ARE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS AND CONFLATING THEM COSTS AN ORDER OF
// MAGNITUDE. A sheet row is published per model, so it may move b[model] and
// e[model, lane] and must not move μ or a[lane] — one refresh moving the world's
// pace would move every belief this process holds. But the number it carries is
// an ABSOLUTE first token, and the belief it is folded into is a SUM. Predicting
// from the two levels it is allowed to move and folding the whole absolute into
// them puts μ's own mean into b and e as well, and [Chain.Predict] then adds μ
// a second time: a lane the sheet published at 430 ms was believed to take eight
// seconds, which is a controller that would wait out a person's whole patience
// on the fastest machine it knows.
//
// So the innovation is against the WHOLE belief, exactly as the design's own
// equations write it — ŷ = Σ X over the levels, S = Σ P + R over the same — and
// the constraint is applied where it belongs: to the gains.
//
// ── AND A PUBLISHED ROW IS AN OFFSET, WHICH IS THE OTHER HALF ───────────────
//
// Which levels may move is one question and HOW MUCH OF THE DIFFERENCE they
// take is another. One of our own sightings is evidence about all four levels
// and each takes its own share, which is the Kalman gain and is right: we do
// not know whether a slow answer means a slow world, a slow provider or a slow
// deployment.
//
// A SHEET ROW IS NOT THAT KIND OF EVIDENCE. It names one pair and states where
// that pair sits, so what is left to learn from it is not "how much of this is
// the world" — it is this deployment's own offset from what the parents already
// say. Sharing it out left the pair believed BETWEEN the world's pace and the
// published one: a lane the sheet published at 430 ms predicted about 1.2 s,
// because μ holds most of the variance and may not move, so the level that may
// took a sixth of the difference. `bench/lanelab` measured what that cost — the
// controller wanted a second request on a lane it had been told was fast.
//
// So a published row's levels take the WHOLE difference between the row and
// what the parents say, and the prediction lands exactly where the sheet put
// it. The variances still shrink by each level's own gain, because how much a
// row TEACHES is a separate question from where it puts the median, and a
// half-hour aggregate at [SheetWeight] teaches little: the belief is centred on
// the sheet and honestly unsure of it, which is what a prior with an honest
// floor was always supposed to mean.

// ── HOW VARIABLE ONE DRAW IS, WHERE NOBODY PUBLISHES IT ─────────────────────

// For a lane the sheet says it — the distance between a published p50 and p90,
// which [Hierarchy.Draw] reads — and for a run of thought NOBODY SAYS IT AT
// ALL. That is why the duration clock stood on [SpreadFloor] for ever: σ was
// the larger of the two terms, the floor was always the larger, and the clock's
// own gate could not close however many thoughts were folded in.
//
// BUT A THING NOBODY PUBLISHES IS STILL OBSERVED. Every thinking duration
// folded through [Hierarchy.NoteThinking] is one draw of exactly the quantity
// in question, so the leaf keeps its own account of them: Welford's count, mean
// and sum of squared deviations, three floats a leaf, folded on the same lock
// as the belief and in the same call.
//
// THE LAW IS THE SAMPLE SPREAD POOLED WITH THE PRIOR, AND FLOORED. n draws
// carry n − 1 degrees of freedom about their own mean and the prior is worth
// one more, so the two are pooled at those weights:
//
//	σ² = (floor² + Σ(z − z̄)²) / n
//
// One draw therefore answers the prior exactly, two identical ones answer it
// divided by √2, and a model whose deliberation really does vary keeps the
// width it really has — a wide sample never sharpens the gate, it only ever
// widens it past the prior. It is floored at [SpreadTightest] because a spread
// of nothing is a claim that a tail is impossible, which is the one thing a
// predictive spread may never make.
