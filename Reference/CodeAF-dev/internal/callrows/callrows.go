// Package callrows reads the model-call log this build always writes
// (`~/.codeaf/logs/calls.jsonl`, internal/calllog) back into rows.
//
// IT IS ONE READER BECAUSE THERE IS ONE FILE. Two instruments now read it —
// cmd/codeaf-census, which prints what went wrong, and cmd/codeaf-replay, which
// asks what a different chooser would have done — and a second reader is a
// second answer to "was this attempt a failure", "which of these two rows is
// the same call" and "what does a torn last line mean". The census had all
// three in its own package and the first replay bench
// (`internal/lane/replay_bench_test.go`, deleted with this package's first
// caller) had its own copy of the first two, already disagreeing about whether
// a hedge's losing arm is a failure. So the reading lives here, once, and an
// instrument built next week starts from the same rows.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE is anything that turns a row into a JUDGEMENT. Which family
// a failure belongs to, which signature it shares with another, what a regret
// is — those are each instrument's own argument about the same bytes, and they
// stay where the argument is made.
