# codeaf as a resident agent — the finalized architecture

This document settles the long-running architecture: one permanent graph, one
lease-elected resident role, and any number of surfaces attached to it. It is
written as a set of decisions, each with the alternative that was rejected and
why. The current single-shot CLI (`codeaf plan` / `codeaf run`) remains a
supported mode throughout.

## The one-sentence design

A single, permanent, append-only task graph lives in `~/.codeaf`; the file is
the truth, no daemon owns it, and any process may hold the one resident role
for that database while every terminal session, API caller, timer, or file
watch remains an attachment to the same graph.

---

## Decision 1 — The store: SQLite (WAL) for the graph, files for the bytes

**Decision.** The graph lives in `~/.codeaf/codeaf.db`, SQLite in WAL mode.
Large payloads — tool observations, artifacts, transcripts — never enter the
database; they live in a content-addressed store (`~/.codeaf/cas/<sha256[0:2]>/<sha256>`)
and per-run workspaces, and the database stores pointers and bounded digests.

**Why not a custom binary format.** The instinct toward "binary or other clever
databases" is right about the workload but wrong about the layer. The workload
is: one elected mutation loop, many concurrent readers (attached terminals, the
TUI, sub-agents querying history), atomic compare-and-swap claims, and
queries shaped like "ready leaves under this subtree", "everything this session
spawned", "folds from this workspace". That is exactly a WAL-mode SQLite
profile — concurrent readers never block the writer, transactions give CAS
claims for free, and the graph becomes *queryable*, which a hand-rolled binary
file never is. SQLite comfortably holds 10⁶–10⁷ rows on a laptop; we are years
from that. The clever-binary energy goes where it pays: the **CAS blob store**,
which is git's trick (packfile-style content addressing for bulk bytes, small
index for structure). If event volume ever outgrows SQLite, the migration is
mechanical, because of Decision 2.

**Why not in-memory like plandb v1.** plandb v1 (codeaf-v1) got the concurrency
semantics right — streaming admission, monotonic claim tokens, write scopes,
bounded digests — and this design keeps all of them. What it lacked was
durability: a process death lost the run (we lost a 19-minute benchmark run to
exactly this). The plandb API survives; its backing store becomes SQL.

## Decision 2 — Events are the truth; the graph is a view

**Decision.** The primitive is an append-only `events` table: `(seq, ts,
node_id, kind, payload)` — node spliced, claimed, turn completed, artifact
written, tokens spent, node settled, subtree folded, trigger fired. The
`nodes`/`edges` tables are a materialized view the resident keeps current in the
same transaction. Any state can be rebuilt by replaying events; resume after a
crash is "load view, continue", not "start over".

**Why.** Three problems collapse into one solution. *Resumability*: the silent
mid-run death costs nothing when every completed node's result is already
journaled. *History*: "what did the agent do last Tuesday and why" is a range
scan, not forensics over log files. *Attribution*: token/cost accounting is
read off events instead of inferred. The flight-recorder traces we bolted on
per-node become one event kind among many.

## Decision 3 — One spine, forever; goals splice, subtrees fold

**Decision.** The graph has a single permanent root. Every unit of work —
a user goal, a trigger firing, a task the agent sets for itself — splices a
subtree under it, stamped with provenance:

- `origin`: `user | trigger | self`
- `session_id`: which attachment asked (null for trigger/self)
- `intent`: the user's **verbatim words**, preserved unedited forever
- the grounding output: settled scope, open questions, evidence standard

When a subtree completes, it **folds**: one LLM call (the only place an LLM
call belongs in compaction — O(subtrees), not O(turns)) writes a bounded
digest of what was learned and produced, with pointers into the CAS and the
workspace. The fold node replaces the subtree in the *active* view; the full
subtree stays in the events table. The graph you look at is always small; the
graph on disk is the agent's whole life.

**Why verbatim intent.** Every pass we have (ground, fan-out, bind, brief)
interprets the goal, and interpretation drifts. The one thing that must never
be lost to compaction is what the user actually said. It is also the key for
memory recall (Decision 6).

## Decision 4 — One resident role per database; everything else attaches

**Decision.** The resident is a role, not an owning daemon. A process becomes
resident by taking a non-blocking OS lock on `resident.lock` beside the
database. The lock carries diagnostic identity only; SQLite events and views
remain authoritative, and the kernel releases the role on process exit.

An elected chat runs the head, reconciler, and workers. Other chat processes
stay surface-only: they tail the WAL-backed thread and append user messages or
command requests to its journal. `codeaf wake` first probes the lease and
starts a bounded full reconciliation pass only when the role is free.

**Why a role instead of a daemon.** The file is independently readable and
writable under WAL, command requests are already durable mailboxes, and claim
tokens already make worker ownership a compare-and-swap. Electing the mutation
loop preserves one active scheduler per database without making availability
depend on a privileged process or a second control plane.

**Why a single scheduler thread is not the bottleneck.** Concurrency lives in
the leaves (each leaf is its own goroutine running its own model loop) and in
readers (WAL). The scheduler is a cheap event loop deciding readiness — plandb
v1 already proved this shape at `-j 6`. What was actually missing was not more
orchestrator threads but orchestrator *statelessness*: the resident holder may
die, restart, and pick up mid-graph from the store. Multi-writer
distribution (several hosts, one graph) is explicitly out of scope; if it ever
matters, the sharding unit is the workspace, and the event log makes
replication tractable. Do not build it now.

**Concurrency semantics carried over from plandb v1, verbatim in spirit:**
atomic pending→claimed CAS with a monotonic claim token (in SQL: `UPDATE …
WHERE status='pending' AND claim_token=?`), so a stale worker can never settle
a reassigned node; streaming admission so the first leaf starts before the
last is planned; write scopes so two leaves never mutate the same material
concurrently (the STATE edges the bind pass now emits map directly onto this);
failure is local — a failed dependency hands its digest downstream instead of
stranding the subtree.

## Decision 5 — Triggers are nodes the agent can plant

**Decision.** A trigger is a first-class node (`kind: trigger`) owned by the
resident trigger engine, carrying:

- a **condition**: `cron:` schedule | `file:` fsnotify glob | `webhook:` path
  \+ shared secret | `graph:` predicate (node settled/failed, spend threshold)
- a **splice template**: the goal text and workspace to instantiate when it
  fires (the template is re-grounded at fire time — the world may have moved)
- **rails**: a per-firing token budget, a firing-rate limit, and an expiry.
  A trigger without rails is invalid by construction.

Triggers are planted three ways: by the user (`codeaf watch …`, `codeaf cron
…`), by the planner (a graph can end in a trigger — "re-verify nightly"), and
by an executor tool (`plant_trigger`), which is the self-directed case: an
agent finishing a task can leave behind "re-run the suite when this file
changes". Firing is an event like any other, so trigger-spawned subtrees have
full provenance (`origin: trigger`, pointing at the planter).

**Why rails are non-negotiable.** A self-planting, self-firing agent is the
point of the design and also its main hazard. Every firing spends from a
budget fixed at plant time; the daemon additionally enforces a global
spend-per-day rail across all origins. Runaway is bounded by construction, not
by hoping the model behaves.

## Decision 6 — Memory is the folded graph, recalled at ground time

**Decision.** There is no separate memory system. Folds (Decision 3) *are* the
long-term memory: bounded digests with verbatim-intent keys, workspace keys,
and artifact pointers. The ground pass gains one step: query the store for
prior folds matching the new goal's workspace and intent (FTS5 keyword match
first; embeddings only if that proves insufficient), and inject the top few
digests as recall — "you have worked here before; here is what was learned,
and where the details live." The executor gains the complementary pull tool:
any leaf can query folds and read the pointed-at material from the CAS.

This subsumes the in-run knowledge index: a folded node's digest serves
siblings during the run and posterity after it — one mechanism, two ranges.
The capability profiles from the calibration plan live in the same store, keyed
by model and skill: capability memory and knowledge memory, same shelf.

## Decision 7 — The conversation is a lens on the brain, not the brain

**Decision.** There is one brain. A surface attaches to it and removes or adds
nothing but the person. `codeaf chat` is that brain with a head and a terminal;
`codeaf do` is the same construction with the conversation removed, and the
seam between them is exactly one thing: where the task comes from.

A chat ask travels through the head, which resolves what it points back into
before it becomes a command. A headless task is **verbatim** — there is no
conversation for it to point into, so it is referentially closed by definition
and goes straight into the journal the head would have written to. From that
command onward nothing downstream can tell which surface produced it, because
it is literally the same code.

**Why this and not a separate headless engine.** The alternative already exists
and is instructive: `plan`/`run` compiles a graph to a file and executes what
the file says. Everything this system learned about doing jobs happens *after*
the plan is written — the contract for the kind of work in front of it, the
gate that asks whether the person would accept this, the round a cited gap
earns, the replan when a leaf runs out of room. A frozen graph cannot do any of
it, so a second engine would either be a worse brain or a duplicate of this
one. Keeping `plan`/`run` for reading and hand-editing plans, and making `do` a
lens rather than an engine, is what stops the two from drifting.

**What the lens must still answer for.** With nobody watching, the process
itself has to say what a person would have seen: an exit code that separates
*failed* from *hit the wall* from *never attempted*, a question surfaced as
`blocked_on` rather than smuggled into the deliverable, and a periodic
structural read on stderr so silence is diagnosable. Those are contracts, not
conveniences — [HEADLESS.md](HEADLESS.md) is where they are written down and
what every harness is programmed against.

## Decision 8 — One boundary reads what a bad response meant

**Decision.** Three things used to arrive at the harness looking the same, and
every site answered for itself: the **transport** (nobody answered, or somebody
answered with something that was not an answer), the **capability** of the model
(a check read the finished work and named gaps), and the **work** (the job could
not be done, or the request itself is what is refused). `internal/taxonomy` is
the one place that tells them apart. `Classify(evidence, limits)` reads a small
evidence struct into one of the three classes and returns the single policy
registered for that class.

**The three policies.** *Transport* retries on the same tier with the endpoint
rotated underneath, N attempts doubling off one backoff — with **no** wait for an
empty 200 or a mangled tool call, which are instant failures from a healthy
endpoint that waiting does not mend. It never ends a turn and it never counts
toward a lift. *Capability* buys **one** tier after K findings on the same tier
with the wire ruled out, under a per-work cost cap, and hands the tier back the
moment a check passes. *Work* takes no action and is returned to the caller with
the evidence on it — which is where the landing machinery picks it up.

**Why.** Nothing about who *served* a request is evidence about who was *asked*.
On a five-run comparison the three runs that happened to roll four consecutive
malformed refusals read them as the model being unable, bought a model seven
times the price for the rest of the run and never came back down — 57–82% of
bills of $9.50–15.80, against $2.33 for the run that never rolled four.

**The knobs** are `internal/config`'s `ResponseLimitsAt`: `response.attempts`
(a MULTIPLIER on how long a call may go on trying — `lane.Role.GiveUp`, 90s for
a turn — default 1, and never a number of sends since #864),
`response.lift_after` (K, default 1 — the count was never what was wrong),
`response.lift_cap_usd` (default $25 on a lifted tier per piece of work — see
[LIMITS.md](LIMITS.md); 0 is no cap), each with a `CODEAF_RESPONSE_*` pin. They
are values in one struct, not constants at the sites that need them.

**Where it is wired.** `internal/session/taxonomy_boundary.go` is the adapter and
the only file in that package allowed to call `Classify` or to buy a dearer
model. It is asked at the turn loop's retry ladder, at the turn loop's empty 200
(which no longer ends the turn), at the errand ladder's deadline, at the node's
model move after a run ends on a provider failure, and at the repair gate. Each
classification writes one journal line, `type: "failure"`, carrying the class,
the reason, the action and whatever evidence was there — so a bench counts the
ratio of transport to capability rather than reconstructing it.

**Why a registry and not a switch.** A switch on the class at each site is three
answers that start the same and drift the first time one is fixed. Two structural
tests hold the line (`internal/session/taxonomy_law_test.go`): `Classify` may be
called only from the boundary file, and so may the two functions that put work on
a dearer model. A new escalation trigger added anywhere else fails the build with
its line number.

## Decision 9 — Every session has a principal; unattended sessions get a Steward

**Decision.** One interface, `session.Principal`, is the addressee of every road
in the engine that ends in "ask the person": `Ask`, `Acceptance`, `Budget`,
`Report(landing)` and `Decide(remains) → {carry on with a brief | done | stop
with a reason}`. Two implementations. `Person` is the attended session and
**adds nothing** — it holds no acceptance, has no budget, turns no landing into
work, and decides exactly what `readRemains`'s empty string already decided.
`Steward` is the unattended one: `chat --yolo` **with a budget**.

**Why.** Autonomous runs were ending with most of their budget unspent, holding
partial work. The cause was not a bug in any function: it was a correct sentence
addressed to somebody who was not there. A landing that ran out of repair rounds
tells the model to "offer them a follow-up in their own words"; with no them,
the model answers in words, the turn ends, and the session idles. Nothing
anywhere held the whole ask, and nothing ever looked at the tree or at what the
session had left lying beside it.

**A budget is what arms it, and nothing else.** `--yolo` says one thing today —
run tools without asking — and reading it as permission to spend hours carrying
work on would be the harness acting on a sentence nobody wrote. `--max-hours`
and `--max-cost` (env `CODEAF_MAX_HOURS` / `CODEAF_MAX_COST`, either alone is a
budget) are that sentence. Without one, `--yolo` is exactly what it was and the
door prints one line saying what the other thing is called.

**What routes through it.**

| road | before | with a Steward |
|---|---|---|
| a stopped turn (`checkpointReopen`) | the mark reader's line, or the turn ends | the same line, plus the session acceptance, how the units of work landed, and — only when a principal says the ask is met — the declared checks re-run from clean |
| a landing that ran out of repair rounds (`taskNote`) | "offer them a follow-up" | `Report` turns the audit's own account of the gap into the next brief, in the same working copy |
| a landing nobody could judge (`settlePolicy`) | waits on a card | settles itself, as a headless run already did |
| the post-turn work judge (`routeJudge`) | skips every woken turn | a woken turn is judged against the session's frozen ask — the only kind of turn an unattended run has after its first |
| a standing item (`askStanding`) | "nobody is here to say yes" | the goal owner answers its own card, within the rails `Item.Validate` already demands |

**Session acceptance.** At the start of the first turn the judge's own machinery
(`routeVerdictContract`, `routeAcceptance`) writes one `done when` sentence for
the **whole** ask, journaled and frozen for the session — a done-condition the
work can rewrite is one the work grades itself against. Every acceptance before
this was one unit of work's, read only by that unit's auditor.

**The terminal audit.** Before a Steward may say done: re-run the explicit
verification contracts held by the current tasks (`sessionChecks` uses each
node's `auditDoorFor`), each in a fresh process in the deliverable tree. Commands
in prose and worker receipts do not grant permission to run them again. A
revision revokes the previous goal's contract. Then reconcile everything the
session created. A created path inside the deliverable tree is part of the
answer; outside it, it is scratch, and scratch is removed and written down.
Nothing the session did not create is ever touched — the created bit is measured
before the call that writes the file and journaled, so it survives a resume — and
a `Person`'s session deletes nothing at all, it is offered the list.

**Rails.** The budget stops the run with a report rather than with silence. The
same failure signature three times stops it for good; the signature is the
audit's own first line today and is the field a proper failure classification
drops into unchanged. "Done" requires the acceptance to hold from clean, and a
session that has finished no unit of work is never done whatever its transcript
says.

**Why an interface rather than flags on the agent.** The two answers are a
policy, not a branch: a third principal — a person on another machine, a queue,
a scheduled owner — has to be writable without any road in the engine learning a
new name. Two structural tests hold the line: one fails when a new road onto the
wake queue appears without saying who it is addressed to, and one fails when a
person-addressed sentence is written anywhere that has never heard of a
principal.
## Decision 10 — Lanes: the model id is an address, the lane is the machine

**Decision.** What this build believes about the endpoints behind a model lives
in one provider-agnostic package, `internal/lane`. It holds a belief per
`(model, lane)`, it is asked for a preference before every send, and it watches
every stream that results. It has no transport and no surface: it never opens a
connection, never reads a clock of its own, and never formats a number for a
person.

**Why a package and not more of `velocity.go`.** One model id is served by a
dozen endpoints that differ by 7× on the wait before the first token and by 12×
on how fast they write, at roughly the same price — and by capability too, so
the fastest of them may be the one that drops the tool call. The velocity ledger
answered that with a strike table: two slow answers demote, three refuse for
five minutes, and slow means a fixed two seconds. That is reactive, blind on the
first call of every process, forgotten at exit, unable to rescue a request that
is already slow, and invisible in the picker. Every one of those five is a
consequence of having a *table* where a *belief* belongs. `docs/design/routing/provider-routing.md`
is the full design and the measurements it was drawn from.

### The boundary

Three layers, and the arrows only point one way.

| layer | knows about | never knows about |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `internal/lane` | rows, sightings, beliefs, requests, choices | HTTP, SSE, the router's dialect, a surface |
| `internal/provider` | how to turn a `lane.Choice` into `provider.order` / `only` / `ignore`, and a stream into a `lane.Sighting` | how a belief is computed |
| `internal/tui3` | how to draw a belief the registry handed it | how a belief is computed, and how one is sent |

`lane.Default()` is the registry where the concrete sheet, ledger, chooser,
prober and store are wired together, and it is the only place any of them is
constructed. Every other caller asks the registry for an interface — the same
reason the response boundary (Decision 8) is a registry and not a switch: sites
that each decide for themselves start the same and drift the first time one of
them is fixed.

### The data flow

Four paths, each of which crosses the boundary exactly once.

```
sheet    →  Ledger.Prime(row, k)      →  a prior, so nothing is blind on the first call
stream   →  Ledger.Note(sighting)     →  the belief this process measured itself
request  →  Chooser.Choose(request)   →  provider.order / only / ignore on the wire
stream   →  Watch.Token / Silence     →  a verdict, and at most one hedge
```

### The laws

- **No fetch on the send path.** `Sheet.Rows` reads memory and may be called
  from anywhere; `Sheet.Refresh` goes to the network and belongs to a background
  beat. A missing sheet means "no prior, use the belief alone" and never "wait
  while I look". `internal/provider/lane_law_test.go` fails the build when any
  non-test file in the transport so much as names `Refresh`.
- **Every number a person sees is the posterior.** The sheet is a thirty-minute
  aggregate over everybody's prompts; our own sightings are about our prompts
  from our region. Both are evidence, neither is truth, and what a picker draws
  is the belief that combined them.
- **Quality is a gate and never a weight.** A lane that drops tool calls,
  truncates, or returns JSON the decoder refuses leaves the candidate set until
  its Beta recovers. Weighing quality against price is how a router learns to
  ship wrong answers cheaply.
- **A hedge is a measurement.** The second request a slow stream earns is also
  the only cheap way to learn what the alternative lane would have done, so it
  is fed back as a sighting whichever way it lands — and it is budgeted, because
  an un-budgeted hedge is the one failure mode here that costs real money.
- **No fixed thresholds.** The four constants the strike ledger ran on retire
  with it. Slow means "surprising for this lane, ten minutes ago", which is the
  innovation the filter already computes. Forgetting is losing confidence, never
  changing the estimate, so there is no penalty box and no cooldown timer: a
  belief widens until the sheet or a sampled draw puts the lane back in the
  running — and it widens far enough that a fresh public reading really can
  outweigh it, which is a number the first build got wrong by exactly the factor
  it discounts the sheet by.
- **An order of one is not a ranking.** A ledger that has heard of a single lane
  has nothing to rank, and the one name it holds is the endpoint that happened to
  serve rather than the endpoint that should. It says nothing, and the transport
  sends what it sent before this package existed. The same law reads the other
  way at the gate: a lane nobody has judged is refused on the upper bound of its
  quality belief and never on its mean, or the first request of every process
  refuses every lane for want of evidence and then never sends the request that
  would have supplied it.
- **The choice is pure.** `lane.Request` carries its own `Now`. A structural
  test fails the build when a choosing file names `time.Now`.

### The file map, and who owns which file

Wave 0 landed the contract and the instrument. The five wave-1 lanes each own a
disjoint set of files, so no two of them edit the same one.

| lane | owns | delivers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| — (wave 0) | `internal/lane/{lane,posterior,contract,registry}.go`, `internal/lane/lanestub/` | the types, the five interfaces, the registry, the fake router |
| L-A | `internal/lane/sheet*.go`, `belief*.go`, `store*.go` | the endpoints client and its beat, the Kalman ledger, `~/.codeaf/v3/lanes.json` |
| L-B | `internal/lane/choose*.go`, `frontier*.go`, `value*.go`; `internal/provider/lanes.go`; λ plumbing in `internal/session` | the gate, the Pareto prune, the scalar, and the adapter that replaces the velocity ledger's order and ignore |
| L-C | `internal/lane/watch*.go`, `hedge*.go`, `probe*.go`; `internal/provider/hedge.go`, `probe.go`; the stream loop in `internal/provider/client.go` | the derived deadline, the heartbeat and drift tests, the budgeted hedge, the probe on typing |
| L-D | `internal/tui3/lanes*.go` and the picker, settings and HUD edits; the lane keys in `internal/config`; the manual pages | the speed column, the lane unfold, the filter grammar, the settings rows |
| L-E | the new fields in `internal/session/usage_ledger.go` and `internal/calllog`; `bench/lanelab/`; `internal/lane/e2e_test.go` | the ledger fields, the simulator and the live A/B, and the real-key proof under `-tags e2e` |

Two practical notes for the lanes. `internal/provider` already has an unexported
type called `lane` (`velocity.go`), so the adapter file imports this package
under a name — the collision is real and the compiler will not warn about the
shadowing, it will simply resolve to the wrong one. And the transport only sends
a routing preference to something it believes is a router, from the base URL or
the configured model, so a test that wants to see `provider.order` on the wire
against `lanestub` configures its client with a model spelled `openrouter/…`.

### The four seams wave 2b joined

The five lanes each left a socket. Wave 2b is where they were plugged in, and
four of the joins are worth stating because each one is a place two layers had
to agree without either importing the other.

| what | where it lives | how it crosses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| the person's row | `internal/provider/lanepin.go` | the surface RESOLVES `lane.<slot>` and `lane.guard` and WRITES the answer to a process-wide knob (`SetLanePin`, `SetLaneGuard`). It is a write and not a read because the transport may not touch a settings file on the send path, and it is not a `Config` field because the picker rewrites the row while the process runs. |
| the lane news | `internal/session/lanenews.go` | `internal/tui3` imports `internal/session`, so the arrow only points one way: the surface REGISTERS a reader at open (`session.OnLaneNews`) and the turn loop pushes to it. Two posts for a rescued answer — `Trying` while the second request is out, `Hedged`+`Winner` at the end — and one for every other. |
| the keystroke | `Agent.Typing` → `Client.ProbeLanes` | an OPTIONAL interface on both sides, the shape `modelChain` already uses: a door that cannot probe simply never does. The debounce is the prober's own, so the composer has no first-keystroke state to keep and cannot get it wrong. |
| the talk request's shape | `provider.LaneTalkAsk` | the picker's `auto` row must predict the lane the next turn will really use, so it asks the chooser with the request the transport will build rather than one of its own. A surface that wrote its own left λ at zero and named the CHEAPEST lane — a correct answer to a question a conversation never asks. |

And one law learned by breaking it: **a number a row draws and the name it draws
beside it must come from the same lane.** The model row drew the speed of
whichever lane the surface's own sort put first and then wrote the chooser's
name after it, which was invisible while the chooser had no opinion and became a
row attributing one machine's measurement to another the day it landed.

### The instrument

`internal/lane/lanestub` is a fake router with lanes of a scripted speed, and it
is shared by all five lanes for the reason a shared fixture usually is not: five
private routers would differ, and the first disagreement between them would look
like a bug in the code under test. It serves the endpoints sheet in the router's
own field names, a minimal catalog, and a streamed completion that honours
`provider.order` / `only` / `ignore`, emits the router's heartbeat comments,
names the serving lane on every chunk, ends with a usage frame carrying the
exact cost, and counts the streams a client walked away from. On its fast clock
a scenario scripted in minutes finishes in microseconds.

### The waiting policy

**Decision.** *When* to act on a silence is decided by ONE controller, for every
token-generating call, in every phase. `internal/lane/control` holds it: pure
functions over a moment and a belief, no clock, no connection, no surface. The
design is `docs/design/waiting/DESIGN.md`; this is the shape of it.

**Why one and not three.** A request is silent for one of three reasons —
nothing has arrived, the endpoint is writing a run of thought nobody can read,
or visible text was arriving and stopped — and until this wave those were three
rule sets with three sets of constants. Three rule sets is three places to be
wrong, and the reported defect was in the gap between two of them: a stream that
stalled inside its thinking was governed by none, and the first thing that acted
on three minutes of silence was a transport bound.

They are one question. Given a distribution over the time to the next VISIBLE
progress and a silence of `s`, the expected remaining wait `W(s) = E[T − s | T > s]`
RISES for a heavy-tailed lane. Act when it exceeds what acting costs — the
alternative's own wait, plus regenerating the visible text already delivered, plus
the money through λ, plus a hysteresis margin. The phase only chooses which
distribution `W` is taken over.

**The laws.**

- **Routing and waiting are two questions and never share one nil.**
  `lane.Choice` answers which lane; `control.Plan` answers when to act. A call
  the chooser had no opinion about still has a plan, a ceiling and a voice. This
  is the root cause of the three-minute turn, stated so it cannot come back.
- **Every role has a ceiling, and no role decides whether there is one.** Ten
  seconds for a role a person is reading (`lane.VisiblePatience`), scaled by the
  role's own `Patience`. It bounds time-to-action whatever the belief says.
- **A wait with nowhere to go is REPORTED, never sat through in silence.** When
  every reachable lane is believed slow the act is the HUD saying so.
- **A pinned lane is asked, never overridden.** The offer rides the phase channel
  as `PhaseAsking`; a visible token withdraws it; a headless run with no reader
  borrows at the ceiling and says so in the log.
- **A heartbeat proves the path and never the endpoint**, so it never resets the
  silence clock. A thinking delta keeps the stream alive, moves the phase, and
  is not progress.
- **Beliefs are hierarchical.** `ln T = μ + a[lane] + b[model] + e[model, lane]`,
  each level with its own half-life. A pair nobody has measured predicts from
  the provider and the model, which is why cold start needs no special case.

### Every clock on a request

One outbound request is watched by eighteen independent timers, owned by six
files, and until they were written down in one place nobody could say which of
them would fire first. Nineteen, until this wave: `internal/session/loop.go`
kept a second hedge of its own — a flat eight seconds without a first token, a
duplicate of the whole prompt into the same pool, no lane named, no budget asked
and no measurement taken from either arm — and it is RETIRED, because two
mechanisms answering one silence is the prompt paid for twice to be told about
it once. Everything it did, row 1 does better; the one thing it did that row 1
cannot is fire with `routing off`, and answering "do not steer" by silently
sending the request again is the loudest possible steer. That is not a filing problem. The measured defect the
phase clock was built for is exactly what happens when the order is wrong: a
stream that stalled sixty seconds into a reasoning pass could not hedge — the
commitment rule was counting hidden tokens — so the first thing that acted on it
was the stall guard, two and a half minutes away, and the surface said "still
working" for the whole of it.

The rank column is who acts first, and it is the design. Rows 1–6 are the cheap
answers: a second request, or a wait. Rows 7–9 are asked in passing and cost no
wall clock of their own. Rows 10–18 are the last resorts, and every one of them
throws away work that was already paid for.

| rank | clock | owner | trigger | what it does | the bound |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | the controller, before the first token | `internal/lane/control` | `W(s)` over the serving lane's first-token belief exceeds what acting costs | one more arm, or an offer on a pin, or a report when there is nowhere to go | derived per request; never under `ActionFloor` **700ms**, never over the role's ceiling |
| 2 | the controller, inside a run of thought | `internal/lane/control` | the whole thinking phase has outrun this `(model, rung)`'s learned duration, OR the gap between two thinking deltas has outrun the lane's believed rate | the same acts. A legitimately long think is not hedged; a stalled think is | the same two bounds |
| 3 | the controller, mid-stream | `internal/lane/control` | `W(s)` over the gap between two VISIBLE tokens exceeds acting, and leaving beats finishing | the same acts | the same two bounds. Commitment is the same inequality with the tokens already written on the other side |
| 4 | the ceiling | `internal/lane/roles.go` | the silence reaches the role's own patience, whatever is believed | something is done: hedge, ask, or report | `VisiblePatience` **10s** × the role's `Patience` (×0.5 probe … ×6 standing, judge, design) |
| 5 | the dead path | `internal/lane/watch.go`, `internal/provider/armwatch.go` | an act fired and NOTHING has reached this stream — no token, no comment | names the act `no heartbeat` and flags it, so no belief is charged for somebody's wifi | `lane.DeadPathFloor` **3s** of silence before the claim may be made at all: a handshake on a cold path can honestly outlast a fast lane's whole believed wait |
| 6 | the purse | `internal/lane/hedge.go`, `internal/lane/watch.go` | asked before the controller decides AND before the arm sends, with one price | allows or refuses the arm; a refusal turns the act into a report and the row says `plan cannot pay` | THE CALL'S OWN BUDGET: `control.Plan.SpendUSD` = `Role.GiveUp()` × what a second of this role's wait is worth (`λ / AttentionValue`, over `AttentionValue` **90** s/$) — $1.00 for `talk`, $0.75 for `leaf.unattended`; `maxArms` **4** for one question, and it is the only thing that counts arms |
| 7 | the pacing wait | `internal/provider/retry.go` | a 429 | waits and re-sends; the phase clock says `paced` with the router's own `Retry-After` as a real countdown | `baseBackoff` **700ms** doubled and jittered, one wait never over `maxProviderWait` **1 min**; the call ends at `rateLimitAttempts` **6** / `watchedPacingBudget` **2 min** watched, `patientAttempts` **60** / `patientPacingBudget` **10 min** unwatched |
| 8 | the relax ladder | `internal/provider/endpoints.go` | a refusal about the request's SHAPE (400/404/unsupported parameter) | re-asks at once with one field dropped | **6 rungs**, then `maxFallbackModels` **2** other models — and **NO WAIT BETWEEN RUNGS**, because nothing here is backing off from a fault |
| 9 | admission | `internal/provider/limiter.go` | more than `limiterCeiling` **64** requests in flight | queues, and hands the next freed slot to the waiter | **no timer at all.** `sharedLimiter.acquire` selects on the queue and the caller's context and nothing else; a request held here is held by the caller's own deadline |
| 10 | the first-delta bound | `internal/provider/streamguard.go` | the model has written nothing — no answer token, no reasoning token, no tool-call fragment | cuts the request, `CutSilent` | `firstDeltaBound` **90s** × the role's `Patience` |
| 11 | the mid-stream gap | `internal/provider/streamguard.go` | an established stream goes quiet | cuts the request, `CutStalled` | `midStreamGapBound` **45s** × the role's `Patience` — half the first bound, because a model that has started writing has finished deciding — and `gapFor`'s own narrowing onto the lane's measured rate is clamped by the same floor |
| 12 | the buffered quiet | `internal/provider/streamguard.go` | quiet, but the endpoint is still sending keepalives | cuts the request | `bufferedQuietBound` **150s** × the role's `Patience` of quiet in total; keepalives buy patience and the patience is bounded |
| 13 | the wall | `internal/provider/streamguard.go` | a reply that keeps writing and never ends | cuts the request, `CutOverrun` | `streamWallFactor` **5 ×** the longest reply THIS LANE has completed, clamped to `streamWallFloor` **5 min** … `streamWallCeiling` **20 min**. It bounds a stream that is PRODUCING, so no role scales it: the controller has nothing to say about a reply that is arriving |
| 14 | the cut budget | `internal/session/loop.go` | a cut came back | asks again, and when the budget is spent hops the model | `silentRetries` **2**, `babbleRetries` **1**, `blindRetries` **1** — then `FallbackModels`, and the hop is SAID |
| 15 | the response header deadline | `internal/provider/transport.go` | the endpoint accepted the connection and never wrote a header | the transport fails the attempt | `responseHeaderTimeout` **2 min**, on the streaming transport only — a non-streamed completion writes no header until the whole answer exists |
| 16 | the body idle watchdog | `internal/provider/transport.go` | no BYTE at all on the wire, keepalives included | cancels the request context, which is the only thing that unblocks a parked `Read` | `streamIdleTimeout` **2 min** |
| 17 | the completion total deadline | `internal/provider/client.go` | a non-streamed call | `http.Client.Timeout` | `adaptiveCompletionTimeout`: floor **5 min** (or `Config.Timeout` when larger), **1s per 64 requested tokens**, ceiling **15 min** — and held under the lane's own measured wall once there is one. For a stream `client.Timeout` is **0** on purpose: a total deadline killed every healthy long stream at the budget |
| 18 | the structuring wall | `internal/provider/pool/wall.go` | one structuring completion — the slot that talks, the slot that plans | `ErrCallWall`, wrapping `context.DeadlineExceeded` | `DefaultCallWall` **4 min**, per completion and never per command |
| — | dial and TLS | Go's `http.DefaultTransport` | — | — | the standard library's own defaults. **They are named nowhere in this build** — no constant, no config row — and the header deadline above is what actually catches a host that accepts and never answers |

**Rows 10–12 are scaled by the role, and every one of them clears that role's
ceiling by `transportHeadroom` = 2.** The ordering above is a claim and it was
false until this wave: a mid-stream bound derived at 15s pre-empted the 30s and
60s ceilings of every unattended role, so the last resort was firing before the
cheap act it exists to sit behind. Two ceilings of headroom rather than one
because acting is not finishing — at the ceiling the controller puts a second
request on the wire, and that request has its own handshake and first token to
pay before it rescues anything. `internal/provider/streamguard_ceiling_test.go`
walks every role in `lane.Roles()` at every rate `gapFor` can be handed and
fails the build if any bound falls to or below a ceiling.

**ROWS 1–6 WERE REWRITTEN BY THE WAITING POLICY** (`docs/design/waiting/DESIGN.md`).
What they replace, and why each is retired:

| retired | was | why it is gone |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Choice.Deadline` / `Choice.Alt` | the clock rode inside the routing answer | a cold ledger returned neither, so the case that most needed a deadline got none |
| `deadlineCeiling` **8s** | the top of a derived deadline | replaced by the role's ceiling, which exists whether or not a belief does |
| `lumpGap` **15s** | one gap long enough to complain about | replaced by the gap distribution: the same complaint about a slow lane, a different one about a fast lane |
| `commitTokens` **64 visible** | where an answer stopped being cheap to abandon | replaced by the same inequality with the tokens already written on the other side — right for a 400-token reply and wrong for a 4,000-token one |
| `driftSlack` / `driftAlarm` | a CUSUM over inter-token gaps | the CUSUM moves up a level: it now watches the belief for a CHANGE POINT, and the gap is judged by `W(s)` like every other silence |
| one hedge per request | `Watch.Hedged()` | a request may earn more than one arm; the purse bounds it, not a boolean |
| `hedgeTime` / `hedgeFloor` / `hedgeCeiling` / `hedgeOverhead` | `choose.go`'s own log-normal crossing, clamped to a fixed band | the same arithmetic, said once, in `control.Survival.Remaining` — and asked of every call rather than of the calls the chooser happened to have an opinion about |
| the wire's ceiling rewrite | `hedge.go` turned a report raised at the ceiling into a hedge | the controller decides and the wire obeys: a verdict rewritten downstream is a row that says "report" about a request it put on the wire |

**THE WATCH DECIDES FIRST AND THE STALL GUARD IS A LAST RESORT.** The watch's
answer costs one extra request and keeps the person's answer moving; the guard's
answer throws away the whole attempt, the prompt it was paid for and any text
that was already on the screen. So the guard exists for the case where no hedge
is possible at all — no alternative lane in the choice, `routing off`, the
speed guard off, or a budget that refused — and its bounds are deliberately far
past every one of the watch's. And **every transport timeout is a CEILING above
the guard's bounds, never the first thing to fire**: 90s of silence is cut by
the guard before either two-minute transport clock has anything to say, which is
why a stall is named in a person's words rather than surfacing as a torn
connection.

#### A dropped connection is the path's fault, and one owner answers it

A stream that resets mid-body — `connection reset by peer`, `broken pipe`,
`unexpected EOF` — is a claim about the WIRE and about nothing else. Three
layers can see it and each of them can re-ask: the funnel (the watch reads a
path with no heartbeat and no byte as a fault, hedges, and does not charge the
lane's belief for it); this package's own transport ladder (`retryablePattern`
in `internal/session/loop.go`, 2s/4s/8s, four attempts); and, above both, a task
node that could run a whole second worker on the same model in the same working
copy. THREE ANSWERS TO ONE DROPPED SOCKET IS THE PROMPT PAID FOR THREE TIMES,
and the person is told about it once.

So the ownership is the same as everywhere else in this table: **the funnel
re-asks, and every layer above it only chooses its WORDS.**
`provider.PathFault(err)` is the seam — a predicate and deliberately not a
policy, documented at `internal/provider/streamguard.go` — so a node whose run
ended on a dropped connection can say `lost the connection` instead of `failed`
without starting a fourth clock to earn the right to. A layer that wants to
re-ask anyway has one honest precondition: the funnel could not have rescued it
(no alternative lane, `routing off`, or a budget that refused), and that is a
question `HedgeReport` already answers.

### The ladder

Four rungs, and they are climbed in this order for one reason: each one changes
more of what the person asked for than the one before it. Rung 1 changes which
machine answers. Rung 2 changes which machine answers and is not even our
decision. Rung 3 changes the SHAPE of the question. Rung 4 changes who answers
it, which is a different answer.

| rung | what changes | who walks it | when | bound |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | same model, the one lane we chose | **us** — `internal/lane/control`, `internal/provider/hedge.go` | the controller: the expected remaining wait exceeds what acting costs, or the role's ceiling is reached | arms to the frontier's next lane, bounded by the purse rather than by a count; losers are cancelled and every arm is folded back into the ledger. A pinned lane is ASKED instead |
| 2 | same model, every other lane that passed the gate | **the router**, inside the request; **us** when a rescue itself fails | the router walks continuously on its own; we walk when an arm comes back refused or broken | on the wire as `provider.order` in frontier order with `allow_fallbacks` true; ours is `hedgeRace.walk`, capped at `maxArms` **4** and budgeted |
| 3 | same model, a smaller question | **us** — `internal/provider/endpoints.go` | a refusal about the request's shape | `require_parameters` → `reasoning` → `max_tokens` → `response_format` → images → tools |
| 4 | **another model** | **us** — `internal/provider/endpoints.go`, and `internal/session/loop.go` for a stall | every rung above is exhausted, or the cut budget is spent | the operator's `Fallbacks`, else `NearestModels`; `maxFallbackModels` **2** |

**Rung 2 is mostly the router's walk.** While the request is in flight we do not
iterate it, time it or report on it: we hand over a ranked order and a
permission, and the endpoints behind it are walked inside the one request whose
first word we are waiting for. There is no timer for that half and a reader who
goes looking for one will not find it.

**The half that IS ours starts where a rescue fails.** A hedge is pinned — it
sends `only` with no fallbacks, which is what stops the second request landing
back on the machine that is already stalling — so a rescue that comes back
refused or broken has nowhere of its own to go, and the primary may still be
silent. `hedgeRace.walk` takes the next untried gate-passing lane off the
frontier and asks it, up to `maxArms` **4** requests for one question, every one
of them through the same budget. It is not a second hedge: a hedge is a bet
against SLOWNESS fired by the watch, and this is the answer to a lane that has
FAILED, so one refusal must not spend the one hedge a slow lane is still owed.

And it is why **`Client.sendRecovered` hands a refusal back untouched while a
lane is still untried**: relaxing the request there would take the tools off a
question that only needed a different endpoint, while an endpoint that would
have taken it whole sat unasked. Rung 3 runs on the LAST arm, where the evidence
really is about the request rather than about one machine.

**A REFUSAL CLIMBS THE RELAX LADDER. SLOWNESS NEVER DOES.** Rung 3 is only ever
reached by the refusal class — 400, 404, "no endpoints found that can handle the
requested parameters", "unsupported parameter" — because every rung of it is a
claim about the request's *shape*, and a slow lane has made no such claim.
Dropping `reasoning` or `tools` off a request because it was taking a while
would answer a different question from the one that was asked and call it a
retry. A timeout, a 5xx and a 429 keep the behaviour `retry.go` gives them.

**A ROLE'S MODEL TIERS ARE NOT A FALLBACK.** The reflex / low / high tiers a
role is served on are a decision about what a piece of work is worth, made
before the request goes out. A fallback is a decision about what else could
answer *this* question, and it is chosen by NEARNESS — the operator's list, else
`NearestModels` — never by dropping a tier. Falling from high to reflex because
an endpoint was slow would answer a person's question with a model nobody chose
for it, and it would look like the system working.

Rung 4 says so out loud: the phase clock posts `switching model` and names the
model in `Then`, because the rest of the reply arrives in a different voice at a
different price and somebody watching text appear is owed the reason before it
does.

**Why the rungs were out of order.** Until the commitment rule was taught to
count only VISIBLE tokens, a stall inside a reasoning pass could not hedge at
all: the run of thought had pushed the stream past `commitTokens`, so every
verdict was refused as "committed", and rung 1 never fired for the failure it
was written for. What fired instead was rank 10's silence bound, twice — and two
cuts spend the session's whole cut budget, so the step hopped the model. The
answer changed models while its own model's other lanes had never been tried.
That is the ladder walked from the bottom, and it cost a person's turn and a
dearer request to do it.

### The phase clock

**Decision.** The layer that holds the wire says what it is doing, in a person's
words, and the surface draws it. `internal/provider`'s `PhaseNews` is posted on
every change and about once a second while a phase lasts (`phaseBeat`);
`internal/session`'s `OnPhaseNews` forwards every one of them and adds the
phases a TURN has that a request does not; `internal/tui3`'s `PostPhaseNews`
keeps the latest per model and `phaseWords` is the only place one is spelled.

The arrow points one way the whole distance — `internal/tui3` imports
`internal/session`, which imports `internal/provider` — so a surface REGISTERS
and the layers below PUSH, exactly as the lane news does (Decision 10's seam
table). A build with nobody listening pays one atomic load per phase change.

| the vocabulary | what it means |
| --- | --- |
| `connecting` | the handshake — DNS, TLS, the request going out; nothing accepted yet |
| `first word` | accepted, and nothing written back: the queue, the router's own walk, a cold model. The one phase a hedge deadline belongs to |
| `thinking` | a run of reasoning tokens. The endpoint IS writing and none of it is on the screen |
| `writing` | the answer arriving |
| `paced` | a rate-limit wait, with the router's own `Retry-After` as its deadline |
| `trying again` | the relax ladder, with the rung as `Detail` — "2 of 6" |
| `switching` | a rescue in flight to another lane, nobody committed yet; `Then` names the lane |
| `switching model` | rung 4 — the only phase that changes what was asked; `Then` names the model |
| `running` / `checking` / `tidying` | a tool executing, a gate reading an answer, a compaction. They belong to `internal/session` and are spelled in `internal/provider` because there is ONE vocabulary |

**A DEADLINE IS NEVER INVENTED.** A countdown is drawn only where a real moment
exists at which this build really acts — the watch's own hedge deadline, or the
pacing wait the router asked for. `PhaseNews.Deadline` and `PhaseNews.Then` are
both zero unless both are real, and `phaseConsequence` draws the arrow only when
both halves are there. Where no alternative lane exists, or routing is off, the
phase and its count-up are still true and the consequence is simply absent. A
countdown that expires and does nothing is the surface lying about the
machinery, and the emptiness law already says what to draw instead of a figure
nobody measured, which is nothing.

**ONLY A VISIBLE ROLE OWNS THE CLOCK.** A conversation's turn makes several
calls that are nobody's business but the machine's — a title, a memory reflex, a
route question, a reply check — and each of them posts its own phases. A desk
that kept whichever answered last would put a naming errand's `writing · 61 t/s`
under an answer somebody was still waiting for, which is the other half of the
reported defect. So a phase from a hidden role is dropped at the door, in
`PostPhaseNews`, and never reaches a drawing site to be filtered by whoever
remembered to. `Visible` is `internal/lane/roles.go`'s field, and the table is
the only place any of these four numbers is written down:

| role | interactive | quality bar | horizon | visible | verb |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `talk` | yes | 0.90 | 50 | **yes** | writing |
| `leaf.attached` | yes | 0.90 | 50 | **yes** | writing |
| `leaf.unattended` | no (critical) | 0.90 | 50 | no | writing |
| `standing` | no | 0.90 | 20 | no | writing |
| `memory` | no | 0.80 | 10 | no | writing |
| `auxiliary` | no | 0.80 | 10 | no | writing |
| `judge` | no (critical) | 0.95 | 10 | no | writing |
| `design` | no (critical) | 0.90 | 20 | no | writing |
| `probe` | no | — | 1 | no | writing |
| `media` | yes | — | 1 | **yes** | **drawing** — it produces no token stream at all, so it takes the deadline-only half of the watch |
| *(unnamed)* | no | 0.80 | 10 | no | writing — a call that named nothing reads as a background errand, which is the conservative direction |

**THERE IS NO ROLE FOR A HEDGE**, and the absence is the law rather than an
omission. The second request of a race is the SAME ERRAND as the first — the same
person is waiting for the same answer — so it inherits the role it is rescuing
and is routed, priced and drawn exactly as that errand is. A role of its own
would say that the rescue of a naming errand was something somebody is reading,
which is the very leak the `Visible` column exists to close.

An unregistered role reads as the unnamed row rather than as a zero struct, so a
name nobody added to the table behaves like a background errand instead of like
a free one. `Verb` is here rather than in the surface because a role is what
decides it: everything that makes text is `writing` and media is `drawing`.


## What this is not

- **Not a message bus.** Nodes do not talk to each other; they read folds and
  the CAS (pull), and the schedule orders mutations (STATE edges). Free-form
  inter-node RPC invites deadlock and context pollution for nothing the pull
  model doesn't provide.
- **Not a vector database.** Recall starts as FTS over digests keyed by intent
  and workspace. Add embeddings only when a measured recall failure demands it.
- **Not distributed.** One host and one lease-elected resident per database.
  The event log keeps the door open; nothing walks through it yet.
- **Not two products.** The headless command is a lens on the same brain, not a
  scripting-flavoured reimplementation of it. A feature that exists in chat and
  not headless — or that behaves differently there — is a bug in the seam.

## Migration map

| milestone | what lands | what it unlocks |
|---|---|---|
| M1 | `internal/store`: SQLite events + views behind the existing run; `codeaf resume` | crash-proof runs, real accounting; the silent-death class of failure becomes impossible |
| M2 | resident lease + visitor surfaces; spine + splice + fold | universal cross-session graph; many-terminal attach; history queries |
| M3 | trigger engine + `plant_trigger` tool + rails | time/file/webhook/graph reactivity; the agent schedules itself |
| M4 | ground-time recall + executor fold-query tool | the agent that remembers its territory |

M1 is prerequisite to everything and valuable alone. Each later milestone is
independently shippable, and the one-shot CLI works unchanged at every point.
