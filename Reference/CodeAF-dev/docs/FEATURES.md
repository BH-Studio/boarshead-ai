# codeaf — everything it can do

This is the master feature catalog: one entry per capability, each with
where it lives, how it's used, and the tip-worthy phrasing. It exists to
be *mined* — a trivial LLM call over this document (plus the user's usage
profile from the notebook/journal) can generate the one contextual hint
worth showing while work runs: surface features they haven't touched,
deepen ones they use shallowly. Keep entries self-contained; a tip
generator should be able to lift any single entry without context.

Format per entry — **What** · **Where** · **How** · **Tip seed** (a
one-line hint a user would actually thank you for).

---

## 1. Talking to it

### Just talk — the compiler classifies, you don't
**What**: There are no mode commands. Plain language becomes an answer, a
reflex, a task, a project, or a standing goal based on the *shape* of the
ask — scale is read from structure, duration from temporal language.
**Where**: the chat input, always.
**How**: "open that file" → instant reflex; "fix the flaky test" → task;
"whenever a PR opens, review it" → standing-goal ratification card.
**Tip seed**: You never need to tell codeaf how big a job is — say what
you want; it decides ceremony, and misreads are corrected by just saying so.

### The reflex ladder — trivial asks stay trivial
**What**: Four ceremony rungs: answer (no work), reflex (one journaled
micro-leaf, no planner, 1/8 budget), task (compiled), project (subtree).
Reversibility, not size, licenses a reflex; overruns promote upward,
never silently down.
**Where**: automatic in chat.
**Tip seed**: Small asks ("rename this", "open that") don't build task
ceremony — they run as reflexes and still leave a journal trail.

### Ask it to change work in flight
**What**: Cancel, amend, pause, or redirect running/planned nodes
conversationally; the head resolves which node you mean, asks back with
options only when ambiguous, and gates consequential surgery behind a
confirm question.
**Where**: chat, any time work is on the graph.
**How**: "cancel the audio job", "make the PR watcher hourly", "stop
watching PRs".
**Tip seed**: You can redirect running work by talking about it — no need
to find an id or a kill switch.

### Questions come with numbers
**What**: When codeaf needs you, it asks with structured components:
choose (vertical `▸ 1 …` rows with dim hints), confirm (`▸ 1 yes · ▸ 2
no`, enter accepts the marked default), text (a dim `answering: <prompt>`
line above the input). Number keys, arrows+enter, click, or free text all
answer; typing your own words always wins.
**Where**: in the thread and on job cards.
**Tip seed**: Press the option's number — or ignore the options entirely
and type what you actually want; free text always beats the menu.

### A stuck question finds you
**What**: A job waiting >2 minutes on an answer promotes its card to the
dock's top slot with a violet `?`, and the header tasks button carries a
violet dot while anything anywhere is waiting.
**Where**: dock strip + header, even with the rail closed.
**Tip seed**: A violet dot on ⟨tasks⟩ means something is waiting on you —
click it to jump straight to the question.

## 2. Voice and media

### Speak instead of typing
**What**: Mic in the input bar (alt+v or click). While you talk: breathing
glyph, live 8-bar waveform, elapsed time, and your words appearing as
faint provisional text — cut at natural pauses, transcribed while you
keep speaking. Stop → one full-clip pass replaces it with final, editable
text, cursor at the end.
**Where**: right edge of the input bar; alt+v toggles, esc discards.
**How**: whatever you had typed stays — voice *appends* to your draft, in
every path including cancel and failure.
**Tip seed**: alt+v talks; your typed draft is never lost — voice adds to
it, and esc discards only the voice.

### Show it images, hand it documents
**What**: Drag an image or a `.pdf`/`.docx`/`.pptx` into the terminal — the
path becomes a dim `⌾ name.png ⟨×⟩` (or `▤`) chip above the input. Sending
copies the file into codeaf's own store, so the durable thread holds a copy
rather than a pointer at yours: a retry next week and a follow-up tomorrow
read exactly what you attached even after you have moved or deleted it.
Images ride to the talk model when it has vision, and are staged into the
job's workspace either way, so a worker can look with the vision model — and
when nothing can see, the answer says so.
**Where**: input bar; ⟨×⟩ or backspace-on-empty removes.
**Tip seed**: Drag a screenshot straight into the chat — attaching copies it,
so tidying your Downloads folder never breaks a job.

### Getting work out
**What**: A deliverable's path prints in full and renders as a link your
terminal opens. `y` copies the focused answer, `Y` copies the file it
produced, `/open` hands that file to your machine's opener. The copy rides
the terminal's own clipboard, so it works over ssh.
**Where**: thread; the focused answer, or the last one.
**Tip seed**: `y` copies the answer, `Y` copies its file — even over ssh.

### Tasks can generate media — any task, any time
**What**: `generate_image`, `speak` (TTS), `generate_music`,
`generate_video`, and `view_image` are graph tools available to every
leaf — chat reflexes and headless runs alike. Artifacts land in the task
workspace under `media/` with readable names and render as one clickable
line (`⌾` image, `♪` audio, `▶` video) that opens in your OS viewer.
**Where**: any task; just ask ("make a diagram of this", "generate an
intro jingle").
**Tip seed**: Ask any task for a diagram, a voiceover, a jingle, or a
clip — media generation is a tool every job already has.

### Model slots — the right model per modality
**What**: Standing slots: talk, work, plan, voice (transcription), image,
speech, music, video, boost. Defaults resolve against a live catalog
(krea-2-medium-turbo images, fish-audio/s1 speech, qwen3-asr-flash
transcription, lyria-3-pro-preview music, seedance-2.0-mini video) and degrade
gracefully if a slug disappears. Each slot's picker only lists models
that can actually do that job.
**Where**: click any `⌄` model name in the header → type-to-search
dropdown; env overrides (`CODEAF_IMAGE_MODEL`, …) for headless.
**Tip seed**: Click a model name in the header to change it — the list is
pre-filtered to models capable of that slot's job, so you can't pick wrong.

### Plan/work split — a strong model plans, a cheap model executes
**What**: Two roles inside every task: the *plan* model structures (task
graph, replans after a landed result, per-leaf contracts, ruler
recalibration, the delivery gate) and the *work* model executes the
leaves. The plan slot is empty by default and follows the work model
live — one model does both until you split them. A change lands on the
very next planning call; the sizing ruler stays keyed to the work model,
because it measures the executor.
**Where**: chat: `plan` row in the model palette / settings sheet
(pick "follow work" to rejoin). Headless: `CODEAF_PLAN_MODEL`, or per
run `codeaf plan|revise|run --model <work> --plan-model <plan>`.
**Tip seed**: Put a frontier model on `plan` and a flash-tier model on
`work` — the graph, the replans, and the gate get the judgment while the
leaves stay cheap.

## 3. Standing goals — it acts without being asked

### Say it once, it stands forever
**What**: Durable language ("whenever…", "every morning…", "keep the
suite green", "remind me tomorrow at 9") is *recognized*, never declared —
no /goal command exists. What comes back is the one ceremony in the
system: a ratification card quoting the watch, cost (from measured
history when available), and rails, with `▸ 1 yes · ▸ 2 change cadence ·
▸ 3 once, not standing`.
**Where**: chat; the card appears before anything stands.
**Tip seed**: "Remind me Friday at 3" or "watch this folder" just works —
you'll approve the standing cost once, then it's furniture.

### It keeps watch when you're not here
**What**: The first time a charter is ratified, and only then, one
question is asked in the resident's voice: "Should I keep watching this
when you're not here? `▸ 1 yes, always · ▸ 2 only while I'm around`".
Yes arranges a quiet five-minute check that keeps running with no
terminal open, and answers with a single line. Either answer is durable
and the question is never asked twice — not after a restart, not on the
next charter.
**Where**: chat, immediately after the first ratification.
**Tip seed**: Say "yes, always" once and your standing goals keep firing
with every window closed; say "only while I'm around" and they wait for
you — either way you're asked exactly once.

### The standing rail — felt, not seen
**What**: One dim line per charter above tasks (`⏱ pr-watch · last fired
2h · 3 today`), breathing only while a sentinel evaluates or a firing
runs. Routine "checked, nothing to do" firings never touch the thread —
only questions, deliveries, and failures earn a card.
**Where**: the rail (alt+g or header ⟨tasks⟩).
**Tip seed**: Quiet standing lines are good news — a goal only speaks
when it has something worth saying.

### Zoom from goal to everything it ever did
**What**: Click a standing line → the charter card: invariant in your
words, watch, rails, and firing history (when, outcome, cost). Click a
firing → its full job graph, the same flight recorder every task has.
Esc walks back up: graph → card → rail.
**Where**: rail → charter card → firing drill-in.
**Tip seed**: Wondering what a goal has been doing? Click its line — the
history with costs is one click deep, the full graphs two.

### Manage goals by talking (or clicking)
**What**: "pause the PR watcher", "make it hourly", "stop watching PRs" —
references resolve by searching the invariants; ambiguity asks back with
options. The charter card offers the same verbs as clicks, and offers only
the ones this charter's state can perform: pause or resume, retire, and edit
cadence — which turns the row itself into a field rather than opening a
dialog. A proposal's first row stands it up. Click and sentence journal the
identical typed charter command. `/standing` lists all charters.
**Tip seed**: There's no goals settings page — say "pause it" or click
the goal's line; both end in the same journaled event.

### It may propose — you always dispose
**What**: When the retrospective notices the same-shaped ask ≥3 times, it
may propose one charter per reflection — the same ratification card,
marked `proposed · noticed you ask this most mornings`, default-declined.
Declining is remembered and never re-asked.
**Tip seed**: If codeaf notices you asking for the same thing most
mornings, it will offer — once — to just do it every morning.

## 4. Money, not tokens

### The dollar rail
**What**: The only budget is dollars — $20/day default. No token caps, no
turn caps that kill work: a task stops for done, or for your word. At
the ceiling, work pauses and asks; a raise is a journaled event.
**Where**: `/budget` shows today (`spent $3.40 of $20 · resets
midnight`); `/budget 50` raises today; `/budget default 35` persists;
`/budget unlimited today` uncaps the day. Header shows the running cost.
Headless: `CODEAF_DAILY_BUDGET`, `--yes-spend` to preauthorize.
**Tip seed**: Nothing ever dies from a token limit — if the daily
dollars run out, work pauses and asks; `/budget 50` resumes it.

### Every modality is railed
**What**: Image/speech/music/video generation, charter firings,
transcription — all draw admission from the same daily rail and record
real cost from the provider's usage data. Charter firings carry
per-firing quotes and daily caps on top.
**Tip seed**: One number governs everything codeaf spends today — check
it any time with /budget.

## 5. It gets better as you use it

### The notebook — beliefs, not logs
**What**: Preferences, quirks, lessons, and facts are captured from every
stage of work, consolidated with evidence links, superseded on
contradiction, aged, and quarantined when poisoned (with injection
attribution). Wrong beliefs are correctable: "that's wrong, retract it."
**Where**: automatic; `codeaf notebook` inspects; retract works in chat.
**Tip seed**: If codeaf keeps repeating a wrong assumption, tell it to
retract that — beliefs are journaled and die on command.

### The skill forge — tools it builds itself
**What**: When work reveals a repeatable procedure, it becomes a
candidate skill; promotion requires the skill's check script to actually
pass (execution-gated), then it's delivered to future leaves via PATH +
retrieval. Nothing is hard-coded — capability emerges from use.
**Tip seed**: Scripts codeaf writes twice tend to become tools it owns —
your recurring workflows are being quietly compiled into capability.

### Experiments over faith
**What**: When two approaches compete and evidence is thin, the
disagreement is stored as an *unsettled pair*; future work runs trials
against it and settles it mechanically, with provenance.
**Tip seed**: codeaf doesn't argue with itself twice — unresolved
approach debates become experiments the next relevant job runs.

### Playbooks per scope
**What**: Each work scope accumulates a delta-updated playbook (never
wholesale rewritten) of what works there, composed into contracts for
future jobs in that scope.
**Tip seed**: The tenth job in a repo starts smarter than the first —
scopes carry earned playbooks.

### The router learns who's good at what
**What**: Model capability is measured per work-shape (Rasch ratings)
from verified outcomes only; planning cascades cheap→capable; leaf
execution pins openers by measured fit. Mispredictions feed a surprise
ledger the retrospective attends to first.
**Tip seed**: You don't pick models per task — measured history routes
each job shape to the cheapest model that verifiably handles it.

### Recall — it remembers everything it did
**What**: Full-text recall over verbatim intents, summaries, and fold
digests; executors can pull relevant history mid-task; the head answers
"have we done this before?" from the journal.
**Tip seed**: Ask "how did we solve this last time?" — the graph is
permanent and searchable, including packed history.

### The retrospective — territories, proposals, self-knowledge
**What**: A background reflection packs settled jobs into territories
(folds of folds), audits beliefs, proposes charters, and updates
per-model self-knowledge — attending first to whatever surprised it.
**Tip seed**: Old jobs get packed into territories — the rail stays calm
at any history size, and nothing is deleted, only folded.

## 6. The curious employee — self-directed life on rails

### The practice loop — it studies its own weaknesses
**What**: Real work leaves behind *questions* (gaps revealed by failures,
corrections, and scopes where its predictions stay wrong past enough
samples). When you're away and nothing user-origin is in flight, a
practice charter with its own small dollar carve-out picks the highest
value question — relevance × execution-verifiability × measured learning
progress — and splices an `origin: self` practice job. Results feed the
surprise ledger and the skill forge, never your thread. Questions whose
scope shows no surprise reduction after two rounds retire automatically.
**Where**: automatic when idle; `CODEAF_PRACTICE_BUDGET` (default $2/day,
0 disables), `CODEAF_PRACTICE_IDLE` (default 20m).
**Tip seed**: The quiet hours aren't idle — codeaf practices what it got
wrong last week, on its own budget, and stops when practice stops paying.

### The morning brief — arrival, folded
**What**: Open chat after a real absence and the first thing in the
thread is one collapsed card: "While you were away — N things done, a
question, $X." Enter unfolds slim rows (done, failed, fired charters,
facts learned, spend), each anchored to durable provenance. Short breaks
stay silent; nothing happened means nothing appears.
**Where**: automatic on session open; `CODEAF_BRIEF_AFTER` (default 4h,
0 = always).
**Tip seed**: You don't owe the scrollback anything — the arrival fold is
the complete account of what happened while you were gone.

### The question queue — it saves its questions for the 1:1
**What**: Non-blocking questions accumulate instead of interrupting: a
dock row with a `?` glyph, count-collapsed, surfaced at most one per
natural moment (arrival, after a delivery). Answering happens inline in
chat; questions whose originating job settled another way expire with a
journaled reason.
**Where**: the dock; answers route through normal chat.
**Tip seed**: codeaf is probably holding questions for you — the `?` row
in the dock is its saved-up 1:1 list, never a popup.

### Curiosity receipts — self-spend must pay learning rent
**What**: Every dollar spent on itself (practice, retrospectives, folds)
produces a journaled receipt: what it tried, what it cost, what was
learned (facts, skills, surprise delta) — or explicitly "nothing." Two
consecutive nothing-receipts on an inquiry line auto-retire it and pause
its charter, with the reason journaled as self-origin evidence.
**Where**: `codeaf why self` prints today's receipts; surfaces read
`SelfSpendToday` as one number.
**Tip seed**: Ask `codeaf why self` — every cent it spent on itself comes
with a receipt saying what it learned, and freeloading inquiries fire
themselves.

### The competence map — grounded self-knowledge
**What**: From the surprise ledger, failure rates, installed skills, and
territories, every scope is classified strong / frontier (the 25–75%
learnable band) / weak / stale. The head answers "what are you good at?"
from this evidence, and the frontier list is exactly what the practice
loop targets.
**Where**: `codeaf competence` for the calm rows; in chat, just ask.
**Tip seed**: "What are you actually good at now?" gets a measured answer
— strong scopes, the learning frontier, and where it still struggles.

### Probation → tenure — autonomy is earned, not granted
**What**: Every new charter starts on probation: a firing produces a
proposal ("I would have done X now — approve?") instead of work. Three
consecutive approved, green firings promote it — one line in the thread,
"I'll handle this on my own now" — and it fires autonomously. A failure,
budget breach, or rejected output demotes it back; two demotions pause it.
"Always allow" promotes immediately; "never" declines and pauses.
**Where**: automatic on all charters; `CODEAF_TENURE_AFTER` tunes the
threshold.
**Tip seed**: New standing goals ask before acting — approve a few good
runs and they earn tenure; one bad run and they're back to asking.

## 7. The surface

### Three places: thread · board · self
**What**: The header's left side is the whole map — thread (the conversation,
home), board (live jobs, the graph, standing goals — the old tasks rail
promoted), self (the employee's file: today's receipts, the competence map,
newest beliefs, and each standing goal's tenure grade). Attention dots light
per place from that place's own sources; esc always walks home to thread.
**Where**: click the words, or alt+1 / alt+2 / alt+3 (alt+g and ⟨tasks⟩ still
open the board); `/self`.
**Tip seed**: Wondering what it's learned or earned lately? alt+3 opens its
file — receipts, competence, beliefs, and tenure, one calm column.

### The presence line — you can hear it working
**What**: One dim line in the rail (and dock hint) while the resident works on
itself: "practicing: goreleaser edge cases · $0.31 on myself today", with a
brief "learned: …" clause when a round pays off. Silence when idle. Self-work
never masquerades as your job cards, and the header spend meter carries a
"· N¢ self" suffix whenever it spent on itself today.
**Where**: automatic; the rail and the header meter.
**Tip seed**: The dim line under the rail is the sound of it studying — and
every cent it spends on itself shows up labelled "self" in the meter.


### Living job cards
**What**: Work lives as cards with four states (compiling, working,
question, settled); active cards dock above the input, settle at their
birth position in the thread, and expand through a disclosure ladder
into the rail's flight recorder.
**Tip seed**: A settled card sits where you asked for it — scroll back to
where the conversation was, not to a log.

### Everything clicks; everything has a key
**What**: Every affordance is explicit (no hover exists): `▸`/`▾` expand,
`⋯` more, `⟨×⟩` dismiss, `⌄` opens a picker. Focus zones cycle
input→dock→thread→rail; arrows+enter act; esc backs out one rung; alt+g
or header ⟨tasks ▸⟩ toggles the rail; slash commands complete inline.
**Tip seed**: If you see ▸ ▾ ⋯ ⟨×⟩ ⌄ — it's clickable, and the keyboard
path always exists (arrows, enter, esc, alt+g, alt+v).

### Honest motion
**What**: Replies stream token-by-token; running work shimmers
left-to-right; plans stream while forming; file paths are clickable
(OSC8); tool calls render with kind glyph + accent name, failures rose
`✗`, outputs guttered.
**Tip seed**: The shimmer isn't decoration — something breathing means
something is actually running; click ⟨tasks⟩ to see exactly what.

### Interruption survival
**What**: Close the terminal mid-run and nothing haunts: on reopen,
orphaned claims release, recovered work resumes with a one-line notice,
and the head's snapshot always shows live work first.
**Tip seed**: Killing the terminal never strands a task — reopen and it
resumes where it left off, saying so once.

## 8. Headless — the same power, scripted

> The full contract — every flag, the exit codes, the `--json` schema, the
> stream discipline, and the rules for measuring codeaf — is
> [HEADLESS.md](HEADLESS.md). This section is the catalog entry; that file is
> what a harness is written against.

### `codeaf do` — one errand, the whole living brain
**What**: The task, done, with nobody watching. Not the static pipeline: this
is the resident's own brain with the conversation removed, so the contract for
the work, the delivery gate, the repair a cited gap earns, and the replan when
a leaf runs out of room are all still there. It works in the directory you're
standing in and edits it in place.
**Where**: `codeaf do "<task>" [-w dir] [-db path] [--json] [--yes-spend]`
**How**: The exit code is the verdict — `0` worked, `1` didn't, `2` hit the
wall with partial work. `--json` prints one object with the deliverable, the
artifacts, real spend, node count, and `blocked_on` when a question stopped it.
Share one `-db` across runs and the second run knows what the first learned;
omit it and the store is private and deleted on the way out.
**Tip seed**: codeaf do runs a whole job from one command — and its exit code
is honest enough to put in a script.

### `codeaf plan` / `codeaf run`
**What**: The benchmarked, byte-stable CLI path: compile a goal to a
plan, run it with the atomic linear harness. Learning surfaces
(anchors, playbooks, router) feed it without changing its contract.
**Tip seed**: CI and scripts use codeaf plan/run — same tools, same
rails, no chat needed.

### `codeaf wake`
**What**: One watch pass over due charters — evaluate sentinels, fire
what's due, journal the pass, exit. This is the command the standing
watch runs for you every five minutes; running it by hand is the same
pass, now.
**Tip seed**: codeaf wake runs one standing pass right now instead of
waiting for the next check.

### `codeaf doctor`
**What**: Five calm rows and nothing else: the brain file and its size,
who is resident right now, whether the standing watch is on with its last
wake and next check, today's spend against the rail, and how many goals
are active with how many questions pending. The same rows ground the
answer when you ask "who's keeping watch?" in chat.
**Tip seed**: codeaf doctor answers "is it actually running, and what has
it cost me today?" in five lines.

### `codeaf competence` / `codeaf why self`
**What**: The self-knowledge pair from the CLI: measured per-scope
competence (strong / frontier / weak / stale), and today's self-spend
receipts with what each attempt learned.
**Tip seed**: Two commands answer "is it actually getting better?" —
codeaf competence for the map, codeaf why self for the receipts.

### `codeaf notebook`
**What**: Inspect, search, and retract beliefs from the CLI.
**Tip seed**: codeaf notebook shows what it believes — and what evidence
each belief stands on.

### Environment
**What**: `CODEAF_DAILY_BUDGET`, `CODEAF_PREAUTHORIZE_SPEND`/`--yes-spend`,
`CODEAF_PRACTICE_BUDGET`, `CODEAF_PRACTICE_IDLE`, `CODEAF_BRIEF_AFTER`,
`CODEAF_TENURE_AFTER`, `CODEAF_VOICE_MODEL`, `CODEAF_IMAGE_MODEL`,
`CODEAF_SPEECH_MODEL`, `CODEAF_MUSIC_MODEL`, `CODEAF_VIDEO_MODEL`,
profile dir config at `~/.codeaf/config.json`.

## The runtime source of truth is `internal/manual`, not this file

This catalog is a design document: it is on disk, it is written to
persuade, and it goes stale the moment a build lands. What codeaf
actually *says* about itself at runtime comes from `internal/manual` — a
small set of user-voice markdown pages embedded in the binary, searched
by the `manual` tool on the head's tool belt and injected into the
router's grounding context when a self-question is recognized. Those
pages are the authority: where they and this file disagree, they win. The
retrieval probes in `internal/manual`, the slash-command and alias gate in
`internal/tui3/manual_test.go`, and the tool-belt gate in
`internal/session/manual_test.go` fail the build when the runtime corpus cannot
answer for what the live chat exposes. Add a feature, add its paragraph there;
update this entry afterwards if you like, but never instead.

---

## Using this document for hints

The intended pipeline: `(this file + user's recent usage signals) → one
cheap LLM call → one hint`. Selection guidance for that call:
- Prefer entries whose surface the user has *never* touched (journal
  shows no alt+v? offer the voice tip).
- Prefer deepenings of shallow use (uses /budget to check but never set
  a default? offer `/budget default`).
- Never more than one hint at a time; render it as one dim line in the
  help position, dismissible, never modal — the same Apple-calm rules as
  everything else.
- Tip seeds are starting points; regenerate phrasing in the system's
  voice, don't quote verbatim.
