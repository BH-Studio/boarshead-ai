# Settlement: why eight runs declared victory over work they had not done

*Written 2026-08-29 against `bench/deepswe/AUTOPSY.md` and the ten stores under
`bench/deepswe/results/`. Ten headless `codeaf do` runs, five DeepSWE tasks, two
seeds, every model knob pinned to one model, each in its own graded container.
Eight graded runs, eight exit 0, eight rewards of 0. The median run stopped at
ten minutes of a ninety-minute wall having spent eight cents.*

This document is the reasoning behind the change. It is written the way
[FAILSAFE.md](../failsafe/FAILSAFE.md) asked for: each defect named at the line
it lives on, each fix stated as a law rather than as a patch, and every clause of
the fail-safe rule the defect broke said out loud.

## The shape of the failure

Seven of the eight graded runs settled AFTER their own review gate had named the
missing work and been refused with one sentence:

> `gate: refused — what the review asked for next is not in the request`

igel s1, node `task-39`, at four minutes and six seconds of ninety:

> The deliverable does not contain the actual code changes that implement the
> feature schema persistence and validation rules.

The review was right. The node then wrote "All 41 tests pass. Here's a summary of
what was done", and the process exited 0.

So the gate saw the gap, said the gap, was overruled by a rule, and the exit code
sided with the rule. Three separate mechanisms had to agree for that to happen,
and all three are wrong in the same direction: **each of them treats the absence
of an argument as evidence of completeness.**

## 1. Grounding: the invariant asked the wrong question

`internal/revision/judge.go:1230`, `citationGrounded`, decides whether a review's
finding may buy work. Its test is one line:

```go
if strings.Contains(ground, key) { return true }
```

— the finding, whitespace-normalised, must be ONE CONTIGUOUS RUN of characters
inside the request. Read the ten stores and that single line accounts for most of
the sweep.

### 1a. A quotation may elide, and the rule did not know it

Seven of the ten refused citations are quotations of the request that skip a
middle. igel s1 `task-39` cited, verbatim except for one elision:

> "After fit, write feature_schema.joblib in the results directory and record
> feature_schema_path, input_features, dropped_features, and
> duplicate_feature_aliases in description.json. dropped_features must be an
> object with excluded, constant, and duplicate lists. dataset.features must
> support include, exclude, drop_constant, and drop_duplicate. **...** evaluate,
> predict, and /predict must load and apply the persisted schema before any model
> call."

Every character on either side of the `...` is the person's own text. The whole
string is a substring of nothing, so the finding was refused as an invention and
the run settled. textual (both seeds), ink s2, happy-dom s3 and igel s2 (both
gates) fail exactly this way; the marker is `...` or a bare `…` depending on what
the model felt like typing.

This is FAILSAFE clause 1 — *detect by structure, not by vocabulary* — worn the
other way round. The structural fact is that **a quotation is a sequence of
spans**, and the rule was reading it as a single token of prose.

### 1b. Two doors, two ground sets

`AdmitGapRevision` (`judge.go:1269`) grounds a finding against the request AND the
working method. `ExtendForGap` (`judge.go:1377`) grounds it against the request
ALONE. So a finding that quotes the method survives the first door and dies at
the second, having already cost a repair round.

ink s1 spent both of its gates on this. Its citation, both times:

> "The whole finished implementation is written out in the worker's own final
> message, not merely saved to a file."

That is the working method, verbatim — a standard fixed before the work started,
that the worker was actually held to. happy-dom s1's second gate is the same
shape. This is the two-components-two-contracts defect FAILSAFE already named
once, in the row about the mechanical gate and the citation invariant.

### 1c. Neither door could see what the plan promised

`MissingProduces` (`internal/revision/produces.go:48`) emits its citations FROM
`plan.Done.Produces`, and `Evidence.Done` already carries that structure to the
judge — but no grounding rule reads it. A finding that names an output the
compiled plan promised, in the plan's own words, is grounded by construction, and
was being refused for not appearing in the request's prose.

### The law

> **A finding is grounded when everything it points at is something this run
> promised before it began working.**

Three things were promised before the work started and cannot have moved in
response to it: the person's request, the working method the leaf was held to,
and the compiled plan's own promises (its aim, its `Produces`, its
`Conditions`). Those three are now one value, `revision.Grounds`, and BOTH doors
weigh a finding against all three. One contract, one reader.

A citation is grounded three ways, each on its own terms:

1. **As a quotation.** It is split at its elisions and every segment must be a
   verbatim span of some ground. An elision is a structural mark — three or more
   dots, or `…` — and not a word, so this stays a structural test.
2. **As a file name.** Unchanged: the same file under either spelling, by
   `namesSameFile`.
3. **As a named thing.** This is the entailment door, and it is what admits
   "does not implement X" where X is what the request asks for. A citation that
   is neither a quotation nor a file name is grounded when it names at least one
   SYMBOL that a ground also names and names no symbol that no ground names.

A symbol is recognised by shape, the way `namedFile` and `enumerationItem`
already are in this package: a token carrying an internal `_`, `.`, `/` or `-`,
an internal capital, or a digit beside letters — `dataset.features`,
`is_following_end`, `IntersectionObserver`, `gridTemplateColumns`, `HTTP`. A
plain English word is deliberately NOT a symbol, and that is the line that keeps
self-authored scope out: the measured failure this whole invariant exists for was
a gate holding a worker to "March refers to any calendar year present in the
data", where "March" is the person's word and "calendar year present in the data"
is the run's own. Under the shape rule that citation names no symbol, so the
entailment door does not open for it and it is refused exactly as before.

**What is still refused.** Prose that quotes nothing, names no file, and names no
symbol any ground names. That is the whole of what self-authored scope looks
like, and it is what the limiter was always for. FAILSAFE clause 5 is explicit
that the limiter's job is to stop rounds that invent scope, not rounds that close
promised scope; before this change it could not tell the two apart, because it
was asking about characters rather than about promises.

## 2. A refused finding was settling the run whole

`cmd/codeaf/do.go:1483`, `deliveredWhole`, is where the exit code is decided:

```go
!gate.Pass && !gate.PolishClosed &&
    (gate.Mechanical || gate.Unclosed || strings.TrimSpace(gate.Refused) == "")
```

Read it in the other direction: **any refusal at all, unless it was mechanical or
unclosed, makes the run whole.** `store.DeliveryGate.Refused` is one field
holding refusals of two categorically different kinds, and the exit code cannot
tell them apart:

| refusal | what it checked | what it proves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AdmitGapArtifact` — "already on disk under the name the request used" | the filesystem | the finding is WRONG. The thing is there. |
| `AdmitGapPresent` — "already in the delivered text" | the deliverable | the finding is WRONG. The thing is there. |
| `admitGapCitations` — "not in the request" | the finding's provenance | only that no round will be BOUGHT |
| the spent ledger — "the same words were already worked on once" | the ledger | only that no round will be bought |

The first two are FAILSAFE clause 2 in good working order: evidence sourced from
the world, and it overturns the finding. The last two check nothing about the
world at all. Refusing a citation on provenance declines to spend money; it does
not make the missing work appear. The run is still handing over less than it
promised, and it was handing it over as success.

> **A refusal acquits only when it was checked against the world. A finding
> refused on provenance, or left unclosed, still stands, and a run that ends with
> a finding standing is partial.**

`store.DeliveryGate` gains one field, `Overturned`, recorded rather than inferred
for the reason `Unclosed` was: it is the field the exit code turns on, and a
sentence is not a field. `deliveredWhole` now reads: a failing gate delivers
whole only when the polish closed it or the finding was overturned against the
world.

And the stream has to say which finding. `gateWords` (`do.go:1174`) printed the
refusal sentence and nothing else, so a person watching read
"refused — what the review asked for next is not in the request" and never
learned what the review had said was missing. It now names the finding first and
the reason second, because the finding is the news.

## 3. Ten minutes of ninety, by choice

Nothing ran out. The wall is 5400 seconds; the runs stopped at 220, 246, 580,
591, 622, 837, 1528 and 1659 seconds, having spent between five and twenty cents
of an unbounded allowance. **Every one of them chose to stop.** Raising the wall
buys nothing; raising a retry count buys a retry of the same blind decision. That
is the defect stated plainly: *a run with 86 minutes and 99% of its money left,
holding a finding it agrees with, stopped.*

Two things made stopping the default.

The first is grounding, above: an unadmitted finding never reaches
`ReplanOverrunAs`, so the growth governor — the one component in this system that
decides from measured evidence — was never asked.

The second is the spent-citation ledger (`AdmitGapCitation`, `judge.go:1125`),
which is a count of one wearing the clothes of an invariant: words that bought a
round may never buy another, whatever that round did. That is the same species of
mistake as a retry count. The settle lane already built the thing that decides
this properly — `store.JobGrowth` records, per round, how many files the round
actually left behind (`Produced`, `Measured`) and a digest of the remainder it
was aimed at (`Remainder`) — and `growJob` (`internal/resident/grow.go:394`)
already refuses a lineage that has changed nothing twice (standstill) or been
handed the same remainder twice (fixed point).

> **The ledger bounds SCOPE; the growth journal bounds REPETITION.** A citation
> already worked on may buy one further round when the journal shows the round it
> bought actually moved the tree. When the journal shows it moved nothing, the
> veto stands, and when there is no journal to read the veto stands — the
> fail-safe direction for a bound on new work.

Convergence survives, and is now stronger than it was: standstill stops a lineage
after two fruitless rounds, the fixed point stops a gate that names the same gap
twice, `MaxOverrunRounds` remains the backstop it says it is, and the daily rail
still pauses for consent. None of those is a clock and none of them is new here.

One clock does enter, and only as a floor. `ExtendForGap` now asks whether the
run's own deadline still holds room for a leaf to run; if it does not, the gap is
refused as **unclosed** — which under §2 is exit 2, partial. Buying a round that
the wall will kill mid-flight spends money to deliver nothing, and pretending a
run that had no time is a run that was whole is the same lie in a different
field. The floor is derived, not typed: see PERF.md.

## 4. Regression is a blocker, and the evidence must come from the world

igel s2 and both textual runs shipped a patch that deleted an attribute the
repository already had:

```
AttributeError: <class 'igel.igel.Igel'> has no attribute 'results_path'
RichLog object has no attribute '_size_known'
```

Every one of the twenty-four hidden fail-to-pass tests failed on setup. The
leaf's own narrow tests were green — it wrote them, and they do not touch
`results_path` — so from inside the run there was no signal at all. igel s2 ran
the tests thirty-three times, three times as often as s1, and scored 5 → 0. Test
COUNT correlates with nothing. What none of the ten runs did was run the
project's own suite before and after and treat a new failure as a blocker.

The machinery for this exists and is unreachable. `fullverification.Discover`
found the project's own build and test entrypoints from `package.json` scripts,
`Makefile` targets, CI workflow files, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject`;
`codeaf`'s baseline photographed them before the work and named the tests that
had gone from green to red. Both lived inside the imported engine's own
`internal/` tree, which by Go's own rule nothing outside it may import, so the
worker `codeaf do` uses on the plain path could not have it. That path never set
`Outcome.Baseline`, and an empty `Baseline` reads downstream as *no claim*, not
as *nobody looked*.

> **A check that passed before the work and fails after it is a finding the gate
> raises itself, and it is admitted without any citation.**

The law moves to `internal/verify`, one package, reachable by everyone: discover
the project's own entrypoints, run one, read the failing test names out of its
output, and name the ones that are new. One package owns it, so nobody keeps a
second copy. A worker photographs the project's own verification before its
first turn and again after its last and carries what it finds on the outcome;
where none did, the delivery gate takes the reading itself.

Grounding does not apply to this finding and must not. A regression is not a
reading of the request — it is a measurement of the world, which is FAILSAFE
clause 2 exactly, and there is no citation to weigh because the person never had
to ask for their repository to keep working. `Judgment.Sourced` says so, the
admission rules step aside for it, and `deliveredWhole` reads it the way it reads
a mechanical gap: no refusal of a citation can make a red test green.

**The cost is bounded, and derived.** A photograph is taken only when the project
declares a verification entrypoint at all, only when the tree actually changed
between the two readings, and each run is capped at a share of the leaf's own
wall — a leaf too short to afford the measurement does not take it, rather than
spending its whole life measuring. The share and its arithmetic are in PERF.md,
which is where every cap in this repository is stated once.

## What is deliberately not here

No new retry counts. No new timeouts as levers — the one clock added is a floor
that refuses to buy work the wall cannot hold, and it makes runs longer, not
shorter. No new models and no new calls on the common path: the grounding work is
string shape, the settlement work is a field, and the regression work is the
project's own command, which the run was already running by hand nine times an
hour without ever comparing two readings of it.

---

# The s5 sweep: one record, one verdict, and what may overturn a finding

*Appended 2026-08-29 against `bench/deepswe/results/*-s5/` — the first sweep run
on a binary carrying §1–§4 above. Five tasks, one seed. igel ended exit 2 with
its finding named, which is what §2 was built to do. The other four did not, and
the three defects below are why.*

## 5. The record the gate reads is the job's, not the node's

`cmd/codeaf/chat.go`, `gateEvidence`. The gate's `Evidence.Artifacts` was the
artifacts of THE ONE LEAF being judged — `outcome.Artifacts` joined onto the job
directory. The settlement narrates something else: `cmd/codeaf/do.go`,
`w.produced.list()`, the errand's own registry, which every leaf in the job feeds
as it lands and which is filtered against the disk when it is read.

Two records, and a repair round is exactly where they diverge. A repair is a new
node; it writes nothing new, because the work already landed under its parent.
So the gate that judges it is handed an EMPTY record and told the run was
observed from beginning to end, and `Evidence.namedBlock` prints, of a file that
is on disk:

> `examples/rich_log_follow_state.py — nothing of that name is among what was left behind`

textual s5, `task-2-x3`, is that sentence coming back out of the judge as the
finding it refused the delivery on — while the run's own `--json` artifact list,
printed forty lines later out of the OTHER record, names
`/app/examples/rich_log_follow_state.py`. igel s5 `task-2-x1` is the same shape
("the record shows that the named files were not produced"). A gate whose record
is narrower than the run's is FAILSAFE clause 2 again, one seam along from where
that clause was first written: the evidence was narrower than the world.

> **WHAT THE RUN LEFT BEHIND IS ONE RECORD, HELD BY THE JOB, AND THE GATE READS
> THE SAME ONE THE SETTLEMENT NARRATES.**

`brainOptions.produced` was a write-only sink — the wiring could tell the
registry about a file and could never ask it anything — which is the whole reason
two records existed. It becomes a record with both halves, `add` and `list`, and
`gateEvidence` is handed the job's list unioned with the leaf's own. Path
identity is `namedAs`, which already answers a relative spelling against an
absolute path by suffix, so a deliverable that writes `examples/rich_log_follow_state.py`
and a record that holds `/app/examples/rich_log_follow_state.py` are one file and
never a contradiction. Nothing here is compared by string equality on whatever
spelling the deliverable happened to use.

## 6. Prose in the deliverable is not the world

`internal/revision/judge.go`, `AdmitGapPresent`. It reads an ENUMERATION out of
the citation — three or more items, by shape — and acquits the delivery when
every one of those items appears somewhere in the delivered text, case-folded.
`cmd/codeaf/chat.go` then sets `store.DeliveryGate.Overturned`, whose own comment
says the field means the refusal was CHECKED AGAINST THE WORLD.

It was not. The citation is a span of the REQUEST; the text it is checked against
is the deliverable's own account of itself. A worker that restates the request
back in the request's words satisfies it by writing prose, which is what textual
s5 did:

> `gate: refused — The deliverable reports that examples/rich_log_follow_state.py
> exists and is committed, but the run record shows nothing of that name was
> produced … — everything it names is already in the delivered text, in the words
> the request used`

The finding was true, the acquittal was decided by the deliverable, and the run
left with exit 0 at 1 of 20 hidden checks. This is FAILSAFE clause 2 broken in
the strict sense the clause states it: the evidence was sourced FROM THE
COMPONENT BEING CHECKED.

> **A FINDING IS OVERTURNED ONLY BY THE WORLD — a file on disk, a check green in
> a reading, an artifact in the record. The delivered text can overturn a finding
> only when the delivered text IS the whole of what the run left behind.**

That last clause is not a softening; it is the same rule. A question answered in
prose produces nothing but the message, so the message is the artifact and a
citation settled against it is settled against everything the run made. That is
the measured case this door was built for — twelve profiles asked for by name,
twelve profiles in the message, and a gate reporting the twelve were absent — and
it is preserved exactly. The moment the run left a file behind, the record is the
world and the text is a claim about it, so the text settles nothing:
`AdmitGapPresent` is asked for the record and returns no acquittal when the
record holds anything.

The anti-runaway half is untouched. A finding must still be grounded in the
request, the working method or the plan's own promises (`Grounds`,
`citationGrounded`), and a provenance refusal still leaves the finding STANDING
and the run partial, exactly as §2 built it. Refusing to buy a round and
acquitting the work were never the same act; §2 separated them and this keeps
them separate at the other door.

## 7. One reading of "whole", and the person reads it

`cmd/codeaf/do.go`. `deliveredWhole` computed the settled verdict as
`Pass || PolishClosed || Overturned`; `gateWords`, forty lines away, computed the
line the person watching reads from `Pass` and `Refused` alone. Two readers, two
contracts, and on three of five s5 runs they disagreed out loud: ink and ofetch
printed

```
gate: fail — The deliverable is a listing of files, not the answer itself …
```

as the last thing the person saw, and left with exit 0. The event carries both a
first verdict and a repair's, and `gateWords` was only ever shown the first.

> **THE SETTLED VERDICT IS ONE FIELD-READING, AND EVERY READER USES IT.**

`store.DeliveryGate.Whole` is that reading, on the event, beside the fields it
combines. `deliveredWhole` is `!gate.Whole()` and `gateWords` says `pass` for a
gate a repair closed. What `PolishClosed` means is unchanged and is worth stating
plainly, because it is the one branch here that is not a defect: it is set only
from a SECOND full `JudgeDeliverable` that answered pass, and that judgement
re-runs the whole world half first — regressions, vanished checks, promised files
against the disk, and its own reading of the final tree. A repair that closed the
gap is a world-checked pass and settles whole. What was wrong was the sentence
the person read on the way out, not the code.

And the run says why it was short, once, last, in the register the stream already
uses:

```
partial — gate: <the finding> (not repaired: <the reason nothing more ran>)
```

FAILSAFE clause 3: a fail-safe that does not reach the person watching is
decoration, and an exit code nobody sees is the quietest decoration there is.

## 8. A repair that moved nothing may not close a finding about the world

§7 left `PolishClosed` alone on the grounds that it is set only from a second
full `JudgeDeliverable` that answered pass, and that judgement re-runs the whole
world half first. Both halves of that are true and the conclusion was still
wrong, because of what the repair in front of it had been.

A failed gate buys one repair and there are two kinds. One re-runs the worker: it
can edit files, run checks, and change what the world says. The other —
`revision.Compose`, taken whenever `Composable` holds, which is every change
worker whose change already landed — rewrites the ACCOUNT of the work and runs
nothing at all. Its own comment says so: *"the outcome is kept, not replaced …
the composition did none of it; only the words are new."*

So the second gate reads a better-written summary of the identical world the
first gate failed. ink s5 and ofetch s5 are both that:

| run | what the first reading said was missing | what the repair did | settled |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ink s5 `task-2` | "the substance of the work: the implemented code, the branch created, and the confirmation that it compiles" | composed a summary | whole, 7 of 25 |
| ofetch s5 `task-2-x1` | "the test results and the confirmation that `pnpm test` exits 0" | composed a summary | whole, 44 of 47 |

ofetch's own FIRST gate had already journaled what the world said —
"the project's own verification (`pnpm test`) exited 1 and named 0 checks" — and
a sentence cannot make a suite exit 0.

> **A REPAIR THAT PROVABLY DID NOT MOVE THE TREE MAY NOT CLOSE A FINDING WHOSE
> GROUND IS THE TREE OR A READING. It may still close a finding whose only ground
> is the delivered text, because writing is what closes that one.**

Both halves are measured, not asserted.

**Did the tree move?** `revision.TreeStamp` over the job's artifact record —
path, size, modification time, folded to a digest — taken as the finding is
raised and again at the re-judgement. Two equal stamps are a round that changed
nothing, which a composition is by construction and an engine re-run that edited
no file is in fact. It is size-and-mtime rather than content because that is the
question every build system in existence answers this way, and content-hashing a
repository's build output would buy the same answer for megabytes. The fact is
journaled as `store.DeliveryGate.Unmoved`, for the reason `Unclosed` and
`Overturned` are journaled: a settlement that turns on it cannot read it out of a
sentence.

**Is the finding's ground the world?** `revision.GroundedInTheWorld`, four doors,
every one of them reading the record rather than a list of words:

1. The gate already settled it against the world — `Mechanical` (the disk) or
   `Sourced` (a measurement). Neither has an opinion in it.
2. It names a file, by `NamedFiles`' own shape rule.
3. It names a command the RECORD says the run ran, or the verification
   entrypoint. Matched as whole strings, not as symbols, and deliberately: a
   command is usually plain words with a space in it — `pnpm test`, `make check`,
   `go test ./...` — which `symbolShaped` rightly refuses to call a
   distinctively-spelled name. Nothing is inferred from prose, because the string
   being matched is one the record supplied. This is the door ofetch trips.
4. **The run left a tree behind and nothing says the tree is good.** This is the
   door that carries the weight and it is written on the fail-safe side. A run
   that produced files was doing work, not writing an answer; a finding against
   it is a finding about that work unless the world says otherwise, and the only
   thing that can say otherwise is the project's own checks, run on the tree
   being handed over, coming back green. A red reading is the world convicting;
   an ABSENT reading is nobody having looked, and NOBODY LOOKED IS NOT NOTHING
   WRONG — the same rule `DeliveryGate.Unmeasured` already writes down one seam
   along. This is the door ink trips.

What stays false — a finding a rewritten account may honestly close — is
therefore the two cases where writing IS the work. A run that left nothing but
its message: the message is the artifact, which is §6's line reused rather than a
second rule, and the twelve-profiles case goes on closing exactly as it did. And
a run whose change the project's own checks PASS, where what is wrong is the
account of it: happy-dom s4's "the deliverable is a list of file paths, not the
implementation itself", over a green suite, is precisely what `Compose` was built
for and it still closes.

The rule is one function, `revision.RepairClosed`, because it had been an
expression at a wiring seam where it was not visible enough to be got wrong.
A repair whose pass does not count falls through to `ExtendForGap` exactly as a
failed one does — so the run tries to BUY the work that closes the finding rather
than settling — and if nothing can be bought it ends partial, with the reason
named on the last line: `(not repaired: the repair rewrote the account and
changed nothing on disk)`.

## What is deliberately not here

No new judge call, no new clock, no new model round: the stamp is a `stat` per
recorded path and the classification is string shape over strings the record
already holds. No knowledge anywhere of what a test framework is called. And no
rule that a composed repair is worthless — it improves the account that ships in
every case, and it still closes the gate in the two where the account was the
only thing wrong.

## Addendum, 2026-08-29: the photograph had no memory

§4 above built a photograph with a before half and an after half, and the bare
worker took both. What it could not do is see across a repair round.

Every round is a new leaf holding a new workspace object, so every round
photographed the tree IT found — which, from the second round on, is a tree the
job has already changed. A check the first round turned red is red in the second
round's baseline, subtracts to nothing, and is never a finding again. textual s5
walked twenty of the repository's own checks down to one across four rounds and
raised no regression at any of them.

> **THE BASELINE IS THE TREE BEFORE THE JOB'S FIRST CHANGE, TAKEN ONCE AND
> INHERITED BY EVERY CONTINUATION.** Every round's after reading is subtracted
> from that one.

`verify.BaselineFor` / `verify.RememberBaseline`. It is remembered against the
tree's own path, because that is what the baseline is a reading of, and against
the job — a digest of the person's own request, the one thing every leaf of a job
holds identically and no two jobs share — because a second job in the same
directory is measuring different work, and the first job's changes are its
world. A job arriving at a root somebody else's job baselined re-baselines it.

Two consequences beyond the finding. The second reading is now owed whenever the
JOB has moved the tree, not only when this leaf did — a continuation that only
rewrote its account still hands over a tree an earlier round may have broken. And
a repair round runs the suite once rather than twice, because the baseline it
would have spent an eighth of its wall on is one it already has.

And the readings are journaled (`store.EventVerification`). Not one of the five
s5 stores holds a row saying a reading had happened, so a project that declares
no verification and a reading that ran and named nothing were the same silence in
the journal — the two opposite diagnoses. FAILSAFE clause 4, which this document
quoted and did not obey.

## Addendum, 2026-08-29: §6 asked one step earlier

§6 settled that the delivered text may overturn a finding ONLY where the text is
the whole of what the run left behind. It left the same question unasked one seam
earlier — what the judge is HANDED as the deliverable in the first place — and
the answer there was still "the worker's message, always".

textual n1 on nemotron is what that cost: three gates in a row refused a job for
what the message was (`the fenced text … contains only {"contract": "..."}`)
while 42KB of changed Python sat in the worktree and the artifact record named
every file of it. The judge convicted a sentence and never saw the tree.

> **THE DELIVERABLE OF A REQUEST THAT CHANGED THE TREE IS THE TREE. The worker's
> final message is its CLAIM about that change, and a claim is read beside the
> thing it is about, never in place of it.**

`revision.Evidence.Subject` decides it from the artifact record settled against
the disk — the same record `completeAgainstTheWorld` already produces — so the
rule is §6's rule with §6's evidence, and a run that left nothing behind is
judged on its message exactly as it always was. The fence then carries the
changed sources and checks with bounded excerpts, the message sits below it under
a heading that names it a claim, and a refusal must name one file of the record
and quote the behaviour it fails or it is not a verdict this gate can read.
FAILSAFE.md's seventeenth chapter has the whole of it, including why the second
half is a schema and not a sentence.

## Addendum, 2026-08-29: the third reading of the same tree

§4 settled that a regression is a blocker and that its evidence comes from the
world. The addendum above it added the half a suite cannot make — a public name
that was there before the work and is not there now. Both compare a repository
to itself and both are answered by a difference: a check that flipped, a name
that vanished.

igel s12 is the case neither of them can reach. The run rebound `configs` from a
dict to an instance of a class it wrote; the suite stayed green, the names
compared eight and lost none, and the twenty-four hidden tests failed on
`'Configs' object does not support item assignment`. **A retained name whose
definition was rewritten is not a difference either reading can see.**

> **A NAME IS NOT A CONTRACT. A definition whose declaration this run's own diff
> rewrote, and the places the rest of the project still uses that name, are one
> fact and the judge is handed both.**

`verify.ChangedDefinitions` and `verify.Consumers`, read from the JOB's own
baseline and the finished tree with no model in the loop, sampled into the gate's
prompt on a share of its own so a consumer list can never be the reason a changed
file went unprinted. Both readings — this and the lost-names half above — are
re-taken by the gate against the job's baseline rather than carried up from the
leaf that measured them: a grown subtree does its work in children and is judged
at the parent, and igel s14 shipped an ImportError into all 24 hidden tests while
three of its leaves had each journaled the loss.
The verdict schema admits a refusal grounded on a consumer's own file and line
beside one grounded on a behaviour of the request — §6's rule is unchanged for
behaviours, and this is a second ground rather than a loosening of that one,
because no behaviour of any request will ever say "and it must still support
item assignment". Such a refusal is Sourced, buys the repair round every measured
finding buys, and is journaled as a finding of its own. FAILSAFE.md's twentieth
chapter has the whole of it, including what it does not promise.


## Addendum, 2026-08-29: what a contract may not cost

§6 and the seventeenth chapter made a finding about the fenced text unsayable by
building an enum. igel s15 is the other edge of that: the judge named
`feature_schema.joblib`, a file the request asks for and the disk does not hold,
the enum did not contain it, and the run ended after eight minutes with
`the review could not be read` and nothing started.

> **A contract narrows what a verdict may SAY. It may never be the reason a run
> ends with nothing done about a finding the world can settle by itself.**

Two halves. The `file` enum admits everything the plan or the person PROMISED
beside the record and the consumers, because an absent deliverable is in no
record by definition — and such a refusal is the mechanical gap, marked and
funded as one. And when no verdict can be read at all, the gate runs that same
promised-versus-present check and raises what the filesystem says, journaled
`subject: fallback`. What it does NOT do is re-ask under the claim contract: that
was built and it re-admitted the three findings §6 exists to refuse.


## Addendum, 2026-09-02: a tree with no diff has nothing to judge and nothing to repair

§8 established that a repair round which moved nothing may not close a finding
about the world, and it did it by stamping the tree either side of the round. The
same stamp, taken either side of the LEAF, answers a question one step earlier
and cheaper: was there ever anything here to judge at all?

The run that made it necessary read a large file to its budget twice over. Its
growth governor declared a standstill — the sentence went to the stream and the
journal — and the settlement then paid two gate calls of ~114K tokens whose
refusal described work that did not exist, ran a full twenty-turn repair round
against that refusal, re-judged it, printed the standstill again, and resumed the
same leaf a third time. Every one of those was bought over a tree that was
byte-for-byte the tree the leaf had started from.

> **ONCE THE HARNESS HAS CONCLUDED NOTHING IS CHANGING, IT STOPS SPENDING ON
> THAT JOB: no gate on a tree with no diff, no repair round on a tree with no
> diff, and no resume.**

Three parts, one law. The gate and the repair are skipped on the MEASUREMENT —
the record stamped as the leaf started against the same record where the gate
would be asked — because a leaf that wrote and altered nothing has produced
nothing for a judge to read and nothing for a repair to build on. The resume is
stopped on the VERDICT: the growth governor's cause word rides out on the leaf's
result (`resident.ExecResult.RefusedGrowth`) and the scheduler ends the node with
the governor's own sentence rather than claiming it again. The two are separate
readings on purpose — a job can be at a standstill while a leaf writes scratch,
and a leaf can change nothing on a round nobody has refused yet — and the first
fruitless round is bought by both, because the governor already encodes that
clause (FAILSAFE clause 5) and nothing here re-derives it.

An unasked gate is journaled as what it was. The row carries the handover
sentence in `refused` and leaves the delivery `unclosed`, and it never carries a
pass: a run that changed nothing handed over less than it promised, and the
ledger a battery reads must not be able to mistake it for work that was checked.

The sibling ruling, at the same seam: **a delivery gate that PASSED settles the
node, even where the leaf ran out of room getting there.** Running out is a
statement about the meter; a gate pass is a reading of the work against the words
the person used, and "is this done" is the work's question. What is still refused
is the one that produced the defect this document is named after — a remainder
judge shown the brief and the worker's own last sentence, whose "nothing is left"
settles nothing at all.

## Addendum, 2026-09-02: a constraint the person states is a law of the run

Every clause above weighs what the work PRODUCED. #427 is the other axis, and
nothing in this file held it: a rule the person states about what the run may or
may not **do**.

The measured run is one sentence long.

> Run the command `go test ./internal/subharness/ -count=1` in this workspace and
> report the final line it prints. **Change no files.**

The first leaf did exactly that — one shell call, the final line reported, its
own closing words "No files were changed." — and two minutes in the request was
satisfied. The run then spliced `write-run-command-test`,
`check-runs-in-workspace`, `check-reports-final-line`, which wrote a new test
into an existing `_test.go` and a shell script at the workspace root. Measured
twice on the shipped default: 1 file changed, then 2.

The constraint reached the run only as prose. The compiled brief had no field for
one, so "Change no files" survived inside the goal and inside the working method.
The acceptance checklist rightly held two behaviours about the RESULT (the
command is run; the final line is reported) and — also rightly — did not hold the
constraint, because it is not a behaviour of the deliverable. So nothing
structural carried it, and the gate never read it: the judge is asked to name an
element of the request that is ABSENT, and the workspace's own before-and-after
list was never held against a rule about what the run may not touch.

Three rules then rewarded the violation, which is why no prompt could have fixed
it. A repair was judged not to have closed a grounded finding when it "changed
nothing on disk". The growth governor's standstill reads "nothing was written or
altered" as no progress. And the overrun journal recorded the two written files
under `moved` as the evidence that the round had produced something.

> **A CONSTRAINT THE PERSON STATES IS A LAW OF THE RUN: carried on the brief and
> on the spec of EVERY node, shown to every worker first, held mechanically at
> the gate against what the run left behind, and never advice. A delivery that
> broke one FAILS, and a broken constraint NEVER buys a repair round or a
> remainder.**

Four things follow, and each is a mechanism rather than a sentence.

**It is a field.** `plan.Constraint` carries the person's own words, the
mechanical reading of them (`no_writes`, `paths_only`, `other`) and the paths
that reading is about. The compiler extracts it; `head.keepStatedConstraints`
then drops every constraint whose text it cannot quote out of the instruction,
because THE GATE MAY ONLY HOLD PEOPLE TO THEIR OWN WORDS — a rule this system
invented, enforced by arithmetic, would fail deliveries that did exactly what was
asked. The same guard strips a kept rule out of `Assumptions`, since `codeaf do`
discards those and a rule living only there is a rule that surface drops.

**It lands on every node, not on the one that delivers.** That is the one way
`SetConstraints` differs from `SetAcceptance` beside it. The checklist is what
the finished thing must do and belongs to whoever hands it over; the person said
"change no files" about the RUN, so every worker the run starts is under it —
including the ones spliced later, which is exactly where the files were written.
The remainder planner stamps them onto the continuation before it is encoded.

**The gate holds it before a model is bought, and above every other finding.**
`revision.HoldConstraints` reads the artifact record against the workspace: for
`no_writes`, any file the run left behind; for `paths_only`, any file outside the
named places. The harness's own machinery is never counted — it lives outside the
workspace root by construction, and `verify.SkipTree` names the rest. The
resulting judgement is `Mechanical` and `Sourced`: mechanical because no ruling
about a quotation makes a written file unwritten, and sourced because the quote
IS the person's sentence, so the grounding invariant of §1 is satisfied by
construction rather than by a check. `other` constraints are shown to the judge
as the standard beside the request instead.

**And it buys nothing.** `ExtendForGap` refuses before anything is planned —
`the work broke a rule the person set, and no round is bought to close that` —
and the repair round is skipped at the wiring seam for the same reason. §8's
standstill rule is turned OFF for a run under `no_writes`: a run told to change
nothing that changed nothing has kept its word, and reading that as a repair
which did nothing is the first of the three rules above, written down.

`store.DeliveryGate.Constraint` records it, and `Whole()` counts it as leaving
the delivery short — no pass, no closed repair and no overturned refusal covers
it, because none of the three is about the rule.

Four edges of the same law, each one a place it could have leaked out.

**A claim-time child is minted inside its parent's spec.** An expansion inherits
the graph's own premises — the settled points, the terrain, the invoice — and
inherited NOTHING off the node it divided, so a divided node lost its criterion,
its working method and its rules in one silent step. `plan.Graph.mintedInside`
takes the parent's whole spec at the single seam every minted child passes
through: Done and Method fill what the sub-plan left empty and never overwrite
what it wrote, Constraints go on every child, and Accept answers to
`deliverableOwner` as it always has, because stamping the checklist on every sink
buys one repair round per sink for one gap.

**A rule the JUDGE convicts on is a broken rule.** The rules no arithmetic can
settle are shown to the judge as the standard beside the request, and a verdict
that quotes one was right about the finding and had no way to say what KIND of
finding it is — so it bought the repair round and the remainder like any other
gap. `ConstraintQuoted` stamps it at the gate's one exit, on the containment rule
this program already uses for a behaviour, and only for `other`: a mechanical
rule was held above and found KEPT, so a judge convicting on one is convicting on
an answered question.

**The `no_writes` neutrality is not an amnesty.** It makes an unmoved repair
neutral about findings only work could close, which is what a run under that rule
needs. It does not cover a MECHANICAL gap — a file the plan or the person
promised and the disk does not hold — because no rule about what a run may not
write makes an absent deliverable appear, and without the guard one rule on the
record would switch §8 off for everything.

**Deleting is changing, and containment is lexical.** The reading that holds the
rule is the only one in this package that must not ask the disk whether a file
still exists: a run told to change nothing that DELETED a file changed the tree in
the loudest way there is, and a dangling symlink is the same event wearing a stat
error. A workspace reached through a symlink is not resolved — that is how the
artifact record spells its paths, and two spellings of one place is drift this
reading cannot afford. Only a real climb out of the root (`..`, `../…`) is
outside it; `..config` at the root of somebody's tree is a file they keep there.

## Addendum, 2026-09-02: a run ends when the request is satisfied

Everything above bounds a run negatively — rounds spent, nodes spliced, dollars
burned, wall left, findings standing. Nothing in it ever asked whether the thing
the person asked for is in hand. The headless door settles when every node is
terminal; the growth governor judges the PLAN's own criterion; the gate names
absences against a checklist. **"Done" was when the plan ran out.**

The measured cost is #428: an errand satisfied by its first leaf at two minutes
ran into its 700-second wall twice out of two, and a correct fix to a real issue
was refused three times and delivered as `partial` over tests that were 6 of 6
green.

### The question, and the one place it is asked

`revision.RequestMet` (internal/revision/satisfied.go). One model call on the
gate's own client, with a static system prompt first for the cache: the verbatim
request, the rules the person stated, the deliverable as produced, and the record
of what the run changed. It answers `{"met": bool, "missing": "<quoted words>"}`
against a schema.

**It is asked at the moment a round would otherwise be bought, and nowhere
else** — never per turn, never on the happy path — so its cost is bounded by the
rounds it replaces. There are three seams:

- `cmd/codeaf/chat.go`, `requestSettled`, after both world-doors and before the
  repair round. A yes sets `gate.Pass`, clears the gap, stamps
  `revision.RequestMetWords` on the verdict, on `store.DeliveryGate.Receipt` and
  on the node's own record. Every reader downstream turns on `gate.Pass`, so no
  repair, no remainder, no continuation and no reservation follow.
- The same call on the judgement the REPAIR produced, before the extension. A
  repair round rewrites the deliverable and is judged again, so that is a
  different verdict over a different text and the answer may have changed with
  it; without asking, the run buys a whole remainder over a request the repair
  had just satisfied.
- `revision.ExtendForGap`, before `ReplanOverrunAs`, through `metExtension`, for
  the callers that reach the extension without the gate's own caller. The
  resident's resume path is a fourth door and is not wired here.

`Judgment.RequestAsked` carries the answer between them, so one verdict is never
paid for twice. `Judgment.Request` is the question itself, bound at
`JudgeDeliverable`'s single exit beside `Subject` and `HeldPoint` and for the
identical reason: **a field set by the caller is a field the next caller
forgets**, and until it was bound there the extension door was dead wiring for
every caller that is not the chat surface.

### A MODEL'S READING MAY NOT OVERTURN A MEASUREMENT

`revision.MeasuredFinding`, and it is the law this door lives or dies by. The
question is one model looking at a deliverable and a record. A file the plan
promised and the disk does not hold, a check that passed before the work and
fails after it, a name the tree no longer binds, a behaviour nothing exercises,
a definition its callers no longer fit — each is a fact somebody gathered, and no
reading of the request is competent to overturn one. The two world-doors above
this are allowed to acquit only because they weigh a finding against the disk and
against the delivered text; this weighs it against a sentence, so it may be put
ONLY of the judge's own prose — "that is a report about the output, not the
output itself" — which is a reading of the request and is answerable by another
reading of the request. Without the restriction the door would do exactly what
§2 spent a whole sweep making impossible.

`revision.RequestQuestionable` is the one predicate both doors read, so neither
can spell half the law. `revision.ConstraintFinding` is its other half and the
one-line seam for constraints — a run that produced everything the request asked
for in a way the request forbade has not met the request as stated.

### The fail-open direction is the existing path

`asked` is false wherever there was no answer to read — no client, a call that
failed, a reply that could not be parsed — and the caller then buys the round it
was going to buy. A yes that also names something missing is read as a no. The
alternative to both is a delivery ended as satisfied on the strength of a
provider timeout.

### A receipt says why a run stopped, never whether it landed

`store.DeliveryGate.Receipt` is the one positive field on that row and it is
deliberately **not** read by `Whole()`. Two sentences, each stated once:
`revision.RequestMetWords` — *the request was met as stated* — and
`revision.CheckedNotMeasured` — *checked by tests, coverage not measured*, which
a delivery earns where the coverage question had no measurement to answer from
and the work's own checks ran and every one of them settled
(`revision.checkedByItsOwnTests`). The second also clears `Unreadable`, because a
run whose own checks ran and settled is not a run nothing checked — a person is
never shown `partial` over green work, and never a silent pass either: the
receipt says which of the two happened. The fallback reads the worker's
STRUCTURED account and never the deliverable's prose about its own tests.

---

## Addendum, 2026-09-04: a leaf is judged on the job's tree, not on its own hands

The wire settlement's guard read the failed leaf's own artifact list, while the
gate beneath it read the job's merged artifact record. A repair or resumed leaf
can write nothing itself over a file an earlier attempt already landed, so the
guard could decline the settlement before the gate saw the work it was meant to
judge.

`settledOnTheTree` now assembles `jobArtifacts(record, artifacts)` once. That one
list decides whether anything landed, forms the `Files:` block in the delivery,
and becomes the evidence held by the gate. This deliberately widens settlement
to every wire-failed leaf whose job record still names a file on disk, whether or
not that leaf wrote one itself; a job that left nothing anywhere still buys no
gate call.
