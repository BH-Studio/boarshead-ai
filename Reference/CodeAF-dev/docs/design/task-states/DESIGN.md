# Task states — three tiers, one question

Owner ruling 2026-09-09. This is the contract every lane in the task-states wave
builds to, and this file is the copy of record: the engine lane landed the words
and the Go names below, and every surface lane reads them from here.

## The question the surface answers

Every task row, card, rail line and roster entry answers ONE question before it
says anything else: **do I need to do anything?** There are exactly three
answers, and each has one glyph and one word.

| Tier | Slot (internal/tui2/tokens) | Plain · nerd-font · ASCII | Word on the row | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| moving | `GQueued` · `GWaitsOn` · `GWorking` | `○` nf-fa-circle_o `o` · `⚑` nf-fa-flag `!` · `◐` nf-fa-adjust `*` | queued · working · waiting on … · auto-starts in … · finishing | nothing for you |
| over | `GSettled` · `GStopped` · `GFailed` | `✓` nf-fa-check `+` · `■` nf-fa-stop `/` · `✕` nf-fa-times `x` | done · stopped · incomplete | nothing for you; a rerun may be offered |
| your call | `GNeedsHuman` | `?` nf-fa-question_circle_o `?` | your call | the machine has done what it can; the card carries the reason and the answers |

The fuel gate keeps its prefix rule exactly as today (taskstrip.go): a gated
node wears `GPaused` — `=`, nf-fa-pause, `=` — in front of the tier glyph. The
media-control `⏸` it used to draw is BANNED by `tokens.BannedGlyphs`.

**No mark is a character any surface spells.** Every one is a slot resolved
through `tokens.GlyphSet.Glyph(id)`, and which tier a terminal is on is decided
once (`app.iconSet`). The waiting flag is new to this table: a row held behind
task 4 or behind a busy machine used to wear the queued circle, and it is not
queued — it is blocked, which is a different answer to "is anything happening?".
docs/design/icons/DESIGN.md is the vocabulary's own page.

Rules that hold everywhere:

- **The glyph is the tier and nothing else.** A person who learns three glyphs
  has learned the whole system.
- **The reason is on the row, in a plain sentence, never a machine word.** A row
  never reads a bare `waiting` or a bare `your call`: it reads `waiting on task
  4`, `your call · conflicts with your branch`.
- **One word per state across every surface.** Card head, rail, roster, home,
  the landing note the model reads, the `tasks` tool's reply. These words are
  DELETED as person-facing text: `awaiting review`, `unverified`, `needs your
  look`, `failed`, `delivery needs attention`, `what it produced was not taken
  as done`, `stopped — branch kept` (the branch is a fact line, below).
- **The emptiness law holds.** Unknown renders as nothing.
- **Banned machinery vocabulary stays banned:** auditor, verdict, verified,
  refuted, unverified, reaudit.

## The states

### moving

| Row reads | Backend |
| --- | --- |
| `queued` | TaskQueued, no wait |
| `waiting on task 4` | TaskQueued with Waits, or running with Hold |
| `auto-starts in 9s` | consent clock running (today's `taskAutoWord`) |
| `working · <phase caption>` | TaskRunning |
| `finishing · <gap>` | TaskRunning in checking/repairing |

### over

| Row reads | Backend | Optional verb |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `done` | TaskDone | none |
| `stopped` | ending stopped by the person | `rerun` if the branch has work |
| `incomplete · <reason>` | TaskFailed, any ending | `rerun from its branch` where a rerun can help |

`failed` is gone. The engine's TaskFailed keeps its name internally; the person
reads `incomplete` plus one of these reasons, spelled once in
`internal/session` and read by every surface:

| Ending | Reason sentence |
| --- | --- |
| wire | lost the connection |
| upstream | the model provider refused it |
| circling | went in circles |
| blocked | was blocked by another task |
| steps | ran out of steps |
| notes | would not write its notes down |
| stale | its brief went stale |
| refused | would not take a step it was asked to |
| error, or no reason | a fault: <first line of the error> |
| check named gaps (incomplete lead) | the check found gaps: <gaps> |

`Fault` (task_status.go) stays true only for error and unknown endings; a
faulted row may be coloured bad, every other incomplete row is dim.

A `done` row carries the merge as a FACT LINE, not a state: `merged`,
`branch kept`, or nothing for in-place work.

**`branch kept` appears whenever the landing kept the branch, and asking for it
is only one of the four ways that happens.** The other three are the landing
refusing a destination it must not write (`keptLandingSentence`,
internal/session/task_branch_protection.go): the checkout is on a protected
name — `main`, `master`, `dev`, `staging`, `trunk`, `production`, `release` and
the rest of that one list, plus whatever a remote calls its default — the
checkout is not on a branch at all, or the branch has moved since the work was
cut and the movement was not codeaf's own. Every one of those is the engine
behaving, and the card's own report says WHICH: `its branch task/parser was
kept: your checkout is on main, which tasks do not merge into automatically`.

This is worth knowing before you write a test: on the repository a fresh
checkout gives you, an ordinary `/task` landing keeps its branch and never
merges, so nothing a person does in that checkout can clash with anything. A
fixture that wants the conflict shape moves off the trunk first, and leaves its
clashing change UNCOMMITTED — committing moves the branch, which is the fourth
reason above (`internal/e2e`'s `testStatesConflict`).

### your call

One word, one glyph, and the reason plus the answers on the card. The reasons
are a closed set, each with its yes verb and its no verb. The card's chips are
ALWAYS the same three columns in the same order with the same keys:

```
[a] <yes verb> · [n] <no verb> · [s] tell it
```

| Reason (row sentence) | Backend | `a` yes verb | `n` no verb |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| starts on your word | consent card before the run (`taskWaitingWord` today) | start | don't |
| design ready to approve | harness asking | approve | decline |
| conflicts with your branch: <files> | merge conflicted after the merge round failed | resolve it (spends one more merge round) | drop it (refute; branch kept) |
| your branch changed the same files while it worked: <files> | the ground moved under work that HELD its check (`TaskFacts.Shifted`) | resolve it (spends one more merge round) | drop it (refute; branch kept) |
| nobody could check it | TaskUnverified, checker gave no answer after failover | accept | not right |
| the check ran out of time | TaskUnverified, the clock cut the checker's last call or closed its window (`auditVerdict.ranOut`) | accept | not right |
| the check did not pass it: <gaps> | ResultHeld / held landing | accept anyway | not right |
| paused at the <cap> cap | fuel gate | raise the cap | stop it |

**Two roads reach the conflict row, and the ask kind stays one.** A branch that
would not fasten and a ground that moved under one that would are the same
shape — two versions of the same files, one on the task's branch and one on
yours — so they close with the same two answers, and only the sentence differs.
The fact that decides which sentence is `TaskFacts.Shifted`, never the prose:
the shifted landing keeps the merge word `kept`, because its branch WOULD have
merged and its check DID pass. It used to fall through to `nobody could check
it`, which was false in both halves.

`[s] tell it` is the third column on every card. It puts the composer into the
existing steer mode (steer.go, `glyphSteer`) addressed to that task, the
composer shows the address as a chip, and what is typed is sent as a steer. **A
steer never resolves a task by itself.** The model or a worker reads it and
spends the verb. "Looks good" typed on a card must not silently become accept.

`check again` / reaudit is no longer offered to the person. The engine retries
the check itself (below). The engine verb stays for the model.

`decide these for me` leaves the answer row. It was a persistent preference
disguised as an answer and it is why the owner found a card with no choices and
no explanation. In its place:

- a one-time `[d] let codeaf decide this one` drawn dimmer than the three
  columns, which hands THIS card to the model and changes no setting;
- the standing `task.settle` setting lives in `/settings` only.

### the auto-settle floor

`task.settle = auto` stays. When it is the reason a card has no chips, the card
must say so on the reason line: `nobody could check it · codeaf is deciding ·
[t] take it back`. Pressing `t` draws the chips and resolves nothing.

**A task never stays unowned past the end of a turn.** If the model's turn ends
and a task it was handed is still unsettled, the engine publishes that the
decision is back with the person and the card draws its chips. If the model's
last message asked the person a question about that task, the chips are the
answer surface for that question: model text above, chips below, one ask.

**And a process ending is the end of every turn it was holding.** Who is
deciding rides the checkpoint (`taskRecord.Decider`, task_store.go) with the
emptiness law — a record that says nothing says the person — so a graph coming
off the disk carries the fact rather than losing it. The floor then fires on the
way in: **every node the record says the model was holding is handed to the
person as the checkpoint is read** (`TaskGraph.handBackOnLoad`, out of
`rehydrate`), before the frontier turns, before anything is drawn, and before
the checkpoint is rewritten, so the file stops saying it too. That covers the
restart, the re-attach and the engine that died mid-turn, and it is what makes
the shape testable at all: a fixture can now seed a card codeaf was deciding,
which is why the acceptance could not provoke this shape before.

`readsTheDecisionLocked`'s question — is this the turn the decision was handed
into — is not asked on that road. There are no turns on it; every agent that was
holding anything died with the process.

**The project index deliberately does not carry the decider.** That file is what
work *came to*, appended once and never rewritten, and who holds a question
lasts at most one turn — a row on disk saying `codeaf is deciding` about a
conversation that closed hours ago is a claim nothing can correct. It is
`TaskIndexEntry.Activity`'s rule about a present that ends seconds after it is
recorded, said about a second momentary fact.

**One holder, and the questions wave reads it.** A landed `your call` reaches
`internal/session/question.go` as a derived `Question`, and its `Policy` is read
off `TaskAsk.Owner` (`landingPolicy`): the model holding it is `PolicyDecide`,
the person is `PolicyAsk`. There is no second holder and **no second timer** —
`PolicyRecommendThenAuto` and its deadline belong to the `ask` tool's own timed
assumptions (`tools_ask.go`), while the floor is the end of a turn rather than a
clock.

Conflicts are never handed to the model. It cannot merge by decree, and a
ground that moved is the same refusal: the note says `their own branch changed
the same files while this worked, and that is not yours to accept`.

## What the engine tries before anything is your call

Each of these is one automatic attempt, logged in the task's journal, then the
ordinary landing:

1. **Checker failover.** A check that never answers or answers with neither
   word is retried once through the provider failover ladder on another model
   before the node lands as `nobody could check it`.

   **Before that, a checker that read something is asked for its word (#941).**
   Until 2026-09-11 a checker whose call was cut by its share of the window was
   closed with everything it had read, and a fresh one began the investigation
   again inside what was left; on a reasoning model with nothing to run (a
   one-minute window, thirty seconds a call) both were cut mid-thought and
   correct work landed `your call`. Now every checker call goes out under a
   window it is TOLD (`internal/session/callwindow.go`: the one client door
   hands the time left to the adapter, which derives the thinking allowance from
   it and the lane's measured pace, #940's `provider.WithThinkingWall`), its
   calls are planned as `lane.RoleJudge` rather than a leaf's, and a call cut
   after the checker had opened files or run commands is followed by an answer
   ask on the SAME checker — its transcript is the evidence, `auditNudge` is the
   question, its thinking is switched off (`Agent.askForTheWord`, which is also
   the old nudge for a reply that said neither word). Only a checker cut before
   it read anything goes to the fresh-checker rung.

   **And a non-answer the clock decided says so.** It used to read `nobody could
   check it` like every other non-answer, which a person takes as news about the
   work. It is still `your call` — nothing merges on a non-answer — but the row
   reads `the check ran out of time`, and the report leads `the check ran out of
   time — one call ran 30s without answering and was abandoned · the window
   closed before a second`. The reason is read back off that lead
   (`taskCheckReason`), the way the held row reads its gaps, so every surface that
   carries the report comes to the same sentence without a field of its own.
2. **The merge round.** A branch that conflicts gets one resolver round: merge
   the person's branch into the task branch in the task's worktree, a worker
   resolves the markers with the brief and both sides in front of it, the check
   runs again on the result, and the landing is retried. Only a round that fails
   reaches the card, with the files named. The original task branch ref is kept
   under `task/<slug>-before-merge` so nothing is rewritten in place.
3. **One rerun** from the branch for wire, upstream and stale endings, before
   the node lands `incomplete`.

## How the end shows in the chat

The landing card is three rows at most and every row has one job.

```
✓ ◆ Port the parser · done · 6m40s · 2 files · merged · task/parser
  "what it said about the work" · started 14:02 · ctrl+o output
```

```
? ◆ Port the parser · your call · 6m40s · 2 files · branch kept · task/parser
  nobody could check it — the checker never answered
  [a] accept · [n] not right · [s] tell it · [d] let codeaf decide this one
```

```
? ◆ Port the parser · your call · 6m40s · 2 files · branch kept · task/parser
  conflicts with your branch: parser.go, parser_test.go
  [a] resolve it · [n] drop it · [s] tell it
```

```
✗ ◆ Port the parser · incomplete · 4m02s · 1 file · branch kept · task/parser
  ran out of steps · [r] rerun from its branch
```

- Row 1 is the head: tier glyph, kind glyph, title, tier word, then facts in a
  fixed order: span, files, merge fact, branch. Nothing else.
- Row 2 is the reason (accent for your call, dim otherwise) or the quoted
  report for done. Never both on one row; the report is behind `ctrl+o` when a
  reason is showing.
- Row 3 is the chips, only on your call, and only while it is unanswered. An
  answered card replaces row 3 with one dim receipt in the person's voice
  (`you took this as done`, `you said it is not finished`, `sent to be
  resolved`), which already exists in tasksettle.go.
- The head is never rewritten after landing. A later resolution lands as its
  own card, as today.
- No sentence on the card ends in `…` hiding the one instruction the person
  needs. If the reason must be cut, the files list is what gets cut, never the
  verb.

## The rail and the roster

- The rail row is `<tier glyph> <title> · <word or reason>`, cut from the right.
  Your-call rows are ordered first, then moving, then over, which is
  `railGlyphRank`'s order today with the `awaiting review` exception removed.
- A folded family wears its loudest child, as today.
- The roster (`/tasks`, tasksplace.go) and home use the same word constants;
  none of them spells a state locally.

## The model's side

- The landing note (`taskNote`) uses the same tier words and reason sentences.
  It says `task 7 your call: <title>` / `task 7 incomplete: <title>` / `task 7
  done: <title>`. `failed` and `needs your look` leave the note.
- `beltfacts.go` and `prompts/system.md` describe the verbs the model has:
  accept, not right, check again (the engine verb `reaudit`), and steer. They
  say a conflict is never the model's to accept.
- The `tasks` tool's replies use the same words.

## Contract: Go names every lane uses

Owned by the engine lane (E1), read by every surface lane:

```go
// internal/session/task_status.go
type TaskTier string
const (
    TaskTierMoving   TaskTier = "moving"
    TaskTierOver     TaskTier = "over"
    TaskTierYourCall TaskTier = "your-call"
)

type TaskAskKind string
const (
    TaskAskStart    TaskAskKind = "start"     // starts on your word
    TaskAskApprove  TaskAskKind = "approve"   // design ready to approve
    TaskAskConflict TaskAskKind = "conflict"  // conflicts with your branch, OR the ground moved
    TaskAskCheck    TaskAskKind = "check"     // nobody could check it
    TaskAskHeld     TaskAskKind = "held"      // the check did not pass it
    TaskAskCap      TaskAskKind = "cap"       // paused at the cap
)

// TaskAsk is the question on a your-call row: the reason sentence and the two
// closed answers. Yes and No are the person-facing verbs, spelled once here.
type TaskAsk struct {
    Kind   TaskAskKind
    Reason string   // the row sentence, complete, e.g. "conflicts with your branch: a.go, b.go"
                    // or "your branch changed the same files while it worked: a.go, b.go"
    Yes    string   // "accept", "resolve it", "start", "approve", "accept anyway", "raise the cap"
    No     string   // "not right", "drop it", "don't", "decline", "stop it"
    Owner  TaskAskOwner // who holds the decision right now
}

type TaskAskOwner string
const (
    TaskAskOwnerPerson TaskAskOwner = "person"
    TaskAskOwnerModel  TaskAskOwner = "model"   // task.settle=auto handed it over; the floor hands it back
)

// TaskStatus gains:
//   Tier   TaskTier
//   Ask    TaskAsk        // zero unless Tier == TaskTierYourCall
//   Word   string         // the row word: "queued", "working", "done", "incomplete", "your call" …
//   Reason string         // already exists; for incomplete it is the reason sentence above
func TaskReasonOf(ending TaskEnding, report string) string   // the incomplete reason table
func (s TaskStatus) RowWord() string                          // Word, plus " · " + Reason where one exists
```

`ProjectTask` fills Tier, Word and Ask from the facts it already has. Surfaces
read Tier for the glyph, Word/Reason for the row, Ask for the card. No surface
computes a tier from State on its own.

The three resolutions the engine accepts stay `accept`, `reaudit`, `refute`;
the surface maps `a`→accept (or the conflict's merge round), `n`→refute. A new
engine door `ResolveConflict(id)` spends the merge round on demand.

## Gates that will name you

- `internal/e2e/tuiwords_test.go` pins person-facing strings; every respelled
  string must be updated there in the same change.
- `internal/manual/chat/` pages must describe the new words; the probes in
  `internal/manual/chat_test.go` must still reach their pages.
- `internal/tui3/manual_test.go` and `internal/session/manual_test.go` for any
  new key or tool verb.
- Comments are full-sentence prose with ALL-CAPS for a stated law. Match the
  density around you.
