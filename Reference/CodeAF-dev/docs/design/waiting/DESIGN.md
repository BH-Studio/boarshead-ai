# Waiting — nobody waits long, and the build always knows why

*Date: 2026-09-01. Status: design → build. Lives at `docs/design/waiting/DESIGN.md`.
Written against `dev@97724633` and the audit of the three-minute turn that
prompted it. Replaces rows 1–6 of `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` Decision 10's clock
table; the rest of that table is unchanged.*

## The one sentence

Every call this build makes to a model is watched by one controller that, at
every instant, knows how much longer the silence is expected to last and what
acting would cost — and acts the moment the first exceeds the second, or at a
ceiling it never crosses, whichever comes first.

## What is wrong today

Five things, all of them measured on `dev@97724633`:

- **A cold ledger switches the clock off.** `choose.go` returns an empty
  `Choice` when it knows fewer than two lanes; `hedge.go` refuses to build a
  race when the `Choice` names no alternative; `client.go` builds the watch
  nowhere else. So the case that most needs a deadline — a model nobody has
  measured — is the one case that gets none. A turn waited three minutes with
  no clock of any kind on it.
- **Routing and waiting are one value.** `Choice` answers *which lane* and
  carries `Deadline` and `Alt` as well, so "no opinion about where to send it"
  and "no opinion about when to give up on it" are the same nil.
- **A model picked after launch is never learned about.** The sheet beat's model
  list is fixed at session construction from two config slots. `SetModel` does
  not touch it, and the picker calls `SetModel`. Cold start is therefore the
  steady state for exactly the models people choose deliberately.
- **Thinking defeats the deadline.** A reasoning delta counts as a first token,
  so the first-token branch is left forever and the mid-stream test then needs
  a believed rate the cold ledger does not have. A stall sixty seconds into a
  run of thought is answered by a transport bound two and a half minutes away.
- **A pinned lane that stalls says nothing.** A strict pin sends `only`, carries
  no alternative, and the watch has nowhere to go — which is correct — but the
  surface never mentions it either, so the experience of a pin gone slow is an
  unexplained wait.

Underneath all five is one shape: **absolutes where a belief belongs, and a
belief where an invariant belongs.** A fixed 15-second gap, a fixed 64-token
commitment, one hedge per request, an 8-second ceiling that only exists when a
belief does. This design keeps exactly one absolute — how long a person waits —
and learns everything else.

---

## A. The invariant

**From zero history, for every token-generating call through the funnel, at
every instant the client knows (i) the expected remaining wait given the silence
so far and (ii) what acting would cost. It acts when waiting is expected to cost
more than acting.**

Two clauses bound it:

1. **A hard ceiling bounds time-to-action regardless of belief.** For a role a
   person is reading it is **10 seconds** (`lane.VisiblePatience`); every other
   role scales it by its own `Patience` multiplier. Past the ceiling something
   is done, whatever the arithmetic says, because a belief that recommends
   waiting past a person's patience is answering a question nobody asked.
2. **Unless every reachable lane is believed slow** — in which case acting buys
   nothing, so the act is to *say so*: `all lanes slow` on the HUD, with the
   wait still counting. Silence is never an option; a wait that is real is
   reported.

And one law that is the root cause, stated so it cannot come back:

> **Routing and waiting are two questions and must never share one nil.**
> `lane.Choice` answers which lane. `control.Plan` answers when to act. A call
> with no routing opinion still has a plan, still has a ceiling, and still
> reports. `Choice.Empty()` means "send what you would have sent"; it has never
> meant "wait forever" and now it cannot.

---

## B. One controller for all phases

### The three silences are one question

A request is silent for one of three reasons: nothing has arrived at all, the
endpoint is writing a run of thought nobody can read, or visible text was
arriving and stopped. Until now these were three rule sets in two files. They
are one question asked of three different distributions.

Let `T` be the time to the **next visible progress** and let `s` be how long we
have already waited without it. The controller needs one number:

```
W(s) = E[T − s | T > s]          the expected remaining wait
```

For a log-normal — which is what every measured lane is — **W rises with s**.
That is the property the whole design turns on and it is worth stating plainly:
a stream four seconds late is not four seconds from finishing; it is a draw from
the tail, and the cheapest thing to do with a draw from the tail is to ask
somebody else. `control.Survival.Remaining` is the closed form.

**And `s` is two quantities, not one.** The clock that guards the ANSWER reads
the silence a person is waiting through — the time since the last visible word —
and it is what the action floor and the role's ceiling ask about, because a run
of thought is not progress and nobody is asked to watch an empty line for
longer on the grounds that the endpoint is busy. The clock that guards the WIRE
reads the time since the endpoint last wrote anything at all, readable or not,
and it is what the stall clocks ask about: a lane that has written three words
and is now reasoning has not stopped, and buying it a second request would be
buying one for a lane that never stalled. A heartbeat is not writing and moves
neither.

### What acting costs

For the best alternative lane `a`:

```
A = E[TTFT_a] + V / rate_a + λ · Δ$ + m

  E[TTFT_a]   what a would take to say its first word, from cold, including the
              second request's own handshake
  V / rate_a  regenerating the VISIBLE tokens this stream has already delivered,
              at a's believed rate. Hidden tokens are not in V: a run of thought
              is money already spent and nothing a person would watch disappear.
  λ · Δ$      the second request's money, converted to seconds through the
              role's λ. With λ = 0 nobody is waiting, no money buys speed, and
              the controller never hedges — it only ever reports.
  m           hysteresis, so the controller does not flap at the crossing
```

**Act when `W(s) > A`.** That is the same rule in every phase; only the
distribution behind `W` changes. **It is not, on its own, the whole rule** — the
next section says what else has to be true, and why.

### And what abnormality costs — the second test, and where its threshold comes from

`W(s) > A` answers **does acting pay**. It does not answer **is this lane
misbehaving**, and using it for both is a defect that was measured as one:
`bench/lanelab/REPORT.md`'s warmed-store arm hedged healthy requests MORE often
than a cold one, because a cheap alternative and a tight, correct belief make
"another arm would probably be quicker" true on perfectly ordinary draws. Every
one of those arms was a right answer to the payoff question and a wrong answer
to the question the person is asking.

So an act **before the ceiling** requires both:

```
(1) PAYOFF       W(s) > A
(2) ABNORMALITY  s > Quantile(z) of the very survival that clock reads
```

— the first-token clock against the first-token survival, the drift clock
against the gap survival, the duration clock against the think survival. **The
ceiling is untouched and stays absolute**: at the role's ceiling the controller
acts whatever both tests say, and what it does there — hedge, ask, or report —
is unchanged, so time-to-action cannot regress.

**`z` is derived from the acceptance criterion, not chosen.** This is a
Neyman–Pearson test and it is sized the way one is sized: fix the false-positive
rate you will pay, and that fixes the threshold.

Under the null — the lane is fine — the wait at any one alarm opportunity is a
draw from that clock's own survival, so the chance it exceeds that clock's own
`1 − p` quantile is exactly `p`. A request offers `k` such opportunities, so by
the union bound the chance that any of them raises a false act is at most
`k · p`. §K already fixes that number at **2% of healthy requests**. Therefore

```
k · p ≤ 0.02        the per-request false-act budget, from §K
p     = 0.02 / k    per-opportunity tail mass
z     = Φ⁻¹(1 − p)
```

The union bound is conservative — the true rate is at most `k · p` — so the gate
is at least as strict as the budget asks and never looser.

**`k` is counted from the request's own shape.** A request has exactly one first
token; its run of thought is asked about once, as a whole; and the drift clock
is asked once per gap between two visible tokens, which is how long the answer
is expected to be — a figure the transport already states before the stream
starts.

```
k = 1 (the first token) + 1 (the thought) + E[visible tokens] (the gaps)
```

Where nobody said how long the answer would be, `k` is the two opportunities the
request certainly has. Counting the unknown ones at a guess would be inventing
evidence; counting them at zero is the honest floor, and the ceiling bounds what
the looser gate lets through.

**Two things this cannot do.** It cannot delay a genuinely stalled lane, because
a stall crosses any quantile of its own distribution within seconds — that is
what a stall is. And it cannot refuse on a number nobody measured: an unknown
survival has no quantile, so the gate stands open, and the payoff test is closed
in exactly that case because `W` on an unknown belief is zero. A plan with no
belief is bounded by its ceiling and by nothing else, exactly as before.

### The three distributions

| phase | `T` is | learned from | while it runs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **silent** — nothing at all has arrived | the serving lane's first token | every finished stream's TTFT | a heartbeat proves the path, never resets `s` |
| **thinking** — reasoning deltas, no visible word | *two* clocks: how long this model's whole thinking phase lasts, and the gap between two thinking deltas | thinking duration per `(model, effort rung)`; gaps from the lane's rate | the stream is ALIVE — no cut — and `s` keeps running |
| **writing** — visible text arriving | the gap between two visible tokens | the lane's rate posterior | each visible token resets `s` |

**A legitimately long think is not a stall and must not be hedged blindly.** A
model asked at the top rung may deliberate for a minute; hedging it fires a
second minute-long think and buys nothing. So the thinking phase is judged
against a *learned duration model* for that `(model, rung)`, not against the
lane's first-token belief — and the ceiling still applies, which is what keeps
the invariant true when the duration model is itself cold.

**A stalled think is a stall.** The second clock catches it: thinking deltas
arrive at the lane's believed rate like any other token, so a run of thought
that goes quiet for longer than that rate excuses is acted on exactly as a quiet
answer is.

**Heartbeats never reset the silence clock.** `: OPENROUTER PROCESSING` is proof
about the *path* and about nothing else. It keeps the dead-path claim from
firing and it keeps the lane's belief from being charged for somebody's wifi. A
clock it reset would be a clock a router could hold open forever by saying
nothing in a well-formed way.

### Which act

The controller returns one of six kinds. The order below is the ladder, and it
is the one already in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — this design does not invent a
second one.

| act | when | what happens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `None` | `W(s) ≤ A` and `s < ceiling` | keep waiting; this is the answer to almost every question |
| `Hedge` | `W(s) > A`, an alternative exists, the purse allows | another arm to `Act.Lane`; the ladder's rung 1 |
| `Ask` | the same, but a **person pinned** this lane | the offer, §E. A pin is asked, never overridden |
| `Report` | no alternative, or every alternative is believed no better | the HUD says the wait is real and why; nothing is sent |
| `Escalate` | every gate-passing lane has been tried and none answered | hands off to the EXISTING model ladder (`internal/provider/endpoints.go`, rung 4). The controller never changes a model itself |
| `Commit` | this arm has earned the answer | the same inequality read backwards: cancel the others |

**`Commit` is not a second rule.** Past the first tokens the question "should I
abandon this?" is the same inequality with `V` set to what this arm has already
written: leaving costs `E[TTFT_a] + V/rate_a`, and staying costs `W(s)`. When
staying is cheaper the arm keeps the answer. That is what retires `commitTokens
= 64` as an absolute — a number that was right for a 400-token reply and wrong
for a 4,000-token one — and it is why there is no separate commitment constant
anywhere in this design.

### Many arms, one budget

`Hedge` may fire more than once. What bounds it is money, not a counter:

- **Arms are bounded by the purse**, which since 2026-09-11 is the CALL'S OWN
  budget (`control.Plan.SpendUSD`: its patience converted through λ) rather than
  the rolling `lane.Budget` this section was written against — that one allowed
  two rescues in any twenty requests and a tenth of the last hour's spend, and it
  refused by arrival order. `maxArms = 4` stays as the absolute cap on one
  question, and it is now the only thing that counts arms.
- **First visible progress takes the voice.** Whichever arm writes the first
  word a person can read is the arm they hear; the others are held, exactly as
  today's one-voice rule holds them.
- **`Commit` cancels the losers**, and cancelling stops the bill on most lanes
  (measured: about twenty of them, OpenAI, Anthropic and Fireworks named).
- **A hedge is a measurement** whichever way it lands. That law is unchanged and
  it is what makes the second request nearly free in information terms.

Dean & Barroso's figure is the sanity check on the whole mechanism: **one to two
per cent extra requests removes most of the p99.** If the arms are costing more
than that, the deadlines are firing too early and the proof in §K says so.

## C. Beliefs: global, hierarchical, time-adaptive

### Why a flat ledger cannot answer a cold start

A belief per `(model, lane)` is blind on the first request to every pair, and
the first request to a pair is the steady state. The measured world says why
that is unnecessary: on 2026-08-30, seventeen lanes of `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`
spanned **430 ms to 3030 ms** on first-token p50 (7×) and **6 to 75** tokens a
second (12×) — and those differences are *properties of the machines*, which
mostly persist when the same machines serve a different model. A ledger that
throws that away asks the same question from scratch for every pair.

### The sum

```
ln T(model, lane)  =  μ  +  a[lane]  +  b[model]  +  e[model, lane]
```

| term | is | moves on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `μ` | the world's own pace | everything |
| `a[lane]` | this **provider**, across every model it serves | every sighting of that provider |
| `b[model]` | this **model**, across every provider | every sighting of that model |
| `e[model, lane]` | this deployment, right now | only its own sightings |

A prediction is the sum of the four means with the sum of the four variances. A
pair nobody has measured predicts from `μ + a + b` with an honestly wide spread
— which is exactly "we know roughly, and not precisely" — and cold start needs
no special case anywhere. `lane.Chain` is the type; `lane.Chain.Predict` is the
sum.

Three chains are kept per subject: `ln TTFT` in milliseconds, `ln rate` in
tokens a second, and `ln thinking duration` in seconds keyed on
`(model, effort rung)` — the last has no lane term, because a lane cannot make a
model think less, it can only make the same thought arrive faster, which the
rate chain already says.

Quality stays a **Beta** and stays a **gate, never a weight** (Decision 10's
law). It is hierarchical in the same shape — a provider that truncates on one
model usually truncates on another — but its parent is borrowed as a *prior*
rather than summed, because a success count is not additive in the log domain.

### The update, exactly

One observation `z` (already in the log domain) with observation noise `R`. The
prediction is the sum, so the innovation variance is the sum:

```
ŷ = Σ X_i                            i over the four levels
S = Σ P_i + R
ν = (z − ŷ) / √S                     the standardized residual

for each level i:
    K_i  = P_i / S                   this level's share of the surprise
    X_i ← X_i + K_i · (z − ŷ)
    P_i ← P_i · (1 − K_i)
```

This is a scalar Kalman update on a four-dimensional diagonal state with
`H = [1 1 1 1]`. It is eight lines of arithmetic and it has the property the
design needs: **a level that is already certain absorbs almost none of the
surprise, and a level that knows nothing absorbs almost all of it.** The first
sighting of a brand-new provider moves `a[lane]` a long way and `μ` barely at
all; the thousandth moves `e` and nothing else.

Ageing, per level, per unit of time with no observation:

```
P_i ← min( P_i · 2^(Δt / halfLife_i),  ceiling_i )
```

The estimate is never moved — we have no reason to think a lane got faster, only
a reason to be less sure — and the ceiling is what stops a belief becoming
*worse* than free. This is `Posterior.Predict`'s law, kept, and now stated four
times with four half-lives.

### The numbers, and which are priors

**Half-lives** — how fast each fact really turns over:

| level | half-life | why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `e[model, lane]` | **10 min** | one deployment's queue. Unchanged from today's `HalfLife`, which was measured against real recovery. |
| `a[lane]` | **30 min** | a provider's fleet: a capacity event moves every model it serves, and it is over in the half hour the sheet aggregates on. |
| `b[model]` | **6 h** | a model's size and shape. It changes when a deployment is re-quantized, not within a session. |
| `μ` | **24 h** | the world's pace. |
| quality (all levels) | **60 min** | `QualityHalfLife`, unchanged: what a lane *is* holds for hours, and forgetting it at the speed of load makes the gate inert. |

All five are **priors to be learned**: the build ships with these and
`bench/lanelab` fits them against replayed sightings. They are the only numbers
in this design that are guesses, and they are guesses about how fast the world
changes rather than about how fast a lane is.

**Prior widths** at each level, in nats of log-spread, for a process that has
seen nothing:

| level | σ | why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `μ` | 1.2 | first-token medians across the measured seventeen span ln(3030/430) = 1.95, so a spread that covers most of it without claiming to. |
| `a[lane]` | 0.9 | most of the observed spread is between providers. |
| `b[model]` | 0.6 | less than between providers, on the models this build talks to. |
| `e[model, lane]` | 0.5 | what is left after the two above. |

**Fixed, and not priors** — these are statements about people and about physics,
not about machines, and nothing learns them:

| constant | value | what it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lane.VisiblePatience` | 10 s | how long a person watching an empty line is asked to wait. |
| `lane.ActionFloor` | 700 ms | below this a second request is racing the network, not the lane: it has its own handshake and prefill to pay. |
| `lane.ReadRate` | 18 tok/s | how fast a person reads; the ceiling on how much delivery speed is worth buying. |
| role `Patience` | ×0.5 … ×6 | §F. |

### The sheet is a prior, and it is also the only measurement of a tail

The endpoints sheet enters as a pseudo-observation at `R = k·σ₀²` with
`k = SheetWeight = 4`, into `e[model, lane]` — never into `μ` or `a[lane]`,
because a sheet is published per model and folding it into the world's pace
would let one refresh move every belief this process holds.

**And it enters as an OFFSET, which means the pair's own level takes the whole
of it.** A row is an absolute first token and a belief is a sum, so what is left
to learn from a row is this deployment's distance from what its parents already
say. Shared out as a Kalman gain it was not learnt at all: `μ` holds most of the
variance and may not move, so the level that may took about a sixth of the
difference and a lane the sheet published at 430 ms was believed at 1.2 s.
`e[model, lane]` carries the difference in full and `Chain.Predict` comes back
on the published number. The variances still shrink by each level's own gain,
because how much a row TEACHES is a different question from where it puts the
median: a half-hour aggregate at `SheetWeight` teaches little, so the belief is
centred on the sheet and honestly unsure of it. **`b[model]` is no longer moved
by a row** — an offset that landed there too would be re-aimed by the next row
of the same sheet, leaving every pair but the last centred somewhere nobody
published.

**Its spread is floored and it is never a certainty.** Today `derivedDeadline`
reads `TTFT.Quantile(1.2816)` raw, which is the variance of the *estimate* — it
shrinks to nothing with evidence, and a controller reading it believes a tail
impossible. `Chain.Survival(draw, unit)` is the one door that converts a chain
into a distribution to wait against, and the floor is not optional.

**The floor is the lane's own variability, and one figure for every lane is not
it.** A sheet row carries a p50 and a p90, and the distance between them *is*
that lane's measured dispersion — `ln(p90/p50) / 1.2816`, between about 0.15 and
1.0 nat across the seventeen measured. This build already keeps it per pair,
because it is the same number a sighting is weighed against as observation
noise; `Hierarchy.Draw` reads it back. Only a pair nobody has published anything
about falls back to the prior:

| constant | value | what it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lane.SpreadFloor` | 1.0 nat | how variable one answer is taken to be where nothing has been published: the shape the measured sheet published on its **worst** lanes (p90 ≈ 3.5 × p50). |

**Held under every lane instead, it was measurably wrong**, and §K is where it
showed. A lane publishing 430 ms and 900 ms has σ = 0.577; floored at 1.0 its
`W(0.7 s)` is 0.876 s where its own spread gives 0.305 s, and acting costs about
0.71 s — so a perfectly healthy request wanted a second one at the first instant
an act was legal. `bench/lanelab/REPORT.md` measures both sides of it: the
per-lane floor halves the false-hedge rate and the spend overhead, and neither
reaches §K's threshold on the proof rows, which is a finding about the
inequality rather than about the floor.

### Change points

The world moves in steps as well as drifting: a provider adds capacity, a
deployment is re-quantized, a region fails over. Exponential forgetting handles
drift and is far too slow for a step.

**A one-sided CUSUM on the standardized residual `ν`, per pair:**

```
S⁺ ← max(0, S⁺ + ν − k)              slower than believed
S⁻ ← max(0, S⁻ − ν − k)              faster than believed
k = 0.5, h = 4.0                     nats of surprise
```

When either exceeds `h`, **reset `e[model, lane]` toward its parents** — mean to
zero, variance to the prior width — and clear both sums. Nothing else is reset:
`μ`, `a` and `b` are shared facts and a step in one deployment is not evidence
about them. The reset is recorded (`Hierarchy.Shifted`) so the call log can say
why a lane suddenly moved, and it is the only mechanism in this package that
changes an estimate rather than a variance.

`k = 0.5` and `h = 4.0` are the standard slack and alarm for detecting a one-σ
shift in about eight observations; both are priors to be fitted in the sim.

### Diurnal: argued for, and not built

**Recommendation: do not add it.** The argument for is real — router load has a
daily shape and a term for it would predict the 09:00 slowdown before it
happened. Three arguments against, and they win today:

1. **The data is not there.** A diurnal term needs weeks of observations per
   subject at the level it lives at, and the level it would live at is
   `a[lane]`, whose half-life is thirty minutes. A person's own ledger will
   rarely hold two clean cycles of any one provider.
2. **The existing mechanism already tracks it, with a lag.** A daily swing is
   slow compared to a 30-minute half-life plus a CUSUM that fires in eight
   observations. What a diurnal term buys is the *first* few requests of the
   swing, not the swing.
3. **It is the kind of term that looks right and is not checkable.** Nothing in
   the proof plan can distinguish a fitted diurnal component from an overfitted
   one on a single machine's traffic.

**The condition for adding it:** `bench/lanelab` reports residual autocorrelation
at 24 hours, on replayed real sightings, above what the drift model explains. If
that appears, the term is one more component in the sum — `c[lane, hour]` with a
long half-life — and nothing else in this design changes. The shape was chosen
to leave that door open.

### The file, and two processes

Today's store writes the whole belief set and merges last-writer-wins per lane.
**The hierarchy makes that actively wrong:** two processes each hold `μ`, `a`
and `b` for the *same* subjects and each has folded different evidence into
them. "Newer wins" then discards one process's afternoon because the other
happened to save second, and the shared levels are exactly the ones that make
cold start work.

**So the store becomes state plus an append-only observation journal.**

```
~/.codeaf/v3/lanes.json     the compacted state: version, the chains, the Beta
                            counts, the facts, and the moment it was written
~/.codeaf/v3/lanes.log      one line per observation since the last compaction
```

- **Append.** After an answer — never on the send path — one line of NDJSON is
  appended: `{id, ttft, gen, gap, tokens, prompt, cached, probe, at}` or an
  outcome. One `write(2)` under `O_APPEND`, about 150 bytes, with a **shared**
  advisory lock held across it.
- **Load.** Read the state, replay the whole journal into it in time order.
  Observations commute in this filter to first order and exactly in time order,
  so every process converges on the same belief. A missing journal is an empty
  one; an unparseable line is skipped and counted.
- **Compact.** On the beat, when the journal passes 512 records or 10 minutes:
  take the **exclusive** lock — which no appender can be inside — replay,
  write the state atomically through a temporary file and a rename, `ftruncate`
  the journal to zero, release. The rename is why the lock file is separate from
  both, exactly as today.
- **A lock that cannot be taken is not a reason to lose a belief.** The current
  fallback is kept: on a filesystem with no advisory locking the work still
  happens, unlocked, which is what a lone process has always done.
- **Migration.** A `lanes.json` holding today's flat array is read as the pair
  level of a fresh hierarchy, with `μ`, `a` and `b` unknown. Nothing is thrown
  away and nothing is claimed that was not measured.

Why not keep last-writer-wins: it cannot merge shared components. Why not a
journal alone with no compacted state: an unbounded replay on every process
start is a cold start that gets slower every day.

## D. Choice

The chooser is largely right and this design changes four things about it.

**The score is unchanged in shape.** After the capability gate — tools, context,
quantization, uptime, `status` — Thompson sampling over

```
score = T_perceived + tail + λ · price
T_perceived = max(TTFT, …) + visible/min(rate, ReadRate) + hidden/rate
tail        = the p90 term, because a person remembers the twelve-second wait
              and not the four-hundred-millisecond one
```

The reading-rate ceiling stays: delivery faster than 18 tokens a second buys a
person nothing, so a lane is not paid for it.

**λ is the role's** (§F), and the highest λ belongs to the role a person is
reading. Background roles are cheap and `λ = 0` is price-only, which is the
honest reading of "nobody is waiting".

**What changes:**

1. **`len(beliefs) < 2` stops being a refusal.** With the hierarchy, a model
   nobody has measured still has a prediction for every lane the *sheet* names
   and for every provider the *world* has seen. An order of one is still not a
   ranking — that law stands — but "one lane in the ledger" is no longer the
   same thing as "one lane known".
2. **`Choice` loses `Deadline` and `Alt`.** They belong to `control.Plan`, which
   is built for every call. `Choice` carries `Order`, `Only`, `Ignore`,
   `Frontier` and `Why` and nothing about time.
3. **A never-seen model triggers a one-shot asynchronous sheet refresh** and
   answers from the hierarchy meanwhile. The refresh is queued to the beat and
   **never on the send path** — that law is untouched and its structural test
   still holds it.
4. **`SetModel` informs the beat.** A model the session moves to is added to the
   beat's list and refreshed once, at once. Without this the first three changes
   are unreachable for exactly the models people pick deliberately.

`provider.order` still carries the top three with `allow_fallbacks` on, because
a slow answer beats no answer. Probe-on-typing stays optional and unchanged: at
about half a thousandth of a cent it is the cheapest sighting there is, and it
measures our own path rather than everybody's.

## E. A pinned lane is asked, never overridden

Same controller, same arithmetic, different act. Where an unpinned call would
`Hedge`, a pinned one raises `Ask`.

**What a person sees**, on the status line, in the segment the phase clock
already owns:

```
coreweave is slow · switch to auto? (y)
```

**The rules:**

- **It is raised once.** A second offer for one request would be nagging.
- **`y` fires the rescue at once** — the same hedge the controller would have
  fired, to the same lane the frontier already named. There is no second choice
  made at the worst possible moment.
- **Any visible token withdraws it.** The pin came good; the question is moot;
  the line goes back to what it was. A thinking delta does **not** withdraw it,
  because nothing has arrived that a person can read.
- **It also withdraws at `PhaseWindow`** (15 s), like every other phase, so a
  question about a request that is over never sits on the screen.
- **Once, it may set pinned-borrow.** After the offer is accepted the surface
  asks — once per profile, not per request — whether the pin should borrow when
  it stalls in future, and writes `lane.<slot>.borrow` if so. That is the
  existing `LanePin{Borrow: true}` row and no new setting.
- **The pin itself is untouched.** Accepting is for *this answer*. The next
  request goes to the pinned machine, because that is what a pin means.

**The message types.** The offer rides the phase channel that already exists —
`provider.PhaseNews` → `session.OnPhaseNews` → `tui3.PostPhaseNews` — because a
second channel for one sentence is a second thing to keep alive.

```go
// internal/provider/phase.go
const PhaseAsking Phase = "asking"   // a wait a person can end

// PhaseNews gains one field:
//   Ask string — an opaque token naming the open offer, empty when there is none.

// internal/provider/offer.go  (new)
func AnswerOffer(ask string, yes bool) bool   // true when an offer was still open
```

`PhaseNews.Detail` carries `"coreweave is slow"`, `Then` carries `"auto"`, and
`Waiting()` includes `PhaseAsking`. The offer registry is a small map with a
mutex, entries expiring at `PhaseWindow`, living beside the race that owns them.

**The keystroke.** `y` in `internal/tui3`, taken **only while an offer is live
for the model on screen and the composer is empty**. Somebody who is typing is
writing their next message, not answering a question, and a surface that stole a
`y` out of a sentence would be worse than the wait. The manual page for lanes
gains the offer and its key in the same change (the manual law).

**With no surface at all** — `codeaf do`, a standing run, any headless session —
there is nobody to ask, and the invariant still holds. So:

> **A pinned lane with no reader borrows at the ceiling, once, and says so in
> the log.** `pinned lane coreweave was silent for 10s — borrowing auto for this
> answer`.

The reason is the whole point of the pin: a pin is a person's instruction, and
an instruction whose author cannot be reached at the moment it becomes expensive
is honoured by getting them their answer and telling them what was done. The
alternative — a headless run that waits forever on a machine that has gone
quiet — is the defect this design exists to remove, and it is worse in a
headless run than anywhere else, because nobody is watching to notice.

"No reader" is `provider.OnPhase` having no registered reader — the same seam
the surface uses — so nothing new has to be configured and the two cannot drift.

---

## F. Every call

The funnel law stands: **one function sends a completion on the wire, and
everything that goes through it is watched.** The role sets λ and the ceiling
multiplier; it never sets whether a ceiling exists.

| role | λ | patience | ceiling | why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `talk` | interactive | ×1 | **10 s** | a person is reading this stream |
| `leaf.attached` | interactive | ×1 | **10 s** | somebody is watching the room it runs in |
| `leaf.unattended` | 0 | ×3 | 30 s | nobody is there; the seconds are only worth money once somebody is |
| `standing` | 0 | ×6 | 60 s | unattended by construction, and long by design |
| `memory` | 0 | ×3 | 30 s | a reflex nobody waits on |
| `auxiliary` | 0 | ×3 | 30 s | a title, a route question, a fold-up |
| `judge` | 0, critical | ×6 | 60 s | on the path to something that is waiting, and worth being right |
| `design` | 0, critical | ×6 | 60 s | the same, and longer answers |
| `probe` | 0 | ×0.5 | 5 s | one token bought on a keystroke; a probe that is slow has already told us what we asked |
| `unknown` | 0 | ×3 | 30 s | the conservative reading |
| `media` | interactive | ×6 | 60 s | **outside the token controller — see below** |

**`RoleMedia` stays outside, and the exclusion is from the token controller
rather than from patience.** An image, a piece of music, a transcription: they
produce no token stream at all (`RoleFacts.Streams` is false), so there is no
first token, no gap between tokens and no rate to be surprised by. What bounds
them is a single expected duration and the transport's own wall, which is what
they have today. Giving them a phase machine with three distributions and no
tokens to drive it would be machinery that could only ever be wrong.

There is still **no role for a hedge**. The second request of a race is the same
errand as the first, so it inherits the role it is rescuing — and therefore its
λ, its ceiling and its place on the status line.

---

## G. Observability

**The HUD** says four things and no more:

```
via cloudflare · 0.6s · 61 t/s        an ordinary answer, and who wrote it
slow · trying parasail…               a rescue is in flight
via parasail · rescued                it worked, for this answer only
coreweave is slow · switch to auto? (y)   a pin, and a question
all lanes slow · still waiting        every reachable lane is believed slow
```

The last is new and it is the visible half of `Report`. It is the only honest
thing to say when there is nowhere better to go, and saying nothing was the old
behaviour.

**The call log** gains four fields on `calllog.Record`, beside the `DeadlineMs`,
`Lane` and `Hedged` it already carries:

| field | is |
| --- | --- |
| `SilenceMs` | how long the silence had run when something was done about it |
| `Action` | what was done: `hedge`, `ask`, `report`, `escalate`, `commit`, or absent |
| `Arms` | how many requests this one question put on the wire |
| `WasteUSD` | what the arms that did not answer cost |

Together with what is already there — the order that was sent, the lane that was
asked for, the lane that served, the deadline that was computed — a row now
answers the question this design was written for in one line: *when did it act,
what did it believe, what did it do, and what did it cost.*

**And the reasoning is on the row, not only the outcome.** `Act.Wait` and
`Act.Cost` are the two numbers the inequality was decided on; a log that records
the decision without them can only ever confirm what somebody already suspected.

## H. Module map

Packages and files, each with one responsibility.

| where | owns | may not |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `internal/lane/control` (new) | the hazard controller: `Survival`, `Plan`, `Act`, `Controller`. Pure functions over a moment and a belief. | import anything but the standard library — not even its parent |
| `internal/lane/hier.go` (new) | the four-level chain: fold, age, change-point | open a connection, read a clock |
| `internal/lane/journal.go` (new) | the append-only observation log and its compaction | be on a send path |
| `internal/lane/store.go` | the compacted state file, its lock and its migration | decide anything |

| `internal/lane/choose.go` | the gate, the Pareto prune, the Thompson draw | say anything about time |
| `internal/lane/waiting.go` | the contract between them, and the one place the controller is installed | implement the controller |

| `internal/provider/offer.go` (new) | open offers and their answers | draw anything |
| `internal/provider/client.go` | the stream loop, and one `control.Reading` per event | hold a policy |
| `internal/session/agent.go` | `SetModel` → the beat | know how a belief is computed |
| `internal/tui3` | the offer keystroke and the HUD | compute a belief |

**The contract, as written in this commit:**

| `deadlineCeiling = 8s` | replaced by the role ceiling, which exists whether or not a belief does |
| `derivedDeadline` reading a raw quantile | replaced by `Chain.Survival`, floored at the lane's own published dispersion |
| `internal/lane/watch.go` as a policy | it becomes a thin adapter, or it goes |

## I. The laws, held by the build

Two files, written in this commit, each law named as a sentence and each failing
with a file name and a line number — the convention `internal/lane/structure_test.go`
set and `internal/provider/funnel_law_test.go` follows.

| file | holds |
| --- | --- |
| `internal/lane/law_test.go` | the invariant and the arithmetic: every role is bounded; routing and waiting are two types; a cold belief still yields a deadline; thinking does not stop the clock; a heartbeat does not reset the silence; a pin is asked; nothing to hedge to is reported; beliefs decay; the controller comes from one factory; no test writes the real home |
| `internal/provider/waiting_law_test.go` | the wiring: every funnel call has a controller; the controller is installed exactly once; a heartbeat is reported as a heartbeat; a pinned lane can raise an offer; the call log says why it waited and what it did; `SetModel` reaches the beat; every streaming role is bounded and media is not |

Most of them are red today. They are listed with their lane in "Laws currently
red" below, and a law that is red for a reason nobody wrote down is a law
somebody will delete.

**`TestNoTestWritesTheRealHome` is a law about this repo's own tests**, and it is
here because breaking it costs somebody else their belief file. The junk found
in `~/.codeaf/v3/lanes.json` on the machine this was written on came from the
sheet beat's own test, which used the default registry without moving
`CODEAF_HOME`. That one is fixed in this commit; two more are red and belong to
W5.

---

## J. Build plan

Four lanes in parallel worktrees off `feat/waiting-policy`, then one integration
lane. File ownership is strict and disjoint; no two lanes edit one file.

**One rule makes the parallelism real:** W2, W3 and W4 must not read
`Choice.Deadline` or `Choice.Alt`. They are left in place by this commit so the
tree compiles, they are read by nobody once the lanes land, and **W5 deletes
them** — a pure deletion that cannot conflict.

| lane | owns | goal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **W1 beliefs** | `internal/lane/{hier.go, hier_test.go, journal.go, journal_test.go, belief.go, belief_test.go, posterior.go, store.go, store_test.go, quality_test.go}` | the four-level chain, its decay, its change-point, and a store two processes can share without losing an afternoon |
| **W2 controller** | `internal/lane/control/**`, `internal/lane/{waiting.go, watch.go, watch_test.go, watchserving_test.go, roles.go}` | one hazard controller for all three phases, installed once, testable on a fake clock |
| **W3 the wire** | `internal/provider/{hedge.go, client.go, lanes_ctx.go, offer.go, phase.go, calllog.go, hedge_test.go, offer_test.go}`, `internal/calllog/calllog.go` | a controller on every call, k arms under one purse, the offer seam, and a log an autopsy can read |
| **W4 choice & surface** | `internal/lane/{choose.go, choose_test.go, frontier.go, sheet.go}`, `internal/session/{agent.go, phasenews.go, lanenews.go}`, `internal/tui3/{lanes.go, phase.go, keys.go}`, `internal/manual/chat/lanes.md` | cold start answered from the hierarchy, `SetModel` → beat, the `y` key and the HUD |
| **W5 integration** | `internal/lane/contract.go`, `internal/lane/{e2e_test.go, lane_test.go}`, `bench/lanelab/**`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/changes/unreleased/` | delete the two `Choice` fields, extend the sim, fix the last two home-pollution tests, retire the clock rows |

### W1 — beliefs

*Implements* `lane.Hierarchy`, `lane.Chain` folding and ageing, the journal.
*Unit tests*: a fold moves an unknown level and not a certain one; four
half-lives age four ways; a CUSUM resets the leaf and not the parents; two
`Ledger`s over one file both see each other's observations; a v1 `lanes.json`
migrates without loss; an unparseable journal line is skipped and counted.
*Turns green*: `TestBeliefsDecayWhenUnobserved`.

### W2 — controller

*Implements* `control.New`, and `SetController` at `internal/lane`'s init.
*Unit tests*: a fake clock and a scripted `Plan`; `W(s)` rises for a log-normal;
the crossing is found where the closed form says; the ceiling fires with no
belief; a heartbeat does not move `s`; a thinking delta moves the phase and not
`s`; a pinned plan asks; an empty `Alts` reports; commit is the same inequality;
`Deadline()` never returns a moment in the past.
*Turns green*: `TestUnknownBeliefStillYieldsADeadline`,
`TestThinkingDoesNotStopTheClock`, `TestHeartbeatsDoNotResetSilence`,
`TestAPinnedLaneRaisesAnOfferNotAHedge`,
`TestWithNothingToHedgeToTheWaitIsReported`,
`TestTheControllerIsInstalledExactlyOnce`.

### W3 — the wire

*Implements* the unconditional controller in `completeWithMessagesStreaming`,
one `control.Reading` per stream event, k arms under the purse, `offer.go`,
`PhaseAsking`, the four log fields.
*Unit tests*: against `lanestub` — a cold store still cuts over; a heartbeat-only
stream is acted on; a stalled thinker is acted on and a long thinker is not; an
offer is raised, answered, and withdrawn by a token; a headless run borrows and
logs; losers are cancelled and the stub counts the cancels.
*Turns green*: `TestEveryFunnelCallHasAController`,
`TestAHeartbeatIsReportedAsAHeartbeat`, `TestAPinnedLaneCanRaiseAnOffer`,
`TestTheCallLogSaysWhyItWaitedAndWhatItDid`.

### W4 — choice & surface

*Implements* cold start from the hierarchy, the one-shot async refresh,
`SetModel` → beat, the `y` key, the two new HUD lines, the manual page.
*Unit tests*: a model with no ledger entry produces an order; the refresh is
queued and never awaited; `SetModel` adds to the beat; the key is ignored while
the composer has text; `tuiwords` for the two new strings.
*Turns green*: `TestSetModelReachesTheBeat`.

### W5 — integration & proof

*Implements* the `Choice` field deletions, the sim scenarios (§K), the
`ARCHITECTURE.md` table, the changelog entry, and the two remaining
home-pollution fixes in `e2e_test.go` and `lane_test.go`.
*Turns green*: `TestRoutingAndWaitingNeverShareANil`,
`TestNoTestWritesTheRealHome`.

### The e2e recipe

`bench/lanelab/gosim` already drives the real `lane` package over `lanestub`.
Four scenarios are added, and each is a row of the pass table in §K:

| scenario | staged with |
| --- | --- |
| **cold store** | `-prime=none`, a fresh `CODEAF_HOME` per seed, no sheet |
| **stalled lane** | `lanestub.Profile.StallAfter` / `StallFor` on the modal lane |
| **thinking model** | `lanestub.Profile.Reasoning` set long, with and without a stall inside it |
| **pinned lane** | a policy that sends `only:[pin]`, with and without a reader for the offer |

Real models, under the existing tag:

```sh
go test -tags e2e ./internal/lane/ -run TestReal -v
```

with one new case — a pinned slow lane on a real router raises an offer, and `y`
lands the answer from somewhere else.

---

## K. Proof

### The simulator

`bench/lanelab/sim.py` and `bench/lanelab/gosim` keep their existing gate — **p90
at least 30% better than the `default` arm at no more than the wait it bought,
priced through λ** — and gain four pass criteria that are about the invariant
rather than about the average:

| criterion | threshold | why that number |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **time-to-action, stalled lane, cold store, talk role** | ≤ 10 s in **100%** of trials | it is the invariant. Not a percentile: a ceiling that holds 99% of the time is not a ceiling. |
| **false hedges on a healthy lane** | ≤ **2%** of requests | Dean & Barroso's measured figure for how much extra traffic removes most of a p99. Above it the deadline is firing early and the money is real. |
| **spend overhead** | ≤ **3%** of the arm's own bill | the sheet's own price spread is 4.7× between the dearest and the median lane, so 3% is well inside the noise of choosing a different lane at all. |
| **long think, not hedged** | ≥ **95%** of legitimate thinking phases finish without an arm — **on an arm whose store has been warmed**; REPORTED where it has not | the failure mode this design most risks introducing. The warmed/cold split is not an allowance, and the next paragraph is why. |

Two more, reported and not gated, because they are what the next argument will
be about: the distribution of `s` at the moment of action, and the share of
actions that were `Report` rather than `Hedge`.

**Where each criterion is enforced.** The four are measured on several arms — a
store that has watched answers and one that has not, a rig that breaks half of
everything and a mix that breaks one request in twenty — and they do not all
mean the same thing on all of them. The shape, with `bench/lanelab/REPORT.md`
carrying the numbers:

| criterion | gated on | reported on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| time-to-action | every arm — it is the invariant | — |
| false hedges ≤ 2% | warmed arms | cold arms, where an arm is exploration |
| spend, avoidable | a warmed arm at the natural fault rate | everywhere else |
| spend, total | — | every arm, against the no-policy baseline |
| long think ≥ 95% | **warmed arms, at full force** | **cold arms** |

**And why the long think splits that way.** §B's second test asks whether a wait
is past the `1 − p` quantile of the survival its clock reads. For the duration
clock that survival is the model's whole thinking phase, and **a thinking phase
has no published dispersion** — so `Chain.Survival` stood on `SpreadFloor` and
the quantile settled at about `median · e^(z·SpreadFloor)`: roughly fifteen
times the believed median, which against a ten-second ceiling is **eighty-three
seconds**. The gate could not close at any amount of evidence, and on an arm
with no timing belief the long-think rate therefore stopped being a fact about
the controller: it counted how often the world's own thinking phase outlasts the
ceiling, which is a property of the model and of the role's patience and which
no correct policy changes. On a warmed arm the first-token and gap clocks are
sharp, the arms that land inside a thought are ones a policy really does decide,
and the criterion is about the build again — so that is where it binds.

**The floor now lifts — issue #316, closed by the first of its two candidates.**
Nobody publishes how much one run of thought varies; something **observes** it,
because every `NoteThinking` is one draw of exactly that quantity. So the think
chain keeps its own dispersion account per (model, rung) — Welford's count, mean
and sum of squared deviations, folded on the same lock as the belief — and
`Thinks` passes THAT to `Chain.Survival` instead of the constant. The law is the
sample spread pooled with the prior at one observation's weight,
`σ² = (SpreadFloor² + Σ(z − z̄)²) / n`, floored at `SpreadTightest` so a tail is
never called impossible. Measured through the real door on the proof rows' own
model, **the gate closes at n = 31** and σ settles at 0.174 against the 1.0
prior; a model whose thinking really varies by 0.9 nats keeps σ = 0.909 and its
gate stays open, which is the half that makes the close safe.

**What the close does NOT recover, and the arithmetic that says so.** #316's
acceptance asked for the 4.95 s p50 time-to-action on a stalled thought that
this design trades for the 10 s ceiling. It is not recovered and it cannot be by
this candidate, because the gate is only half of §B. The duration clock's payoff
term prices leaving a thought at **a whole fresh thought** —
`A = cost + Think.Mean()` — so `W(s) > A + m` needs the remaining life of THIS
thought to exceed an entire new one, and for a log-normal that happens only far
into the tail: at σ = 0.15 and a 5.5 s median it first happens at **15.8 s**,
past the ceiling, and there is **no σ at all** at which both tests pass before a
10 s ceiling for a model with that median. A stopped thought is abnormal in its
GAP, not in its duration, which is candidate 2 of #316 — a think-phase drift
quantile — and it remains open.

### The live A/B

`bench/lanelab/live.sh --compare` runs two arms against one real router on one
account, alternating request by request so a slow ten minutes hits both:

- **Arm X** is `dev` as it stands. **Arm Y** is this design.
- **The labels are opaque** until the numbers are in. The operator does not know
  which is which while reading them, because the person who built a thing is the
  worst possible reader of its first run — `docs/design/routing/provider-routing.md` Part IV
  records a live test that congratulated itself, and this is the guard against a
  second one.
- **One price table for both arms**, and the diff is what is judged: p90 wait,
  time-to-action on the stalls that occurred, arms per request, dollars per
  thousand requests.
- **The cold-store half is run first**, from an empty `CODEAF_HOME`, because that
  is the state the reported defect happened in and a warmed ledger would hide it.

### Laws currently red — none, as of the integration lane

Written before the work, failing honestly, and now every one of them green. The
table is kept rather than deleted because the interesting column is the third
one: what each law was red FOR is the shape of the defect this design was
written from, and a list of green test names with no reasons beside them is a
list nobody can read back.

| law | file | was red because | landed in |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Green before the work started, so that the set was never vacuous:
`TestEveryRoleWaitsForABoundedTime`, `TestTheControllerIsBuiltFromTheOneFactory`,
`TestEveryStreamingRoleIsBoundedAndMediaIsNot`.

And one law the integration lane added, because the finding it holds was found
rather than designed: `TestEveryTransportBoundSitsAboveTheCeilingTheControllerActsAt`
(`internal/provider/streamguard_ceiling_test.go`). Decision 10 says the
transport's bounds are the LAST resort; they were not. A mid-stream gap derived
at fifteen seconds pre-empted the thirty- and sixty-second ceilings of every
unattended role, so for most of this build's calls the first thing to act on a
stall was the one act that throws the whole attempt away. The bounds are scaled
by the role's patience now and floored at twice its ceiling, and the law walks
every role in the table at every rate the derivation can be handed.

## L. The wall bounds a reply that is not working, never a reply that is long

*Added 2026-09-10, against `dev@996117314`.* The transport's stream wall
(`internal/provider/streamguard.go`, "THE WALL") is the one bound in the clock
table that measured *length* rather than *silence*, and it was blind to whether
the stream was working.

### The evidence

A task on `moonshotai/kimi-k3` asked for one self-contained HTML file (the
existing one is 33 KB, about 9k tokens; the model was going for more). It ran
twenty minutes and produced nothing. From its event log and the reconciled
`usage.jsonl` rows:

| attempt | lane | ran | output streamed before the cut | journal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | DigitalOcean | 2m30s | 5,510 tok (~37 tok/s, steady) | `the reply ran past 2m30s without finishing and was cut` |
| 2 | DeepInfra | 2m30s | 3,576 tok (~24 tok/s, steady) | same |
| 3 | Morph | 10m39s | 26,145 tok (~41 tok/s, steady) | `the reply ran past 10m39s without finishing and was cut` |
| hedge arm during 3 | – | – | 18,233 tok, discarded | `hedge_waste_usd` 0.30 |

$1.46 of the task's $1.74 was discarded output. Every cut reply was streaming
at its lane's normal rate the whole time, and the error rows carried no token
count.

### Three causes, all in code

1. **The wall was blind to progress.** It was a pure elapsed-time timer at five
   times the longest reply the lane had *completed*, floored at 2m30s once the
   lane had any history. This lane had only finished 5–9 second tool-call
   turns, so its wall was 2m30s — at 40 tok/s a hard cap of about 6k output
   tokens. A 9k-token write can never fit, and the retry ran the identical
   request into the identical wall.
2. **A tool-call fragment was hidden.** The read loop called a delta visible
   only when it carried answer text, so a `write` streaming its arguments was
   reported to the controller as a run of thought. The phase never left
   `PhaseThinking`; the duration clock measured ten minutes of writing against
   how long this model *thinks*, called it pathological, and raised a rescue arm
   that wrote 18k tokens nobody kept. The cut's `Tokens` counted answer text
   only, so the row said zero.
3. **The wall could only learn from a completed reply,** and a lane whose wall
   is too short to complete a long reply never completes one. This is cause 1
   seen from the ledger's side and needs no mechanism of its own: once a stream
   keeping pace is not cut, it completes, `noteRun` records it, and the next
   wall is derived from it.

### The law

**A tool-call argument is the answer arriving.** It is `Reading.Visible`, it
moves the phase to writing, and it counts in the cut's `Tokens` — as does
thought, because the cut's figure is the stream wall's own count of everything
the model wrote, the same estimate (`tokensOf`, four bytes a token) the rest of
the adapter rates with, and comparable with the provider's output count, which
includes reasoning. Thought stays hidden to the controller because a rescue
would not have to repeat it for anybody; a call's arguments are exactly what a
rescue would have to write again. The one-voice rule counts a call forming on
the screen as the answer being read (`hedge.go`'s `shown`), so a rescue's first
call fragment cannot take the voice from a speaker whose own call is on screen.

**When the wall fires, it asks whether the stream kept pace before it cuts.** The
tokens delivered over the period the wall was armed for — measured from the
first write, then from each re-arm — are compared with what the lane's own
measured rate would have produced over that period. At least a fifth, and the
wall re-arms for another period; less, and the stream is cut exactly as before,
with the same sentence, whose figure is the whole bound the timer reached. The
re-arm never passes `streamWallCeiling` (20 minutes), which stays absolute.

**The fifth is `streamWallFactor`, not a new number.** The factor was argued
from the spread between healthy replies — three or four to one, with a reply
that will never end an order of magnitude off — and the same spread bounds a
rate: load, decoding deep into a long context and bursty delivery move a lane's
rate by less than that, and a drip is ten or a hundred times under it. The
controller's own "keeping up" test (`hazard.go`, the decayed sum of gap
deviates) was considered and not reused: over thousands of tokens it would
condemn a stream running 20% under its lane's median, which is right for
gating credit toward a ten-second ceiling and wrong for a cut that throws the
whole attempt away.

**A lane with no measured rate is held to `LagRate`** (30 tok/s, so six a
second): the one rate this process already asserts about every endpoint, the
line under which a finished reply is called slow. Every healthy lane measured
here clears six a second, so a stranger's long reply is re-armed and a
stranger's drip is caught at its first wall exactly as before. The stream's own
first-period rate was the alternative and it is wrong: a drip measured against
itself keeps pace with itself and would run to the ceiling. This covers
`routing off` too, where the rate ledger is not kept.

**The rule is strictly more patient than the one it replaces.** Every stream the
old wall cut is cut at the same moment or re-armed; nothing is cut earlier. A
completion that is not streamed keeps its hard wall — there is nothing to
measure pace with until it is over.

### Alternatives considered and rejected

- **Bound by output tokens instead of time.** Some routes deliberately send no
  `max_tokens` (`document.go`, `relaxMaxTokens`), and the request's token room
  already bounds a count where one is sent. The failure the wall exists for is a
  drip — a *rate* — and a count bound catches a drip only after it has dripped
  the whole budget, which at a token a second is hours. Pace is the honest
  measurement of the thing that is wrong.
- **Raise `streamWallMeasuredFloor`.** A band-aid. The floor would be a new
  guess about the longest honest reply, the chicken-and-egg would stay, and a
  slower lane or a bigger file would hit it tomorrow. Rejected.
- **Push the wall on every chunk.** Already rejected in the file: a wall a
  chunk can push is not a wall, and a drip is made of chunks. The pace re-arm is
  different in kind — no chunk moves it; it is re-derived once per period from a
  measurement over the whole period, and it cannot pass the ceiling. A drip
  cannot buy a second period however many tokens it sends.
- **Carry the partial `write` across the cut** (salvage, or the continuation
  hedge). Out of scope here, and still owed on this road: a stream-wall cut on
  the chat road still throws the reply away whole. The seams are
  `hedgeRace.flip` (the continuation hedge `hedge.go` already names) and
  `internal/session/salvage.go` (the output-limit salvage). The structuring
  slots' call wall — a different wall, one completion under a fixed four
  minutes — keeps what it cut since issue #927; §M says how, and why it could
  not be done by handing the partial back through the provider.

Also owed, and small: a thought is folded back into the model's thinking
distribution only when the first word of *text* ends it (`client.go`'s
`lanes.NoteThought`), so a turn that thinks and then calls a tool teaches the
duration clock nothing. Closing the thought on the first call fragment is the
same law, but it re-announces `StreamThinking` on interleaved turns and was left
for a change that can check every surface's reading of that event.

## M. The call wall is told, and keeps what was thought (issue #927)

The structuring slots — the one that talks and the one that plans, on the
resident and on `codeaf do` — bound every completion at
`pool.DefaultCallWall`, four minutes. §L's stream wall bounds a reply that is
not working; this one bounds a completion that is working and has run out of
time, and until #927 it did two things wrong.

### What was true

- **The model was never told.** No planning call carried a reasoning knob:
  `config.Config.Context` sends `WithConfiguredReasoningEffort(ctx,
  c.Reasoning)`, and the default is `provider.EffortNone`. GLM 5.3 runs at its
  published default — `max` — when nothing is sent, so an open-ended grounding
  prompt on a long request thought for the whole four minutes on one machine
  and answered in 2.3 s with 16 reasoning tokens on another, inside the same
  run. Which side of the wall a call landed on was luck.
- **The cut kept nothing.** `walled.CompleteWithMessages` returned `nil,
  ErrCallWall`, and nothing above could have done better: a raced call's
  `hedgeRace.abandon` returns the caller's deadline and nothing else, so the
  partial response in `client.go`'s decode-error branch never reaches anyone.
  Four minutes of billed thought became `output: None`.
- **The command rail cut honest work.** `resident.commandWall` was ten
  minutes, argued as twice the worst honest case. Both of #927's strikes were
  that rail, not the call wall: compile 225 s, grounding to the wall, spine to
  165 s, and a fan-out still running at ten minutes. The receipt then said
  `the model stopped answering twice`, which was the one account of the
  event that was false — every first token arrived in under a second.

### What is true now

- **The wall is told** (`provider.WithThinkingWall`, `effortladder.go`). Every
  walled completion carries its wall to the effort ladder, which derives a
  thinking budget for a pass nobody else sized: `share(level) × believed rate ×
  wall`. The rate is the lane belief the waiting controller plans against
  (`lanes.PaceFor`), read for the machine the request asked for — or the
  slowest the sheet lists, when it asked for none — and only for a pair the
  ledger actually holds; the share is the router's documented allocation of a
  ceiling to thinking at that level (`thinkingShare`). A word somebody chose
  stands; a rung's own budget yields only to a smaller wall; a model that
  thinks only when asked is not asked. The budget rides the level the pass
  runs at anyway, and the call log names it `max within 4m0s` rather than by
  its count, so the thinking-duration belief keyed on that string stays one key.
- **The wall told is the one that binds** (`walled.allowance`). A completion
  runs under the slot's wall or its share of the caller's own deadline,
  whichever is shorter, and that one figure is both what cuts it and what the
  model is told. The first completion's share is half of what the caller has
  left (`completionsPerCall`), so the answer ask always has the other half: a
  late round of a command whose rail is nearly spent is cut by its wall, and
  asked, rather than by the rail, and lost.
- **Any clock's cut keeps what was thought**, not only the wall's. The wall is
  one of three timers over a structuring completion: the dispatcher gives each
  attempt its own patience (§A's `control.Plan.Deadline`, from
  `lane.Role.GiveUp`) and the stream guard bounds a quiet stream (§L). Issue
  #927's second run lost its size, bind and contract passes at 51 seconds, not
  at four minutes, with the thought as lost as if the wall had taken it. So
  `walled.completion` asks whether TIME ended the completion — a deadline
  however wrapped, or a `provider.StreamCut` read through `provider.CutFrom` —
  and never which timer did. The wall names only its own cut; any other clock's
  error is handed back as it came, because it already says what stopped the
  call and a second account of one event is how a receipt starts lying.
- **The wall keeps what was thought** (`pool.walled`, `kept`). The partial is
  collected where it demonstrably exists — the stream events the completion
  raised while it was writing — by an observer that forwards every event
  unchanged to whoever the caller had listening. A completion that reaches its
  wall with thought or answer on the wire is asked ONCE more: the caller's
  messages, the thought, any answer it had begun and any tool call it had
  begun writing (as words, never as a call) as the assistant's turn, and an
  answer ask, with
  thinking switched off (required, so a seat's pin cannot re-open it) and the
  request's own shape still on. Only when that ask also fails is the caller
  given `ErrCallWall`. A completion that wrote nothing is not asked again —
  there is nothing to answer from, and a retry is the layer above's.
- **The rail is counted in calls** (`resident.commandWall = spliceRounds ×
  pool.LongestCall`): five sequential structuring rounds of a splice, each at
  most a completion and its answer ask. The receipt names the cause: `the model
  thought past its time`.

### Why not a second salvage path

The owner's constraint was one mechanism. There was no cut salvage on any road
to reuse (§L's bullet above), and the ones that look like it are different
shapes: `shaped`'s continuation repairs an object cut at the output limit, from
a response that exists; `session/salvage.go` repairs a severed tool call's
arguments. The wall's partial exists only as a stream, so it is kept at the
one layer that both hears the stream and knows the wall fired, and every
walled caller — the compiler, every plan pass, briefs, the head — gets it
without a line of its own.

### Laws

`pool`'s `TestEveryCompletionThroughAWallIsToldItsWall` (a walled completion is
sent from `walled.completion` alone, and that function carries the wall);
`plan`'s `TestPlanningReachesAModelOnlyThroughTheClientItIsHanded` (planning
and the compiler build no client of their own, so every planning call goes
through the wall it was handed). And the door itself:
`cmd/codeaf`'s `TestAPlanningModelThatThinksPastItsWallStillPlans` runs
`codeaf do --json` against a compiler that never stops thinking and asserts the
budget on the first body, the thought on the second, a settled run and no
`stopped answering`. `TestEveryPlanningStageThatThinksPastItsWallStillPlans` is
the same door with every pass of the pipeline — compile, ground, spine, fan-out,
size, bind, audit, contracts — served by that model, and asks all three
questions of each; the control runs the same pipeline answering in time and
finds each pass asked exactly once. The clocks UNDER the wall are proved at the
pool layer instead (`TestAThoughtCutByAClockUnderTheWallIsAskedForToo`,
`TestAStreamTheGuardGaveUpOnKeepsItsThought`), with the error shapes the
dispatcher's patience and the stream guard really leave: no stub can make a
45-second silence bound fire in a test that finishes in seconds.

### The cause is said once

`pool.RanOutOfTime` is the phrase, and `pool.CauseInWords` is the one door every
sentence carrying it goes through. A planning fault used to reach a person as
`the plan for task-2 was drawn with faults (size stage 1: context deadline
exceeded)`; the composer keeps the pass — which is what the person's next
decision uses — and replaces the machinery with the cause the receipt names.
`internal/resident`'s receipt and stage note read the same constant rather than
a second copy of it.

### Still owed

Issue #927's third fix: the grounding, spine and fan-out prompts state the depth
the question warrants, in the same sentence that states the answer's shape. It
is not here because it changes what every planning pass is told on every
request, which is a change to the quality of plans and has to be measured
against the planning bench before it lands, not argued into a fix for a wall.
The wall's budget bounds the thinking; it does not choose it.

## What this deliberately does not do

- **It does not race every lane on every request.** Three to five arms is three
  to five times the bill for a p50 the hedge already captures at about 2%.
  `maxArms` is what bounds arms, and since 2026-09-11 it is the ONLY thing that
  counts them. The purse bounds MONEY, out of the call's own budget, and in
  practice it refuses only an arm dearer than the whole wait it would buy back.
- **It does not add a second escalation ladder.** `Escalate` hands the wait to
  the one that exists. A controller that changed a model would be answering a
  person's question with a model nobody chose for it.
- **It does not fit a diurnal term**, and §C says what would change that.
- **It does not touch the transport's bounds.** Rows 10–18 of the clock table
  stay exactly where they are: they are the last resort for the case where no
  action is possible at all, and every one of them is deliberately far past
  every one of the controller's. (§L changed what the stream wall does when it
  fires — it asks whether the stream kept pace — and none of its figures.)
- **It does not make `routing off` wait on a policy.** A person who asked for no
  steering gets none — and the ceiling still applies, because a ceiling is not
  steering. What it can do at the ceiling is `Report`, and nothing else.
