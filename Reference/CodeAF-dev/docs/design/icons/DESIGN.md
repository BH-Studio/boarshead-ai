# Icons — one vocabulary, three tiers, one door

Owner ruling 2026-09-09. Every mark a person sees in **every surface package**
comes from ONE table, in whichever of three spellings their terminal can draw.
This page is the copy of record: the law, the table as it landed, and how to add
a mark.

**Scope: every surface package.** `internal/tui3` (the live chat),
`internal/tui` (v1, and the visual north star), `internal/head` and
`internal/resident` (the resident). It landed covering `internal/tui3` alone,
which left the other three free to spell marks for themselves — and v1 did, with
its own dotted circle for work waiting on a sibling, its own cross for failure,
and its own flag for work waiting on a PERSON, which is the character this table
keeps for the other kind of waiting. `internal/iconlaw` walks all four on one
list now, and a fifth surface joins the law by being added to that list.

## The law

1. **One vocabulary.** `internal/tui2/tokens` holds every mark: the task states,
   the action families in the step gutter, the chrome, the prose slots. A
   surface holds the map from ITS meanings to slots and nothing else.
2. **Three tiers, one door.** `tokens.GlyphSet.Glyph(id)` resolves a slot:
   `NerdFont` (a Font Awesome 4 icon), `Plain` (the geometric floor every
   terminal draws), `ASCII` (one character a screen reader can name). Flipping
   the tier moves no column — every spelling on every side measures one cell
   under both shipping rulers, and `glyph_test.go` proves it rather than
   assuming it.
3. **Never a literal in a surface.** A mark spelled as a character draws the
   plain floor forever, because a literal cannot know which repertoire the
   terminal is on. That is not a style point: it is how a person with a patched
   font came to see proper icons beside their tool calls and bare geometric
   shapes beside their tasks. `internal/iconlaw`'s
   `TestNoSurfaceSpellsAnIconItself` fails the build on one, in any surface
   package, and it runs on every pull request through `make test-laws`. Its one
   carve-out is `resident.NoteMark`: a job-board note is written with `⚑` and
   read back by prefix, so that byte is a PROTOCOL byte in the journal rather
   than a cell on a screen, and routing it through the tier would make stored
   bytes depend on the terminal that wrote them.
   `TestEveryExemptionIsStillReal` fails if that carve-out ever stops naming a
   real line.
4. **The shape says the state, with no colour.** Two readings may not share a
   cell in any tier. The roster is read by people who have turned colour off and
   by people who cannot see it; a vocabulary that needed its hues would have
   nothing to say to either. Hue is a second, independent axis (`tierInk`).
5. **Font Awesome 4 addresses only.** Those codepoints have sat still since Nerd
   Fonts v1 and are in every patched font, including a Powerline-only patch.
   `nf-md-*` (Material) is refused outright: Nerd Fonts v3 moved the whole set
   into plane 15, where a v2-era patched font has nothing. The NAME is the
   contract and the codepoint is a binding, verified against the pinned
   `testdata/nerdfont_glyphnames.json`.
6. **The ban list is measured, not argued.** `tokens.BannedGlyphs` refuses
   anything wider than one cell, anything in the emoji planes, anything carrying
   a variation selector, the media-control pictographs (`⏸ ⏵ ⏹`), the
   hourglasses, and the powerline separators. A rune not on the list still has
   to pass the ruler.
7. **The tier is chosen once, and one terminal shows one tier everywhere.**
   `tokens.DetectGlyphSet` vetoes the terminals and locales that cannot be
   trusted with private use — no `TERM`, `TERM=linux`, Apple Terminal, a CJK
   locale, legacy conhost — and the Display row (`step icons`: `auto` · `rich` ·
   `plain`, read with `config.IconsAt`) is the person's own say. Every surface
   folds the same two facts the same way:

   | Surface | Folds them in | Draws through | Detects at |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | `internal/tui3` | `app.iconSet` | `palette.glyph`, `app.icon` | `newApp` |
   | `internal/tui` | `Model.iconSet` (icons.go) | `Model.icon` | `RunWithCommander` |

   v3's ASCII tier is `palette.ascii`'s answer, set by the linear screen-reader
   option; v1 has no linear option, so it resolves `Plain` or `NerdFont` and the
   third tier reaches it the day it grows one. v1 detects **at the door that
   opens a real terminal** rather than at construction, so a window an embedder
   or a test builds keeps the designed plain floor — the tier is on by default
   for anything `DetectGlyphSet` cannot rule out, and a suite that detected would
   assert against private-use codepoints it cannot print.
   `internal/head` and `internal/resident` draw no marks of their own at all
   (their one `⚑` is the protocol byte above), so they hold no tier: they are on
   the law's list to keep it that way.

## The table as it landed

### Task states (internal/tui3/tasktier.go's `tierSlot`)

| State | Slot | Plain | Nerd font | ASCII |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| queued, auto-starts in Ns | `GQueued` | `○` | nf-fa-circle_o | `o` |
| waiting on task N / on the machine | `GWaitsOn` | `⚑` | nf-fa-flag | `!` |
| working, finishing | `GWorking` | `◐` | nf-fa-adjust | `*` |
| done | `GSettled` | `✓` | nf-fa-check | `+` |
| stopped by the person | `GStopped` | `■` | nf-fa-stop | `/` |
| incomplete | `GFailed` | `✕` | nf-fa-times | `x` |
| your call | `GNeedsHuman` | `?` | nf-fa-question_circle_o | `?` |
| paused at the cap | `GPaused` | `=` | nf-fa-pause | `=` |

A live row draws the braille spinner instead of the working mark, on the one
shared animation clock — that is the surface's promise that something is
happening THIS INSTANT, and it is why a redrawn-on-change page (the roster, the
record) wears the still mark instead. The linear tier never animates.

### Action families (internal/tui3/actionicon.go's `actionMarks`)

| Family | Slot | Plain | Nerd font | ASCII |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| search | `GSearch` | `⌕` | nf-fa-search | `?` |
| read | `GActionRead` | `▤` | nf-fa-file_text_o | `<` |
| edit | `GWrite` | `✎` | nf-fa-pencil | `*` |
| create | `GActionCreate` | `+` | nf-fa-plus | `+` |
| run | `GShell` | `$` | nf-fa-terminal | `$` |
| test | `GActionTest` | `◎` | nf-fa-flask | `!` |
| browse | `GActionBrowse` | `↗` | nf-fa-globe | `^` |
| transfer | `GActionTransfer` | `⇄` | nf-fa-exchange | `&` |
| communicate | `GActionCommunicate` | `»` | nf-fa-comment | `@` |
| coordinate | `GActionCoordinate` | `⇉` | nf-fa-code_fork | `\|` |
| plan | `GActionPlan` | `≡` | nf-fa-tasks | `#` |
| wait | `GActionWait` | `◷` | nf-fa-clock_o | `,` |
| work (the bucket) | `GActionWork` | `▪` | nf-fa-cog | `.` |

The gutter says what family a step is and NEVER how it went: `test` draws a
flask and never a checkmark, because the family is the act of checking and not
its verdict.

### Attachment action

| Meaning | Slot | Plain | Nerd font | ASCII |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| remove an unsent attachment | `GRemove` | `×` | nf-fa-times_circle | `x` |

The dim action mark is distinct from the failed-work mark. It is drawn only where
a click can remove the attachment, and is resolved explicitly through the vocabulary.

### Conversation compaction

| Meaning | Slot | Plain | Nerd font | ASCII |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| working context shortened | `GCompacted` | `⚭` | nf-fa-compress | `#` |

The Font Awesome 4 `fa-compress` mark is U+F066. Both the automatic pass line and
the `/compact` reply resolve this slot through the chat surface's glyph door.

### File kinds (chips, and the gutter beside a call that made or opened one)

| Kind | Slot | Plain | Nerd font | ASCII |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a document — a page of text | `GFileDocument` | `▤` | nf-fa-file_text | `d` |
| an image | `GFileImage` | `⌾` | nf-fa-file_image_o | `i` |
| a sound | `GFileAudio` | `♪` | nf-fa-file_audio_o | `a` |
| a moving picture | `GFileVideo` | `▷` | nf-fa-file_video_o | `v` |

Four kinds, and the set is closed because it is the set a person can hand this
program and the set this program can hand back. A KIND IS NOT AN ACTION: the
step gutter's families say what a call was DOING, these say what the thing on the
end of the path IS, which is why `generate_video` and a dragged-in `.mp4` draw
the same mark. They are one block rather than four scattered slots for the
reason the block exists at all: a row of chips that upgraded three kinds and left
the fourth on the plain floor would draw the exact mixed-repertoire line the tier
was built to end.

`GFileDocument` is `GActionRead`'s byte AND its icon on purpose — a page of text
is a page of text whether a call opened it or a person dragged it in — and
`glyphvocab_test.go`'s named-exceptions table carries the pair. The video mark is
the OUTLINE triangle and not the filled `▶` a chip used to spell: the filled one
is `GQueuePill`'s, and one plain glyph may upgrade exactly one way.

### Destinations

| Meaning | Slot | Plain | Nerd font | ASCII |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| where the next thing goes | `GTarget` | `→` | — (geometry) | `→` |

One mark, added 2026-09-09 for home's rule
(`→ new conversation in ~/src/parser · glm-5.3-flash`, internal/tui3's
homedraft.go). It is the only mark in the table about a **destination** rather
than a state, and it is deliberately neither `GScopeUp` (a header pointing back
up a tree) nor `GPromptSteer` (a composer's own prompt).

It is **geometry**: an arrow is already the right character for a grid, and a
Font Awesome arrow would buy nothing and spend a private-use codepoint. Note the
consequence, because it is the one cost of taking a character this common —
U+2192 is now a vocabulary byte, so `internal/tui2/modelui/result.go` needed the
first entry the `literalExemptions` list has had in a while (a `String()` for a
log line). `internal/tui3` is held by its own `iconLawRunes` map, which
deliberately does NOT claim `→`: a dozen hint strings on that surface spell it as
the name of the **right arrow key** (`→ verbs`, `→ opens`, `→ lanes`), which is a
key and not a mark, and a gate that failed on those would be a gate people learn
to ignore.

The rest of the vocabulary — disclosure, prompts, the place line, the status
line, the spawn tree, the gauges, the prose slots — is in
`internal/tui2/tokens/nerdfont.go`, one binding each, with its argument at its
own binding.

The prompt family is four slots: the questions wave
(`docs/design/questions/DESIGN.md`) made it three, because an exchange has two voices in
it, and the queue made it four on 2026-09-30:

| Meaning | Slot | Plain | Nerd font | ASCII |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| the composer, chat | `GPromptChat` | `›` | geometry | `›` |
| the composer, a steer line | `GPromptSteer` | `↦` | geometry | `↦` |
| the answer to a question put back to the asker | `GReplyIn` | `↳` | geometry | `↳` |
| a message queued for after the current turn (`ctrl+enter`) | `GFollowUp` | `↳` | geometry | `↳` |

`GReplyIn` is deliberately not `GPromptChat`: `›` is the person typing and `↳` is
what came back, and a page that drew both with one mark would make an exchange
unreadable at exactly the moment it matters. `GFollowUp` is deliberately not
`GQueued`: the circle is a task waiting its turn, and a queued message drawn with it
reads as work it is not. It shares `↳` with `GReplyIn` by position — the reply mark is
drawn only under a question in its room, the queue mark only above the message box —
and `TestOneGlyphOneMeaning` carries that argument. All four are punctuation rather than pictographs, so they
are geometry and neither tier swaps the byte.

### What a question is doing (`docs/design/questions/DESIGN.md`)

| Meaning | Slot | Plain | Nerd font | ASCII |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| it is waiting on you | `GNeedsHuman` | `?` | nf-fa-question_circle_o | `?` |
| it took something for granted and went on | `GAssumed` | `≈` | nf-fa-lightbulb_o | `~` |
| it did the reversible thing and is telling you | `GSettled` | `✓` | nf-fa-check | `+` |
| it no longer needs answering | `GWithdrawn` | `⊘` | nf-fa-ban | `-` |
| the answer your enter takes | `GPointer` | `▸` | *(geometry — same byte)* | *(the question draws `>`)* |
| the asker's pick | `GRecommended` | `◆` | nf-fa-star_o | `*` |
| the question of several the panel is showing | `GTabHere` | `●` | nf-fa-circle | `@` |
| a question of several still waiting for its answer | `GTabOpen` | `○` | nf-fa-circle_o | `o` |

The two tab slots are for several questions one step raised, drawn as one
panel with a tab each (`internal/tui3/questionset.go`): `●` is the tab the panel
is showing, `○` one still waiting, and a question already answered in the set
wears `GSettled`. They share their plain bytes with the plan's step dots, and the
test that allows that says why (`TestOneGlyphOneMeaning`).

And the ONE frame a question hangs in (`internal/tui3/frame.go`, owner ruling
2026-09-11): `GFrameTopLeft` `╭`, `GFrameTopRight` `╮`, `GFrameBottomLeft` `╰`,
`GFrameBottomRight` `╯`, `GFrameEdge` `─`, `GFrameSide` `│` — geometry, so no
tier touches them, and on a terminal refused box drawing the frame draws its own
ASCII run: two plain rules of `-` and no sides. The `/folder` chooser, the
`ctrl+k` switcher card and the onboarding panel are drawn by the same frame, and
the rounded corners are owned runes (`internal/iconlaw`), so no surface can spell
a fifth box of its own.

**Of the first four, only the first is amber** — and the pointer and the pick
are amber too, because they are the question's own marks (colour pick C: the
marks carry the hue and every word is ink). That is the reason there are four
state slots rather than one. An assumptions card, a ratify line and a withdrawn line are all things
the asker has already decided; drawing any of them with the attention mark tells
a person to answer something that is not asking them anything, which is how the
one hue that means "waiting on you" stops meaning it. `GAssumed` and `GWithdrawn`
are tertiary and `GSettled` keeps its own green.

The tier has no icon for `≈`: `nf-md-approximately_equal` is a plane-15 address
and B.2 refuses those, so `GAssumed` is the one binding in the table whose two
sides are the same MEANING rather than the same shape — the mathematical
spelling on the floor, the asker's own idea on the tier.

## Adding a mark

1. Declare the constant in `glyph.go` and add it to `Glyphs()`. That list IS the
   width gate; a constant missing from it escapes every ruler.
2. Add a `GlyphID` in `glyphset.go` and a binding in `nerdfont.go` with
   `Plain`, `NerdFont`, `NFName`, `ASCII`, `UsualTint` and the ambiguity flags.
   A slot that is line GEOMETRY (a rail, a tree corner, a gauge step) takes
   `Geometry: true` and no icon: box drawing is already the right character for
   a grid, and an icon there would be strictly worse.
3. Add its Nerd Fonts name and code to `testdata/nerdfont_glyphnames.json` if it
   is not there. The provenance gate checks the name against the pinned release.
4. Run `go test ./internal/tui2/tokens/`. It will tell you if the mark is two
   cells anywhere, if it is banned, if it duplicates a meaning, if its ambiguity
   flags are wrong, if a non-ASCII slot forgot to auto-upgrade, or if the icon
   is outside BMP private use.
5. Draw it through `palette.glyph(id)` or `app.icon(id)`. Never as a character.

## What v1 was drawing before

The window kept as the visual north star had five marks of its own, and two of
them contradicted the table:

| v1 drew | For | Now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `◌` | a pending node waiting on a sibling | `GWaitsOn` — `⚑`, the mark every other surface already used for that reading |
| `⚑` | a card or brief row waiting on a PERSON | `GNeedsHuman` — `?`, which is what the flag was standing in the way of |
| `✗` | failure, in five places | `GFailed` — `✕` |
| `–` | cancelled, so it would not read as broken | `GStopped` — `■`, which says stopped-by-the-person outright |
| `⚙ $ ✎ ⌕ ⌾ ♪ ▶ ▤` | the tool-call gutter in the activity feed | the action-family and file-kind slots, the bucket on `GActionWork` (whose icon is the cog it was spelling) |

Its hues did not move: the mint, rose, peach and butter styles under every call
site are exactly what they were, because hue is a second, independent axis.

## What this replaced

Before this wave the chat had three vocabularies. `internal/tui2/tokens` held
one; `internal/tui3/actionicon.go` held a private three-tier table with ten
private-use codepoints spelled inline; and the task states were seven constants
scattered over six files with an ASCII twin beside each. They disagreed, and the
disagreement was visible: a stopped task drew `⊘` on the roster and `✗` on its
own page, a run held at its spend gate drew the banned `⏸`, and the fold mark
`▸` and the working mark were the same character on the page that used both.
