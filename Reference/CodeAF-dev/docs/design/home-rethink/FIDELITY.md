# Design fidelity — the owner's order: follow the exact design

2026-08-25, the owner: "follow the exact design please." This overrules the softened choices in
LANES.md decisions 3 and 5. This retained fidelity record is the authority; where the recorded
screens disagreed, turn 2 (2a–2f) and turn 3 (3a–3e) win over turn 1. Deviations survive
only where the mechanism is physically impossible or the fact does not exist — each such case is
listed at the bottom and stays flagged to the owner.

## The checklist a fidelity lane executes

1. **Palette — the exact tokens hexes on home and every place.** ~~The design quotes
   `internal/tui2/tokens/palette.go`: text tiers `#E6E6F0` / `#A0A6BB` / `#7C8296`; amber `#EECE96`
   = needs a human; cyan `#A4D7EA` = alive; green `#A2E2BC` = money; selection band `#262633`;
   ground `#12121A` as the painted page ground of these surfaces. The tui3-local laws in
   `designlanguage_test.go` are ADJUSTED DELIBERATELY for the place surfaces in the same commit.
   `hueMoney` becomes exactly `#A2E2BC`; needs-a-human on places becomes exactly `#EECE96`.~~

2. **The pulse, exactly screen 2b/3b:** `codeaf` left; right: `2 want you · 4 moving ·
   $0.55 / $20.00 · tue 1:11pm` — the words `want you` and `moving`, the allowance as a fraction,
   each clause absent at zero (1c: a quiet morning is `codeaf` and the clock alone).
3. **Hints and feet, word for word:** home at rest `type to search or start something new · ↑↓ pick
   · enter open · tab next place`; with the composer `enter talk about it · alt+enter send it off
   as a task · alt+. for the map · tab next place`; each place's foot as its screen spells it
   (1e, 2d, 2f, 2c). The tab bar words lowercase, counts as bare numbers after the word.
4. **Glyph per state, everywhere:** `?` NeedsHuman (amber) — the switcher must not use `▲`;
   `◐` working (cyan), `○` queued, `✓` settled, `✕` failed, `▸` collapsed/fold, `›` prompt,
   `·` a memory line's bullet.
5. **Memory (1f/2d):** `enter` on a LINE is `ask me about it` — it opens a conversation seeded
   with that line (the card moves behind `→`); `enter` on a shelf opens the shelf. The foot spells
   1f: `enter ask me about it · e fix the wording · f forget it · tab next place`.
6. **Standing rope — three states, screen 2f:** the run history the item already keeps
   (`Runs`, `LastOutcome`, the sentinel lines) derives the middle state: no grant → **asks first**;
   grant present but fewer than 5 clean firings → **earning trust 3/5** (clean = fired with no
   `needsPerson` and no failure); grant present and ≥5 clean → **trusted alone**. Spelling uses
   *trust*, not *tenure* — the resident-separation test bans that word; the mechanism is exact.
7. **Spend roles (2c):** the role column is "the role it was bound to" — join each model against
   the CURRENT crew bindings (`config.ModelSlots`), exactly as the caption says; `planning` with no
   binding draws `unbound · follows execution` (`config.ModelSlotFor`). Not per-call attribution —
   the design itself asks for the binding.
8. **The card at ≥160 (1d), five bands in the design's order and wording:** title; place line
   `~/codeaf · master, 1 file dirty · here`; `it is stopped on you` + the question + its answer
   keys; `work` rows with `✓ … $1.63` and `▸ 3 more tasks` naming the tasks place; `made for you`
   with the path; the facts line `spent $1.63 · 3.6M tokens · thinking high`; then `→ verbs: …`.
9. **Composer 2e, exactly:** the page behind dims to the faintest tier; the three lines are
   `· in ~/codeaf, on master` (`alt+w to move it`), `· execution runs on opus 4.1`
   (`alt+o to change`), `· it may spend up to $2.00 before it asks` (`type a number`); the lead line
   `it will run on its own and tell you when it lands` with `a task` right-flushed; foot
   `alt+enter send it off · enter talk about it first · esc back to <place>`.
10. **Screen 3d:** the window label between the arrows is the control and the reading
    (`shift+← aug 12 – aug 25 →` drawn in the header), grain zoom on `shift+↑↓`, the same pair on
    tasks, standing (when it fired) and memory (when it was learned) — memory and standing get
    `placeWindow` too.

## Type and ground — what the design specifies, and what a terminal can honour

What the design file set, as recorded here before it was removed: `font-family: 'JetBrains Mono',
ui-monospace, Menlo, monospace`,
weights **400 and 700 only** (71 bold spans — bold is the tier-1 device), body 14px at 21px line
height; the small 11.5px runs are the canvas's own captions, not screen content. Mockup grounds:
`#12121A` page ground (18 blocks), `#262633` selection band (25), `#E6E6F0` three inverted chips,
`#0a0a0e` only the canvas behind the artboards. No italics anywhere in the mockups.

11. **Font — recommend, verify, never pretend.** A TUI cannot set the terminal's font. So:
    (a) the manual (`screen.md`, and the first-run page) states the design font plainly —
    *"codeaf is drawn for JetBrains Mono, regular and bold; any monospace with the block and
    box-drawing ranges works"* — with one line on where to set it in iTerm2/Terminal.app/kitty/
    alacritty/ghostty; (b) every glyph a place draws must render in JetBrains Mono, Menlo, SF Mono
    and DejaVu Sans Mono — audit the place surfaces against `tokens/glyph.go` slots (all current
    slots are standard ranges; keep it that way — nothing from nerd-font private use on places);
    (c) the existing capability floors stay live on places: `DetectGlyphSet`'s plain-ASCII floor
    and `detectASCII`'s veto must produce a legible place at TERM=linux and NO_COLOR — add the
    every-place-at-the-plain-floor test.
12. **Weight and style discipline, from the file itself:** bold marks tier 1 (the subject, the
    selected tab word, a key name in a hint) and nothing else; **no italics on any place** (the
    design uses none); no third weight exists, so emphasis beyond bold is brightness, case, indent
    or air (screen 2a) — never underline (links/OSC 8 excepted where the codebase already does).
    One font size: the 11.5px captions map to the dim tier, not to a smaller face.
13. **Ground — paint it, exactly, scoped.** ~~Home and the places paint `#12121A` as their page
    ground and `#262633` as the selection band, at TrueColor as authored and at ANSI256 as the
    nearest cube indexes; the NoColor/plain profile paints no ground at all. `styles.go`'s "rest is
    not a colour" comment block and the `TestOnlyTheGroundLadderPaintsABackground` law are UPDATED
    DELIBERATELY: the place ground joins the ladder as its floor step.~~

14. **Terminal adaptation checks:** ~~the first-run note (and `screen.md`) carries the design's own
    open item — macOS terminals need "use option as meta" for the `alt` class; say which setting,
    per terminal, and what `esc`-prefix behaviour looks like when it is off.~~

    > **LANDED, and it grew two halves the checklist did not ask for** (`internal/tui3/chords.go`).
    > A TUI cannot see whether Option is meta — it sees what the emulator sent — so the item is
    > three separate mechanisms rather than one:
    >
    > - **One spelling.** `chordSpelling`, from `runtime.GOOS` plus a `tokens.Env` closure. On
    >   macOS the modifier is drawn `⌥` (`⌥1`…`⌥7`, `⌥.`, `⌥enter`, `⌥g`, `⌥q`, `⌥s`, `⌥w`, `⌥o`);
    >   everywhere else `alt+`. Every constant stays authored `alt+` — which is what the manual
    >   quotes and the gates grep for — and `chordSpelling.say` substitutes at the one drawing door.
    > - **A second encoding where the terminal reports one.** `ctrl+1`…`ctrl+7` and `ctrl+.`, bound
    >   off `app.keysDisambiguated` — the terminal's own reply to the kitty-keyboard query, which
    >   bargein.go already spends on `shift+enter` — and never off an environment guess. The map's
    >   line names the alias exactly when it is live, so it is never a phantom.
    > - **The check itself.** `app.chordWatch` reads every key: a Mac that sends `¡ ™ £ ¢ ∞ § ¶ ≥
    >   © œ ß ∑ ø ∫ ƒ` where a bound chord was aimed draws one line in the place's note slot naming
    >   the terminal and its setting, and the first real `alt+` chord retires it for the process.
    >   The first-run setup says the same remedy ahead of time, as a condition.
    >
    > `esc`-prefix behaviour is NOT described, and deliberately: `alt+1` arriving as escape-then-`1`
    > is what the terminal does when the setting is ON, and a person reads that as the chord simply
    > working. What "off" looks like is the character, which is what the note names.

## Deviations that remain, and why (each flagged to the owner)

- **"Hold alt" (3b)** — a terminal cannot see a held modifier; the map is `alt+.` (dismissed by the
  next key). The designer's own note offers `esc esc` as the fallback; not built unless asked.
- **"tenure" wording** — the mechanism of 2f is built exactly (three states, counted by
  `Item.CleanRuns`); the word is `trust`. The true reason (corrected 2026-08-25 — an earlier
  revision blamed `manual_test.go`, which in fact bans five other phrases): `tenure` is the
  RESIDENT'S own name for this exact mechanism (`config.KeyTenureAfter`,
  `internal/resident/tenure.go`), and CLAUDE.md forbids vocabulary travelling between the two
  products whether or not a test catches the word. Adjacent hazard for the owner: the resident's
  `TenureAfterAt` is a user-settable threshold for the same idea over charters, while
  `standing.TrustAfter = 5` is a v3 constant — two products now hold two thresholds for one idea,
  deliberately unlinked; do not "unify" them across the product wall.
- **Events with no mechanism** — "execution moved to sonnet when opus hit its rail" (no fall-through
  recorder) and "gmail moved itself to ask-first" (nothing self-demotes): the ledger lines exist
  only when the mechanism does; under the emptiness law they are absent, not faked.
- **`project:<dir>` memory shelves (2d)** — `store.Memory` has no workspace column; shelves are
  you / this project / this machine until the store learns one.
