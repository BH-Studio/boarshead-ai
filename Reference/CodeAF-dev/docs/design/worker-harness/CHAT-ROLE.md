# The role of the main chat once tasks are the main road

*2026-09-18, cell c244, design only. The owner's question: once `/task` runs on
the run engine, is the main chat a manager of the tasks, or a conversation the
management stays out of? Three candidates, one recommendation. Reads against
`docs/design/worker-harness/SURFACE.md` and `PR-BODY.md` ("Words on the
screen").*

## What the chat is now, mechanically

A `/task` typed in a conversation becomes the run's root; a second `/task`
while one runs is added as a **child of the live root**: no second store
(task_run_belt.go:160–200, `startTaskRun`). The run is driven beside the
conversation in a goroutine (`driveBeltRun`, task_run_belt.go:~288), and when
it lands the conversation is woken with one note, the outcome word, the root's
result, where the work went (`beltRunOutcomeNote`, :365;
`deliverBeltRunLanding`, :314). That note rides the machinery a landed task's
note rides (`postTaskMessage`, task_run.go:4054): priced as a wake, durable to
the person's record, and it starts a turn nobody typed (`startTurnLocked(userMessage{wake: true})`).

The cautionary number is pull request 1183's: before the present bound, one
landing woke a 28-minute turn of 49 tool-call rounds on the high tier over a
tree that was already clean. What bounds that turn today: run workers are
capped at `taskMaxSteps` = 200 (task_run.go:161, `RunSpec.StepsPerTask`), a
woken turn is metered by the loop's ceilings (`openCallWindow`,
callwindow.go:59), and wakecause.go's rule, a turn owes what arrived *in it*,
not the newest thing typed (wakecause.go:10–46). The wake is the one cost here
that compounds per landing; every candidate says what it does to it.

The store holds per task: status, parent, dependencies, `Waiting`, `Chat`,
`Project` (internal/plandb/model.go:122–148), notes, spend, a trajectory
(plandb_tasks.go:35, :84). It holds **no conversation node** the chat can
address and **no question row**. A question reaches a person today only
through the conversation's ask lanes (`asklane.go`), which a run worker has no
door into, it parks with `plandb wait` or the run ends `needed an answer`
(PR-BODY.md). The surface: a conversation is a **tab** on the strip (tui3
chattabs.go `tabBar`; app.go:1729), the **rail** holds the rows, and the
**landing card** is the transcript's object for work that landed.

## The three candidates

### A · The chat itself manages: prompt rules for routing

The conversation's prompt pages gain routing rules: on each message decide
*hand off* (a new `/task`), *add to the running task* (an `Amend` write), or
*keep in chat*. Splitting into children with depends-on is the chat's own
reading, expressed as `/task` briefs naming each other. While four tasks run
and one has just landed, the main tab holds a woken turn narrating the landing
beside the rail:

```
main tab
  rail · 4 tasks
   ◐ Widen the import…   step 3 · $ go test ./internal…
   ◐ Add the cache…      step 11 · $ git grep -n Cache
   ○ Fix the flake       waits: Widen the import
   ● Add rate limiter    done · 14 steps · $0.11

  the limiter task landed, merged · 14 steps · $0.11
  Ask me about it, or steer the rest here.
› you:
```

### B · A plan seat owns decomposition; the chat only converses

A second model, the plan seat, owns the plan: it decomposes, launches, and
reads landings in its own context, in a **second tab** holding that seat's
thread and the tree. The main chat only converses and receives one-line
outcomes:

```
main tab
  task landed: Add rate limiter · merged · $0.11
› you:
```

```
work tab · 4 tasks
   ◐ Widen the import…   step 3 · $ go test ./internal…
   ◐ Add the cache…      step 11 · $ git grep -n Cache
   ○ Fix the flake       waits: Widen the import
   ● Add rate limiter    done · 14 steps · $0.11
  note · you: keep the middleware order
  › a note for this task
```

### C · No second model: three verbs, and landings go to the work tab

The run engine and the store stay the scheduler; the chat's prompt pages gain
**three verbs**: *hand off*, *add to*, *ask about*. A landing does **not** wake
the chat, it goes to the work tab (the same tab shape as B, drawn by the
surface, not spoken by a model), and the chat gets a **one-line digest** with
no turn of its own, the same dim telemetry the rail already spends:

```
main tab
  task landed: Add rate limiter · merged · $0.11
› you:
```

```
work tab · 4 tasks
   ◐ Widen the import…   step 3 · $ go test ./internal…
   ◐ Add the cache…      step 11 · $ git grep -n Cache
   ○ Fix the flake       waits: Widen the import
   ● Add rate limiter    done · 14 steps · $0.11
  › a note for this task
```

## The six answers, per candidate

**What wakes the main conversation, and what one wake costs.** A: every
landing wakes a full turn (task_run_belt.go:303); four landings are four turns,
each a model pass over the whole conversation context, the exact shape of the
1183 turn, bounded only by the loop ceilings and wakecause.go's owed-ask rule;
at the high tier, dollars per landing, not cents. B: the wake lands on the
seat, not the chat, a shorter context, but a second standing model turn per
landing plus its decomposition turns. C: **no wake**: the landing is a surface
draw (the tab and rail already repaint on `Changed(since)`, store.go:864); the
digest line is written, not spoken. One landing costs a store read and a
repaint: zero model calls.

**Who answers a task's question.** A: nobody, structurally, a run worker has
no ask lane (asklane.go serves the conversation), so it parks with `plandb
wait` or ends `needed an answer`, discovered at the landing. B: the seat could
poll, but the store has no question row to poll; the seat would invent one.
C: the question becomes a store row the work tab draws (`your call` is already
the surface's word for a held task), answered by a note, the steering door
the task page already owns (`PlanNote`, plandb_steer.go:62).

**What the person sees while four tasks run.** A: the rail, and a chat that
narrates each landing in a full turn. B: a quiet main tab and a rich work tab,
at the cost of a second thread to read. C: the same rail and work tab as B,
and a main chat that stays a conversation.

**What breaks on resume.** A: nothing new, the wake is durable
(`durableDelivery`, task_run.go:4004–4014) and the store survives the closed
terminal. B: **the seat's context does not**: `codeaf resume` reopens the
store's tree, but the seat's reasoning about why it split the plan as it did is
gone unless re-derived from notes. C: nothing, tab, rail and store all
rehydrate from disk; the digest line is a journal line.

**What it needs from the store that is not there today.** A: nothing for routing. B: a conversation
node for the seat and a question row, neither exists (model.go:122). C: a
question row, drawn as `your call`; the digest is nearly `beltRunOutcomeNote`
already (task_run_belt.go:365).

**What it needs from the prompt pages that is not there today.** A: the whole
routing rule set, hand off / add to / keep, plus depends-on syntax in briefs;
the most prompt law of the three. B: a second persona's pages, plus steering
pages for the seat. C: three verbs stated once, the smallest addition, and
each names a thing the session already does.

## Recommendation

**C.** (1) It is the only candidate that answers the 1183 number with a shape,
not a bound: landings stop waking turns entirely, so four running tasks cannot
spend the conversation's money at all. (2) It keeps one brain, the run engine
and the store are already the scheduler (task_run_belt.go drives, `plandb`
enforces pause/cancel/dependencies), and B's seat re-solves decomposition the
store already holds, at model prices, with a resume story that does not
survive a closed terminal. (3) It keeps the main chat what the owner
half-wants, a conversation place: the digest is the rail's dim telemetry, one
line, and the three verbs live in the prompt pages where routing was always
going to live; B needs new persona pages, A needs the most prompt law of all.

**The one thing it gives up:** the chat is no longer the place a landing is
*understood*. A person who wants "what did the run conclude, in your words"
must open the work tab or ask; C's digest states the fact, not the reading. A
mitigates this by waking a turn, exactly the cost A pays.

**The smallest first cell that proves it**: one M cell, four items:

1. **Failing test first**: `internal/session`: `driveBeltRun` on a completed
   run starts no turn; `Wakes()` gets nothing, and the digest line is
   journal-authored (red against today's `deliverBeltRunLanding` wake,
   task_run_belt.go:303).
2. The digest line: `beltRunOutcomeNote` (task_run_belt.go:365) written to the
   conversation's journal as a dim line, no `wakeNote`, no
   `startTurnLocked(wake: true)`.
3. The work tab: the tab strip (chattabs.go) gains one tab of the run's rows , 
   the tasks place's own rows (taskplan.go `planItem`), the store's tree, and
   the note composer at the foot.
4. Manual: the landing's one line in the main chat, and the work tab, in
   `internal/manual/chat/tasks.md`, existing words only.

*Words on every mockup are the surface's own, task, step, note, steer,
rail, page, landing card, tab, plus the telemetry the rail already draws
(`waits:`, `done`, `N steps · $`). Design only; nothing under `internal/` or
`cmd/` changes in this cell.*

## A landing speaks only when an answer is owed (approved 2026-09-18)

The owner approved candidate C with one amendment of his own. A fully silent
landing is wrong in the commonest case: the chat launched the task in a turn
that was answering something the person asked, so the person is owed a reply.
The rule is one sentence: **a landing speaks only when an answer is owed.**

1. **At hand-off the debt is recorded.** When the chat launches a task in a
   turn that answers the person's ask, the task is marked *answer owed* and
   carries the person's question with it, in the store, on the task. A
   `/task` the person typed themselves is not marked: they asked for work,
   not for an answer.
2. **An owed landing wakes one short turn**, fed only the question and the
   task's result note. Its prompt says: answer from the result, never redo
   the work; if the result is thin, say so and offer a follow-up task.
3. **An unowed landing is the dim digest line**, zero model calls, exactly as
   candidate C draws it.
4. **A family replies once**, when the root lands, never per child. A
   check's landing wakes nobody (already the law in `internal/run`).
5. **The reply turn is bounded by shape, not by a ceiling**: the cheap tier,
   a few tool rounds at most, a context of two things. The 28-minute turn of
   pull request 1183 cannot recur because the turn has nothing to walk.

This extends wakecause.go's rule, "a turn owes what arrived in it", across a
hand-off: the ask arrived in the turn that launched the task, so the landing
that answers it is that turn's debt, paid once.

What it needs from the store: one field on the task, the owed question (empty
when nothing is owed), written at hand-off and read at the root's landing.
What it needs from the prompt pages: the reply turn's own short page, and the
three verbs. Words on the screen do not change: the digest line, the landing
card and the reply are the conversation's own sentences.

## The cells that build it

- **no wake, digest line**: `driveBeltRun` on a landed run starts no turn;
  the digest is a journal line (`beltRunOutcomeNote`). Failing test first.
- **work tab**: the tab strip gains the run's tab: the run's rows as the
  tasks place draws them, the live lines, the note composer at the foot.
- **three verbs**: hand off, add to, ask about, stated once in the chat's
  prompt pages and the manual.
- **answer owed** (after *no wake*): the store field, hand-off marks it, an
  owed root landing wakes the bounded reply turn, a family replies once.

## Where the hand-off enters

Under `CODEAF_TASK_BELT=bash` both doors take the run road. A typed `/task`
goes through `StartTask` to `startTaskRun`
(`internal/session/task_person.go`). The model's own `propose_task` is still
staged on the card and still waits for the person's yes; after approval
`stagedProposal.Commit` (`internal/session/task.go`) starts it through
`startKnownTaskRun` with the id the card showed, its acceptance composed into
the brief, its `depends_on` as the store's own dependencies, and the person's
ask when the turn owes one. A refusal from the run road falls through to the
session tree, exactly as a typed `/task` does. With the belt off nothing
changes.

Two facts the routing had to get right. A second task while a run is live
joins the live root as a child (`internal/session/task_run_belt.go`), so a
dependency may name a task that lives only in the store, and the spawn floor
asks the store before refusing it. The run is started under a context that
does not end with the turn: the turn cancels its own context on the way out,
and a run driven under it stopped the moment the model finished its sentence.

## One way to put work out (the owner, 2026-09-18)

Under the belt the conversation has one verb for work, `propose_task`, and
`quick_task` is absent from its belt and its page. The owner's words: one way,
a task; the model launches several when it needs to, and each is more of the
plan. A quick task ran on the session tree, outside the plan store, so the tree
could not show it and no check read it. The chat parallelizes by proposing
several tasks in one message: the first opens the run and each one after it
joins the live root, with `depends_on` for a part that must follow another.
`divide_work` was never on the conversation's belt and is never on a bash
belt worker, so nothing changed there. The predicate is the hand-off's own
guard (`Config.oneTaskRoad`): with the belt off, or with no run engine wired,
both verbs stay. The three rules c250 wrote are now one paragraph of the
hand-off fact (`handoffFacts`, `oneRoad`), so the page has no second copy.
The shipped engine's quick task and its pages are deleted with the rest of the
legacy engine when the default flips.
