"""Cut an asciinema recording where the application gives the screen back.

codeaf draws on the alternate screen. Everything after it switches back — a
shutdown log line, the shell prompt behind it — belongs to the terminal the
recording was started from and not to the journey being shown, and a GIF whose
last frame is somebody's shell is a GIF that ends on a mistake.

This trims the tail at that switch and does nothing else: no event is edited,
reordered, resampled or invented, and everything before the switch is the
recording exactly as it was captured.
