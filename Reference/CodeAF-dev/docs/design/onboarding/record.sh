#
# It is a recording of the real binary and nothing else: no mock, no
# reconstructed frames, no edited frames. The one thing it arranges is the WORLD
# the binary runs in — a throwaway home, a throwaway project, and a fixture
# credential of the right shape that no request is ever made with. The setup
# checks a pasted key for shape only and calls no model, so the whole recording
# costs nothing and reaches no network.

# Needs: tmux, asciinema, agg, ffmpeg (for the stills). Writes
# docs/design/onboarding/onboarding-wide.gif and leaves the cast under $OUT.
