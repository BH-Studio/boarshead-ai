# Standing goals — recognition, ratification, and ambient presence

*This is the v1-era design doc, and it is the ANCESTOR rather than the account:
what v3 built is docs/AMBIENT.md, and where the two disagree AMBIENT.md and the
code are right. Three decisions below have been overtaken by what shipped and
say so where they stand — the card's answers (Decision 2), the ambient rail
(Decision 3), and probation (Decision 5). Everything else here still holds,
which is why it is left as written.*

M3's mechanism is settled (ARCHITECTURE.md Decision 5: watches, sentinels,
rails). This document settles its *interface*, because the interface is the
feature: a standing responsibility you have to ceremonially declare is one
you will forget to declare. The governing critique (user's, of a `/goal`
command elsewhere): "anything I give, I expect to be a goal — I may not know
when to give goal and when not." Classification of one's own words is the
machine's job.

## Decision 1 — Recognition, never declaration

There is no `/goal` command. The compiler — which already reads scale from
structure — gains a temporal reading: does this ask *end*, or does it
*stand*? "Whenever a PR opens…", "remind me when…", "keep the suite green",
"every morning…", "watch this folder" — durable intent is recognized from
ordinary words, exactly as project-vs-task already is. An episodic ask
compiles to a job; a standing ask compiles to a **charter**.

**Rejected:** a mode, a command, a special syntax. The user speaks; the
system classifies; misreads are corrected in conversation like any other
compiler assumption.

## Decision 2 — The charter, and the one question that is always asked

A charter is the compiled form of standing intent:

- **invariant** — the user's verbatim words, permanent anchor
- **watch** — what wakes it: `cron:` schedule | `file:` glob | `graph:`
  predicate (node settled/failed, spend threshold) | `poll:` a checked
  condition (PRs, URLs) on a cadence
- **sentinel** — the cheap wake-time judgment: "is the invariant
  threatened / has the condition occurred?" — one small model call, so a
  watch can be broad and the action still precise
- **action** — what a firing splices (re-grounded at fire time; the world
  moves)
- **rails** — per-firing budget quote, firing-rate limit, expiry. Mandatory
  by construction; firings draw from the daily dollar rail like all work.

Everything else in codeaf assumes-and-declares. A charter is the one
exception: **standing = spending forever**, which crosses the consequence
gate, so ratification is explicit — the compiler plays back the charter as
a card and asks once. The ask is *selectable*, not an essay question:

    watch PRs on Agent-Field/codeaf — review each new one, post a summary
    fires: on new PR (polled ~2m)   costs: ~$0.15/firing, ≤10/day   expires: never
    ▸ 1 yes, stand this up      ▸ 2 change the cadence      ▸ 3 once, not standing

Options + free text; up/down + enter or a number key; the same interactive
option pattern becomes available to *every* compiler askback (the generic
"meta-prompting" surface — questions arrive with choices whenever choices
are enumerable, because picking beats composing).

**What shipped (v3):** the card is right, the words moved, and the third numbered
chip is not always there. The answers are `1 yes, set it up`,
`2 change when or where`, `3 just once` and `0 no` — the decline is a drawn chip
and never the row's own casualty, and esc says the same thing beside it — and
**a one-off reminder offers no `3`**, because doing "once, now" a thing that
already fires once and retires is a chip that does nothing.
`2 change when or where` is never one of the engine's answers: it opens the box
for the person's own correction, to the schedule or the reach alike, and the hint
under the card names exactly the keys the card drew
(`1 yes · 2 change when or where · 0 or esc, no`). Under the row is one dim line
saying what the picked answer will do, assembled from the proposal's own fields. The model is also told the clock — a `Now:`
line, refreshed inside a live session, plus `when.in` for a distance from right
now — and a moment already past is refused with the time it is, never moved on
to tomorrow.

## Decision 3 — Ambient presence: felt, not seen

Standing goals are furniture, not conversation. Apple's ambient rule:
visible exactly when relevant, otherwise one quiet line.

- The rail gains a **standing** section above tasks: one dim line per
  charter — `⏱ pr-watch · last fired 2h · 3 today`. Breathing only while a
  sentinel is evaluating or a firing is active.

  **What shipped (v3):** the place is HOME and not a rail — one row per item
  under its own project, `▲` needs you, `●` a pass has it in its hands right
  now, `◦` waiting for its time, `∙` paused or stopped — plus one status-line
  segment, `keeping an eye on N`, still while nothing runs and turning while
  something does. The breathing is real ACROSS PROCESSES rather than local to
  the window doing the work: a pass writes `standing/<id>/running` (its process
  id, when it started, and `checking` or `firing`) for as long as it holds an
  item, and any window reads it — `● checking now · since 4s`, `● firing now`.
  A marker whose process is gone, or older than the 120 s one pass may last, is
  a leftover and draws nothing.
- A **firing is an ordinary job**: it splices with `origin: trigger`
  pointing at its charter, gets a normal card in the thread (dock while
  running, settles in place) — but *charter-born cards land in the thread
  only when they carry a question, a delivery worth reading, or a failure*;
  routine "checked, nothing to do" firings stay in the rail and the
  journal. The interruption budget holds.
- Reminders are the degenerate charter (cron watch, expiry after one
  firing, action = say something): "remind me tomorrow at 9" just works,
  and the reminder arrives as an attention message.
- Management is conversational and clickable, never a config file: "stop
  watching PRs" retires it (the head recognizes charter references);
  clicking a standing line opens its charter card — history of firings,
  cost, pause / retire / edit-cadence as options. `/standing` lists; the
  card is the editor.

  **What shipped (v3):** all of it except the slash command, which is not
  needed — asking "what is standing?" in any chat lists them, and home's own
  rows take `p` to pause and `s` to stop. There is one more place a person can
  say it from: `ask here` on home opens a real exchange whose record is kept
  under the standing root, it OUTLIVES the screen it was asked on, several can
  be alive at once, and it is filed only once it has settled, been seen, and the
  cursor has left it (AMBIENT.md Part 5).

## Decision 4 — The system may propose, through the same door

The retrospective already detects recurring asks. A recurring pattern
(same-shaped job ≥3 times, or a recurring correction) may **propose** a
charter — rendered as the same ratification card, marked `proposed ·
noticed you ask this most mornings`, default-declined, never silently
armed. One proposal per reflection run; declining teaches (a declined
proposal is a notebook fact and is not re-proposed). This is 3.6's
"standing goals become learned" landing through the only legitimate gate:
the user's explicit yes.

## Decision 5 — Autonomy is earned after ratification (SUPERSEDED)

*Not built, and deliberately: v3's law is **rules are the tenure**. A firing runs
under the rules the person has already banked, with nobody to ask; anything that
would have asked stops the run as `needs your look` and the item says so. There
are no probation counters, no tenure threshold and no `CODEAF_TENURE_AFTER` —
counting three green firings would have been a second permission system beside
the one a person actually built by answering consent cards. The rest of this
section is kept as the v1 reasoning it was.*

Ratifying a charter authorizes the standing responsibility, not unattended
execution on day one. Every new charter begins on **probation**. When its
sentinel says yes, the thread shows what it would do and offers four durable
choices: approve this firing, not now, always allow, or never. Approval admits work
through the ordinary command queue and firing journal; the proposal itself
never compiles, plans, or splices work.

Three consecutive approved firings must independently finish green and within
the charter's per-firing rail before the charter becomes **tenured**. The
threshold is configurable with `CODEAF_TENURE_AFTER`. Always allow is an
explicit journaled override. A failed or cancelled subtree, a rejected output,
or a per-firing budget breach returns a tenured charter to probation; a second
failure demotion pauses it. “Back to asking” is the conversational, non-failure
reversion to probation.

## Decision 6 — Spend is visible and settable where you talk

`/budget` shows today: `spent $3.40 of $20 · resets midnight` and sets:
`/budget 50` (today's ceiling — a journaled raise), `/budget default 35`
(persisted config), `/budget unlimited today`. The same numbers live in
the charter cards (per-firing quotes) and the header's cost meter. Config
file and `CODEAF_DAILY_BUDGET` remain for headless; the slash command is
the conversational spelling of the same journaled events.

## Decision 7 — Presence when no terminal is open, asked exactly once

A standing goal that only fires while a window happens to be open is a
promise the system cannot keep. So the first ratified charter — and only
the first — earns one question in the resident's voice: "Should I keep
watching this when you're not here? `▸ 1 yes, always · ▸ 2 only while I'm
around`". Yes arranges a five-minute `codeaf wake` for this user account
and answers with a single line; no is remembered as a decline. Both
answers are journal events, so the never-ask-twice gate survives
restarts, rebuilds, and every later charter.

The mechanism is deliberately invisible: the user never reads the words
daemon, launchd, or systemd — only the consequence ("a quiet check every
few minutes, even with no terminal open"). Three properties make it
honest rather than decorative:

- **The choice is durable before the host is touched.** "Yes" is written
  first, then the timer is arranged. A crash or a host that refuses today
  becomes a repair on the next resident check, never a lost yes.
- **Status is derived, not asserted.** Installed means the definition file
  on disk still matches byte-for-byte what this build would write; last
  wake and next check come from journalled wake events plus the fixed
  cadence. Nothing shells out to ask.
- **Ratification never fails for the offer's sake.** The charter is
  already active when the offer is attempted; a failure to post it is
  logged, not surfaced as a rejected ratification.

`codeaf doctor` prints the same five rows this reasoning produces — brain,
resident, standing watch, spend, standing work — and those rows are the
grounding the head answers "who's keeping watch?" from.

## What this is not

- Not a scheduler UI. No cron-syntax dialogs; cadence is stated in words
  and echoed back in words ("every weekday at 9" → `cron` internally).
- Not a rules engine. The sentinel is judgment, not pattern-matching — a
  broad watch with a smart sentinel beats a precise trigger with none.
- Not push-notification spam. Firings obey the same interruption budget
  as everything else; the daily rail bounds the worst day by construction.
