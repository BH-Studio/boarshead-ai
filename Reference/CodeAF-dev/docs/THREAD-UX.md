# The thread and the cards — one conversation, many living jobs

The observed failure: with several jobs in flight, the thread interleaves
their updates as anonymous bubbles — "finished the comparison, writing it
up" lands between two unrelated messages and the reader cannot tell which
job spoke. The store already knows (every message carries an optional
`NodeID` anchor, `store/thread.go:63-65`; the narrator already debounces
per-job progress, `resident/narrator.go`); only the *presentation* flattens
it. This document settles the fix. The design vocabulary is Apple's — Live
Activities, progressive disclosure, one attention stream — applied to a
terminal-first agent.

## The one-sentence design

The thread is a conversation between two parties — the user and the agent —
and every piece of *work* renders not as stream bubbles but as a **living
card**: one card per job, updating in place, docked while active, settling
into the thread where it was born when it completes.

## The v3 stream law — answers flush, work indented and folded

In the live v3 chat, flush-left is said to the person and a two-column gutter
means work done on their behalf. The current trailing assistant block is the
answer and remains flush; if a later tool call arrives, that block is
reclassified as intermediate work on the next render. Thinking, calls, results,
expanded details, tool-window fold lines, and intermediate assistant text all
share the gutter. Under the existing 60-column phone floor the gutter is zero.

Thinking still collapses on the first non-reasoning event. When a successful
turn settles with both work and a trailing answer, the entire work section then
collapses one level further into a single `▸ worked … · ctrl+e` chip. Opening the
turn restores the thinking chip and three-call window exactly as they were; it
does not flatten their bounded disclosure. Questions, failures, and work with no
answer remain visible. The fold is derived from the entries, not journaled, so
replayed conversations and task rooms obey the same rule.

## Decision 1 — The stream is attention; the card is state

Two kinds of content, two behaviors:

- **Conversation** (user words, head replies, askbacks, receipts of intent)
  is the stream — append-only bubbles, exactly today.
- **Work** (narration, progress, landed parts, cost ticks) is card state —
  it *mutates* its job's card and never appends to the stream.

The stream's interruption budget is three things, the three a person would
speak up for: a **question** the work cannot proceed without, a
**delivery**, and a **failure**. Everything else is ambient — visible on
the card, never breaking the conversation's flow. (The narrator's existing
doctrine — milestone-driven, debounced, failures interrupt — is exactly
this; the card is where its lines now land.)

Questions the agent can save do not spend that interruption budget. They are
journaled with their origin and urgency, and pending non-blocking questions
sit in a slim `?` dock row. A blocking question still speaks immediately;
one `next-natural-moment` question may follow a session attach or settled
delivery; a `whenever` question speaks only when the user selects it. Opening
the dock is inline disclosure, never a modal, and never steals the active
input. Answers reference and resolve the journaled question so later memory
and distillation can consume the exchange.

**Rejected:** per-message job tags in the stream (colored glyph prefixes).
Attribution by decoration still leaves N interleaved monologues; the reader
does the grouping in their head. Cards do the grouping in the interface.

## Decision 2 — One card per job, four states

A card is the job's public face, derived entirely from the store (anchored
messages + node status + usage — no new tables):

| state | rendering |
|---|---|
| **compiling** | title forming: the verbatim ask + "reading this as…" receipt |
| **working** | breathing: latest narrator line, parts done/total, elapsed, cost so far |
| **question** | raised hand: the question inline, answer box focused — the card *is* the prompt |
| **settled** | receipt: ✓/✗, one-line outcome, cost; the deliverable unrolls beneath it |

The card carries its whole history: expanding it shows the rolled-up
running summary (every narrator line spoken so far, assumptions declared,
parts landed with one-line results) — "a summary of all previous, per
task," kept current by the machinery that already produces each line.

## Decision 3 — Docked while active, settled in place when done

Where a card lives answers "what is it doing *now*" and "what did it do
*then*" differently:

- **Active cards dock** in a compact strip above the input line — the
  Dynamic Island move. One line each: `◐ pricing survey · 3/7 · 2m · 12¢`.
  However far the user scrolls into history, running work stays one glance
  away. Three or fewer active jobs: one line each; more: the dock
  summarizes ("5 running · 1 question ⚑") and expands on focus.
- **When a job settles, its card leaves the dock** and its full form lives
  permanently at its birth position in the thread — where the user asked.
  The thread reads as a true history: ask, card, ask, card. The
  deliverable's landed answer (markdown, reveal, clickable paths — all
  kept) unrolls inside the settled card, not as a disconnected bubble.

## Decision 4 — Disclosure is a ladder, and every rung is a click

card line → expanded card → job graph → node flight recorder

- **Click a docked or settled card**: expands in place — running summary,
  assumptions, parts with one-line results, cost meter.
- **Click deeper** (or `enter`): the job view — the existing graph rail
  scoped to this job's subtree.
- **Click a part**: the existing node flight recorder.
- `esc` / ‹ back climbs down; the ladder never dead-ends.

Nothing new is invented here — the graph rail and node view exist; the
ladder gives them an entry point that starts at the conversation instead of
beside it. The rail stops being a second place to watch everything and
becomes where you go when a card invites you deeper.

## Decision 5 — The store already speaks this shape

- Narrator lines: `PostMessage` with `NodeID` = the job's root (anchored
  today or a one-line change). A card is `Messages` filtered by subtree —
  a view, not a table.
- Card status/parts/cost: `ActiveNodes()` + `Usage()` scoped to the
  subtree, both existing queries.
- The head's snapshot doctrine is unchanged — cards are the *user's* read
  of the workforce; the head keeps its own.
- Attach/replay: because cards are derived, `codeaf attach` and any future
  web lens render the same thread-with-cards from the same journal. The
  TUI is one renderer of a store-shaped truth, which is what keeps this
  Apple-like instead of Apple-themed: the polish is in the model, so every
  surface inherits it.

## Decision 6 — Interaction polish: reachable, streaming, alive

Settled after first use of the cards build:

- **Keybinding**: the graph rail toggles on `alt+g` (option-G), not `ctrl+g`
  — ctrl chords collide with terminal conventions (^G is BEL) and macOS
  muscle memory. Every toggle also has a slash command and a click target.
- **Slash commands**: the input line accepts `/graph` (toggle rail),
  `/tasks` (dock focus), `/node <id|click>`, `/notebook`, `/help` — same
  actions as the keys, discoverable by typing `/`. A slash line is consumed
  by the TUI, never sent to the head.
- **Mouse everywhere the eye goes**: the rail's edge/header is a click
  toggle; dock cards click to expand; the split is already draggable; every
  affordance that opens has a visible ⟨×⟩ or esc path back.
- **Streaming, not appearing**: head replies and landed answers stream
  token-wise into the thread (the provider already streams; the TUI buffers
  — stop buffering, render deltas with the existing unroll pacing as the
  floor). Nothing in the conversation should materialize fully formed.
- **The rail closed is not blindness**: with the rail hidden, running work
  speaks through an inline **shimmer line** under the last message — the
  narrator's current line per active job, animated subtly (a slow gradient
  sweep, matte not flashy), updating in place, collapsing into the settled
  card when the job lands. The dock shows state; the shimmer shows *now*.
- **Typographic hierarchy, audited**: one scale, four levels — conversation
  body (primary ink), card titles (semibold), meta/receipts/cost (dim),
  code/paths (mono, linked). Violet reserved exclusively for the question
  state (the one thing that wants attention). No bold walls; emphasis is
  spent like budget.

## What this costs and when

Pure presentation layer over existing events: no schema change beyond
anchoring narrator messages to job roots, no new LLM calls (the rolling
summary is the narrator's own accumulated lines). Lands after the current
TUI work-in-progress merges — it touches `internal/tui` rendering and the
thread pane only.
