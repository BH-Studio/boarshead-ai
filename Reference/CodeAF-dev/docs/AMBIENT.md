# The ambient side — what codeaf does when you are not asking

*Design doc, 2026-08-20; brought level with the code 2026-08-21. Status: BUILT —
`internal/standing` (the files, the pass, the OS timer), `internal/session`
(the card, the sentinel, the runner) and `internal/tui3` (home's band, the
`ask here` exchange). Where this document and the code disagree, the code is
right and this document is the bug. Companion to CHAT-V3.md (the session) and
HOME-BRIDGE.md (the place a window opens onto). STANDING.md and
ARCHITECTURE.md Decision 5 are the v1 ancestors; this document says what v3
takes from them and what it leaves.*

## The one-sentence design

A conversation can leave something behind that keeps working after the window is
closed — a reminder, a watch, a rule, an overnight job — and the machine keeps those
things honest, cheap, and quiet with no server, no daemon, and no new place to look.

## Part 1 — What a person gets

These are written as things you say. Every one of them is recognised from ordinary
words; none of them is a command. Every one of them shows you a card with what it will
do, when, and what it costs, and does nothing until you say yes.

### Reminders and routines

- "Remind me at 6 to leave."
- "Remind me every Sunday to water the plants."
- "Every Monday at 9, draft the weekly update from the git log and my calendar."
- "Every weekday at 8, read my inbox and list what needs a reply today."
- "At the end of each day, write two lines on what I committed, for my standup."
- "On the first of the month, pull the Hetzner and OpenRouter invoices into finance/."

A reminder is the smallest of these: it fires once, it says one line, it retires.

### Watches on the world

- "Tell me when CI on main goes red."
- "Tell me when a PR opens on this repo." / "…when someone reviews mine."
- "Watch this log for `OOM`." / "Tell me when port 5173 comes up."
- "Tell me when the Dyson drops under 500." / "…when the docs site returns anything but 200."
- "Tell me when a new release of `charm.land/bubbletea` ships."
- "Tell me when disk on this box goes under 10 GB."
- "Tell me when the TLS cert on api.example.com has under 14 days."
- "When an invoice from Hetzner lands in mail, file it under finance/."
- "When Priya replies on that thread, draft an answer for me."
- "Fifteen minutes before a meeting with the design team, brief me from our last thread."
- "When a Linear issue is labelled `bug`, try to reproduce it and tell me what you found."

A watch can look with a shell command, a URL, a file glob, or a tool on a connected
account (mail, calendar, Linear, Notion, Slack, anything a signed-in service brings).
v1 built its watches before codeaf had accounts; v3 has them, and that is what makes
half of this list possible.

### Rules you stop thinking about

- "Keep main green." — on red, a task investigates in its own worktree and either lands
  the fix under the rules you have already banked, or stops as `needs your look`.
- "Whenever a PR opens, review it and leave a summary."
- "Whenever I push a branch, run the tests and tell me before I open the PR."
- "Keep the benchmark number from regressing more than 5%."
- "Keep the README's install command working — try it on a fresh container every week."
- "Keep the manual in step: whenever a slash command or tool is added, check the pages."
- "Keep dependencies current — open one PR a week with what moved and whether tests pass."
- "Track the flaky tests — tell me on Friday which ones failed more than twice."

A rule's firing is an ordinary v3 task: a brief, a worktree, a landing, a cost row, a
room you can walk into. Nothing new to learn.

### Overnight and long-horizon work

- "Tonight, run the full suite and the benchmark and have a report for me in the morning."
- "Try the migration overnight. Stop if tests fail. Spend at most $5."
- "Keep trying to get the port build green — up to four attempts, then tell me where it stands."
- "Every night, one line on what changed in this repo since yesterday."
- "Every Friday, a changelog draft from the week's merges."

Close the laptop lid. A one-shot with an expiry, or a rhythm. The result is waiting in
the conversation that asked for it.

### Follow-ups the work proposes by itself

A task finishing can offer, on a card, default declined:

- "re-run the suite when `schema.sql` changes?"
- "check the deploy in 20 minutes?"
- "wait for this PR to be reviewed, then address the comments?"
- "you have asked for this most mornings — make it a routine?"

Never armed by itself. Declining is remembered and not re-proposed.

### A watch that survives the window

Today's `watch` tool — a command on a timer that speaks only the delta — dies with the
terminal. With this, closing a window that still has one asks once: keep watching? Yes,
and tomorrow the same conversation hears the news when you resume it.

### Home becomes the inbox

One screen, every project: `▲` needs you, `◆` news since you left, a dim count of what is
being kept an eye on. Open a conversation that was busy while you were away and it opens
on one fold — `while you were away` — what fired, what it found, what needs you, what it
cost. Twenty minutes away: nothing, because you missed nothing.

### Nothing to run, nothing to expose

No server, no port, no account, no config file. An OS user timer you said yes to once;
a status you can read in `/status` that is derived from files, not asserted; a daily
rail that stops spending and asks. Over `--host` the watches live on the devbox, where
the work is — not on your laptop.

### What it will not do, said plainly

- It will not fire while the machine sleeps. launchd and systemd (`Persistent=true`)
  catch up when the machine wakes, and the brief says a check was late.
- It will not reach your phone. There is no outward lane (OPEN — see Part 5).
- It will not spend past the daily rail, or past a firing's own cap, without asking.
- It will not do anything unattended that you have not already allowed in a window.
  Nobody present means the consent gate denies, and the work stops as `needs your look`.
- It will not pretend a check happened. A watch that ran for thirty mornings and found
  nothing reads differently from one that never ran.

## Part 2 — What v3 takes from v1, and what it leaves

v1's mechanism is right and small; what it is wrapped in is not needed.

| Keep (≈2.7k LOC in v1) | Leave (≈40k LOC in v1) |
|---|---|
| OS user timer → `codeaf wake` → bounded pass (120 s, 32 ticks, early stop). `internal/watchdog` reused nearly verbatim. | The SQLite event graph and the head/resident split. v3 is folders + JSONL. |
| A live window holds a lock; the timer's wake refuses if held. `internal/lease` shape. | Practice loop, belief aging, retrospectives, self-audit dials, competence map, surprise ledger, crafts, skills. v3 has routed memory and the fix store; none of this is the ambient side's job. |
| Charter = the person's verbatim words + watch (cron / file / poll) + sentinel + action + rails. Rails mandatory by construction. | `graph:` watches. There is no graph. |
| One cheap yes/no sentinel call carrying its own previous judgments, so a declined firing is not re-proposed forever. | The 1.7k LOC regex cadence recogniser. In v3 the model is the compiler. |
| Ratify once on a card; offer the timer once, ever; "yes" journaled before the host is touched; installed status derived from file bytes. | Probation → tenure counters. See "rules are tenure". |
| Ambient law: routine "checked, nothing" never enters the conversation. Arrival brief only after ≥4 h and only if something happened. | Services with health probes and restart policy. A background job with a keep flag covers it later if wanted. |

## Part 3 — The mechanism in v3 terms

1. **Recognition, not declaration.** The model reads standing words and calls one belt
   tool, `stand`, with the person's words, a watch spec, an action, and rails. The
   surface draws the card. Nothing stands until yes.

   **The card's answers are the kind's answers.** A one-off reminder offers two numbered
   chips — `1 yes, set it up` and `2 change when or where` — because "just once" said of
   a thing that already fires once and retires is a chip that does nothing. Everything
   else keeps the third: `3 just once` runs the action now and arms nothing.
   `2 change when or where` is never in the engine's list of answers; it opens the box
   for the person's own correction, to the schedule or the reach alike. **And every card
   draws `0 no`**, which is the way out and the one chip a narrow row never drops; esc
   says the same thing in the conversation.

   **And the model knows the clock.** The system prompt carries a `Now:` line with the
   date, the minute and the zone, refreshed inside a live session so a conversation
   opened at breakfast does not do arithmetic from breakfast's minute at lunch; a
   relative moment goes to `stand`'s own `when.in` ("2m", "1h30m") and is resolved
   against the real clock at the instant of the call. A moment that has already passed
   is REFUSED with the time it is now — never quietly moved to tomorrow.
2. **Storage is files.** `~/.codeaf/v3/standing/<id>.json` — one document per charter,
   written temp + rename, flocked on mutate. `standing/ledger-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` —
   append-only, for the daily rail and max-per-day. `standing/<id>/runs/<n>/` — each
   firing is an ordinary session folder, so `/cost`, `/export`, the task index and the
   room all work unchanged. Runs live **outside** `projects/` so home never scans them,
   and "no news" runs are reaped after 7 days by the existing sweep law.

   **A run says what it came to, in its own folder.** Each firing writes one word into
   `runs/<n>/came-to`, and exactly one of them — `nothing` — is the sweep's licence over
   the folder. A task firing comes to nothing when its headless child saved no file, left
   nothing waiting for a person and had nothing to say when it finished; a run like that
   delivers no line and draws no row, because the whole of the news would be that there
   was no news. Everything else — a line said, work landed, a needs-your-look, a failure,
   and any run whose folder never said what it came to — is kept like any session.
   Reaping removes the FOLDER and nothing else: the day's ledger row is money and is
   never swept, and the item goes on remembering that it ran and what came of it.
3. **Who ticks.** Any open window takes `v3/locks/standing.lock` and runs the pass every
   5 minutes. The OS timer is the backup for "no terminal open". Same binary, same pass,
   same lock.
4. **A firing is a session.** Sentinel says yes → a child session runs in the charter's
   project under the person's banked rules. Anything that would ask stops the run as
   `needs your look`; its presence file says so; home sorts it to the top.
   **Rules are tenure:** no counters. What you banked is what runs unattended.
5. **Where news lands: four roads, first one that ends at a person.** (a) The origin
   conversation if it is open in this process — the row is DRAWN AT ONCE beside the
   steering note, so a person sitting in the room hears it in the room. (b) Any other
   open conversation of the same project, most recently touched first, because the window
   somebody is actually sitting in is a better address than a file. (c) The origin's own
   inbox, folded under one `while you were away` the next time it opens. (d) The
   PROJECT's inbox for an item born in an `ask here` errand — an exchange is not a row
   anywhere, so its own folder is a dead letter office. A firing is never steered into an
   errand's pane. A "no" leaves one line in the item's own log and nothing anywhere else.
6. **Presence, felt not seen.** One dim status-line segment only when items exist,
   breathing only while a firing runs. The card is the editor: pause, retire, change the
   cadence in words, in the conversation or by clicking.

   **`●` crosses processes, because a marker does.** A pass runs in whichever of a live
   window or `codeaf tick` took the lock, so "firing now" is knowledge one process has
   and every other one needs. While a pass holds an item it writes
   `standing/<id>/running` — the process id, the moment it started, and `checking` or
   `firing` — and removes it when that item's pass ends. Any window reads it: the row
   wears `●`, the card says `● checking now · since 4s` or `● firing now`, and the status
   segment turns. It is DERIVED AND ALWAYS DOUBTED: a marker whose process is gone, or
   which is older than the 120 s one pass may last, is a leftover and draws nothing — so
   a machine that lost power mid-firing never shows a watch that has been checking since
   Tuesday. An item a rail skipped is never marked at all; it was in nobody's hands.
7. **Money.** Per-firing cap + daily rail, both quoted on the card, both read from the
   spend journal that already exists. The sentinel call is billed as an auxiliary line.
8. **Honesty.** `/status` prints keeping watch: installed / window-only / off, last
   wake, next check — all derived.

## Part 4 — Storage: the numbers, and the trajectory

Measured 2026-08-20 on the author's machine: 48 sessions, 39 projects, 21 MB, largest
transcript 1.4 MB, a full home read of every session in 50 ms.

Assume a heavy user — 30 charters, one poll every 2 minutes, 50 firings a day, a year:

| Load | Files + JSONL | Breaks at |
|---|---|---|
| Tick: read 30 docs of ~1 KB | <1 ms | never |
| "Checked, nothing" | rewrite `lastChecked` in the doc; never a line per tick (that would be 365 MB/yr) | — |
| Daily rail across firings | append-only daily ledger; `O_APPEND` lines <4 KB are atomic on a local fs; sum ≤ hundreds of lines | never |
| 18k runs a year | session folders outside `projects/`, TTL-reaped | only if put under `projects/` (home's refresh would reach ~1 s cold) |
| "Every firing of the PR watch in May, with cost" | scan an 18k-line JSONL ≈ 10 ms | ~1M rows, or several hosts on one store |

Writers to one charter doc: the elected ticker, the person's window, a finishing firing.
Three, rarely at once, one document each — temp + rename and a per-doc flock, the
pattern `presence.json` and `meta.json` already use. The one cross-document invariant
(the rail) rides the append-only ledger; the worst race is two firings passing the cap
in the same second, an overspend bounded by one firing's cap, which v1 accepted too.

Where files and SQLite fail alike: NFS and synced home directories. flock is unreliable
there and SQLite says the same of itself. `CODEAF_HOME` is the answer, and the page says
so.

**Decision: files.** The dependency cost of SQLite is zero (v1 links it in the same
binary), but it would be a second truth beside the folders that home, world, presence,
the sweep and `cat` already read. v1's 26k LOC of store was the event-sourced graph, not
SQLite — and that is the part v3 is not bringing.

**Trajectory.** One package, `internal/standing`, owns every path and every read. If a
real query need or a multi-host need appears, a SQLite **index derived from the files**
is added behind that package — rebuildable from the folders at any time, never the
truth, and no caller changes. That is the whole plan, and it is deliberately not built
now.

## Part 5 — Where you say it: home, errands, and the record

The problem in the person's words: "remind me at 6" or "tell me when CI goes red" is
something you say from anywhere, most naturally from home. It is not a project
conversation, and it is not a single question either — getting to the card can take a
tool call or two and a sentence back and forth. But every such exchange today becomes a
session row, and home's list would fill with one-off errands that are done.

The tempting answer — a chat that is not stored — is wrong twice: the name is scary, and
the record is the value. "Why did I get this reminder?" must open the conversation that
made it. Nothing that fires may lack provenance.

**What was built instead of "home lists a conversation by what it came to": an item is
its own row.** That earlier rule filed the conversation under the thing it made, and a
person's own reading of the screen is what killed it — a conversation and the thing it
left behind are two objects with two lives. The chat goes quiet and folds away; the item
goes on firing for a year. Filing one under the other either hides a live item behind a
fold about a dead chat, or keeps a dead chat on the list because something it made is
still running. So an item is a row of its own, under its own project, in one band of
three with a door for the rest — and opening it opens the conversation that asked for
it, which is the half of the old rule that was right: **"why did I get this?" always has
an answer, and the answer is always a door.** An item made at home that never became a
conversation says so rather than offering a door onto nothing.

**Answering in place was built, and it is a row.** `ask here` — one ↑ above
`start a new conversation`, or ctrl+enter — opens a real session against the standing
root rather than under `v3/projects/`, so home never lists it and the record still
exists. Four rules, and the first three exist because the first cut had the exchange
living on the home view, where opening another conversation to check something killed
the errand mid-question and the engine answered the card nobody could see any more with
`the card was left unanswered — nothing was set up`:

- **it outlives home.** The list of exchanges is on the app; home merely draws it.
  Closing home, walking away, opening another conversation — none of them touch the
  agent.
- **several at once.** A second `ask here` ADDS one; nothing is replaced.
- **the pane is the row's.** The exchange is drawn in the right pane only while the
  cursor is on its row; every other row keeps its ordinary card.
- **it is filed when it is over, seen, and left** — once its pane has been drawn after
  it settled and the cursor has moved off it. One folder, which only ever MOVES: made
  under `standing/exchanges/<id>/`, moved to `standing/<item id>/exchange/` when
  something stands, moved to a project bucket if it is continued as a conversation, and
  left where it was made — for the sweep to reap after seven days — if it came to
  nothing.

**Which project owns an errand typed at home** is the project under the cursor, and the
person's home directory (`~`) when on none; a machine-wide reminder's workspace is `~`,
which is why home draws a `~` heading for a workspace that has items and no
conversations at all.

**The word** is *keeping an eye on* — the band's fold says `…3 more keeping an eye`, the
status segment says `keeping an eye on 2`, and the manual page is `keeping-an-eye.md`.
"standing watch" stays resident vocabulary and stays out of the chat corpus.

Still open:

1. **Outward lane.** Desktop notification for `needs your look` and reminders, off by
   default. v1 had none, and neither does this.
2. **Unattended scope beyond one project.** A firing runs a full task under banked
   profile rules; home's `elsewhere` limit still means a window can only open a
   conversation in its own project.

## What this is not

- Not a server, a daemon, a port, or an account. The timer is the whole host footprint.
- Not a scheduler UI. Cadence is said in words and echoed in words.
- Not a rules engine. The sentinel is judgment: a broad watch with a smart sentinel beats
  a precise trigger with none.
- Not notification spam. Routine silence is the design; the rail bounds the worst day.
- Not a second memory system, a learning loop, or a self-improvement programme.
