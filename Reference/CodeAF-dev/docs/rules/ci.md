# The checks

## Two gates, and the heavy one is not on your pull request

| Where | Workflow | What runs | Roughly |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| pull request into `dev`, and every push to `dev` | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | `light gate`: build, gofmt, vet, the packed corpora, the change entry, the manual law, the laws. `touched packages`: the full selected suites in concurrent legs with bounded failure attribution. `check`: green only when both are | `light gate` a few minutes; `touched packages` as long as the slowest touched package; `check` when both are in |
| pull request into `staging` or `main`, every push to either, and nightly at 09:00 UTC | `.github/workflows/ci-full.yml` | the whole suite, six-platform cross build, the two-machine remote test | tens of minutes |
| Friday after the 17:00 Toronto cutoff, or a manual dispatch | `.github/workflows/promote-staging.yml` | plan the cutoff commit, call Full check on that commit, fast-forward staging if it passes, and report the release and production signal | Full check plus the release build |
| every push to `dev`, `staging` or `main`; a manual stable or channel dispatch | `.github/workflows/release.yml` | resolve and guard the tag, test the release surface except on dev, build six binaries with furrow, publish | — |

**The light gate is deliberately light.** Work reaches `dev` many times a day,
much of it written by agents, and a gate that takes fifteen minutes is a gate
people learn to route around. So the pull-request gate asks only the questions
whose answer is the same on every machine and whose failure always means
somebody broke something.

**The price of that trade is that `dev` is not trustworthy on its own.** That is
not a flaw in the arrangement, it is the arrangement: `dev` is where things are
allowed to be briefly wrong, `staging` is where they are not. The full suite is
paid for once, on the way into `staging`, instead of on every pull request.
`Full check` is also called by the weekly promotion with the chosen commit as
its `ref`; that run is the check the promotion uses before moving staging.

**But "light" never meant "runs a filter nobody remembers".** Until 2026-09-02
the gate's one test step over the engine was `go test -run 'Manual'`, and the
endings ratchet in `internal/session` went red on `dev` through two merged pull
requests with every check green (#372). A structural test — one that reads the
tree and refuses a shape — decides in under a second and the same on every
machine, which is the light gate's own definition of what belongs on it. So the
gate now runs every one of them, found by what they do rather than by a list,
and runs the packages a change touched in full beside them — on the pull
request, where a red can still be read before it is on the trunk. `check`, the
one required name, is green only when both halves are.

## What the light gate actually checks

Seven things in `ci.yml`, job name `light gate`, then the touched packages, then `check`:

- **`go build ./...`** — several sessions work this tree at once and a
  half-finished file breaks the build for everybody. Cheapest possible answer to
  the most blocking possible failure.
- **`make fmt-check`** — a file gofmt would rewrite is a file the next editor's
  save rewrites, and that diff lands in somebody else's pull request.
- **`go vet ./...`** — the class of bug agents produce most: a `printf` verb that
  does not match, a cancel that is never called, a result that is thrown away.
- **The packed corpora build from their folders.** `go generate` on the packed
  package (`internal/manual`), then compile and test the manual's packed release path. Its
  archives are ignored build products, avoiding one binary merge hotspot; the
  other packed corpora remain tracked, so the tree must still come back clean.
- **The change is written down.** A new file in `docs/changes/unreleased/`,
  well formed. Two seconds. It carries the one thing a diff cannot — which of
  the things somebody believes about this repository stopped being true — and it
  is asked for here because it is worth nothing written later. A one-line
  `kind: internal` entry is a legitimate answer and the `no-changelog` label is
  the way out; [changelog.md](changelog.md) is the rule.
- **The manual law.** `internal/manual`, plus the `Manual` tests in
  `internal/tui3` and `internal/session` — every slash command and alias, every
  tool on the belt, and every probe question still reaching the page that answers
  it. Six seconds, and it is the law that gets broken most.
- **The laws hold.** `make test-laws`: every test in the tree that opens the
  repository's own source with `go/ast` or `go/parser` — the endings ratchet,
  the guard, the taxonomy, the words the e2e suite waits
  for. `scripts/laws.sh` finds them by that import, so a new law is on the gate
  the day it is written and there is no list to forget. About twenty seconds
  after the link. Every test in a file that carries the marker runs, so a file
  whose behavioural half is slow should move its laws out rather than argue with
  the script.

**`touched packages`** is the aggregate job: the full suite of every package
this change touched runs with `-count=1` in concurrent tui3, session, codeaf and
rest legs on separate runners, beside the light gate. `scripts/touched-packages.sh`
is the ONE selector shared with `make test-touched`; it compares `BASE..HEAD`,
maps changed `.go` files to surviving root-module packages, excludes nested
modules and emptied directories, and expands root `go.mod` or `go.sum` changes
to the whole tree. No Go or module change means no test leg. **It blocks.** It
was neutral for a day, then off pull requests for a day (#499), and in that day
#523 merged red on `cmd/codeaf` with `check` green, as #437, #439 and #483 had
before the job existed. The owner's ruling is that it runs on the pull request
and `check` needs it.

The public standard Ubuntu runner has 4 vCPU and 16 GB; each leg prints `nproc`
and `free -g` so a run records its actual capacity. `-p 2` allows concurrent
compilation/testing in rest while leaving linker headroom. `make test` compiles
`internal/tui3` and `internal/session` once each, then runs sorted top-level
tests as round-robin concurrent shards: four in CI, locally at most eight by
default, or `SHARDS=1` for the serial outcome. Their complete runs still hold
the one-suite-per-box lock. Sharding `cmd/codeaf` was tried and its sharded runs
failed, so it is not sharded. Its codeaf leg still runs beside tui3 and session
on a separate runner. Each suite/shard and focused probe gets 15 minutes; a
leg's 60-minute ceiling leaves room for bounded diagnosis.

`scripts/touched-verdict.sh` reads the plain output of the same `make test` run
everyone else gets, including package lines and the shard runner's summaries.
The initial run, head retry and base probe all avoid `-json`: Go 1.26 replaces
`os.Stderr` under that flag, and helpers re-executing the test binary inherit
`-test.v=test2json` and print framing that changes their output. Those changes
can manufacture failures at both head and base and hide a real regression.
Focused probes use ordinary `-v` to distinguish a pass from an absent or skipped
test. The job log is the original text. Every test runs in the initial selected
suites: the classifier disables the shared Makefile's ledger skip flags.
Each named failing test gets ONE focused retry on
head, then, if it fails again, ONE focused probe at the exact base (PR base SHA,
previous push tip, or `HEAD~1` for a first push or dispatch). Subtests use their
full names so passing siblings are not retried; a temporary detached base
worktree is created only when needed and removed afterward.

- A passing head retry is **flaky**; another failure at base is **already failing
  on the base**. Both warn with package/test names, appear in the step summary,
  and stay green. The first failure remains in the log.
- A base pass or a test/package absent at base makes the failure this change's
  own and stays red. A skipped test or unbuildable base is inconclusive and red.
- Build/setup failures, timeout panics, panics outside a test, killed processes,
  shard errors and other unnamed failures stay red without retries, even beside
  named failures. Plain text cannot prove a panic's test ownership, so all
  panics stay red; missing package lines or shard summaries also stay red.
  **More than five failed tests per leg** fail with their list
  and no probes; ten focused runs is the maximum diagnostic budget.

A flaky test is still a bug with an owner; it just is not evidence that this PR
introduced it. The aggregate appends ONE comment per same-repository run with
warnings (run link, SHA, package, test, classification) to the lowest-numbered
open issue with the exact title **touched packages: flaky or already-failing
tests**, creating it if absent. A rare find-or-create race may create duplicates;
later runs converge on the lowest number. The issue is never closed automatically.
Forks make no issue call; API/artifact-reporting errors do not change the result.

**`check`** remains the only required name: it needs the light gate and the
`touched packages` aggregate and is green only when both are. The aggregate
requires a successful selector and every needed leg; an empty selection is
green, while failed selection or failed/cancelled needed legs stay red. Matrix
fail-fast is disabled so one leg cannot cancel another's evidence.

Run the same thing before you push:

```sh
make pr-ready
```

`make pr-ready` runs the light-gate pieces above, tooling acceptance only when
scripts/, the Makefile or the covered benchmark paths changed, then
`make test-touched`. The touched target uses the same selector, partitions and
classifier as CI with `-count=1 -p 2`; local legs run sequentially on one box,
preserving the per-leg failure cap. It refuses staged, unstaged or untracked Go
or module files: commit the candidate so the proof sees exactly what CI sees,
without absorbing another session's work. Pass `BASE=<commit>` for the exact
PR base; locally it defaults to `origin/dev`. A docs-only change still runs the
light half. Local classification makes no issue API call. `test-quick` keeps
its existing prerequisites; tooling is not an unconditional light-gate step.

setup-go's implicit cache is disabled in `ci.yml`. Build keys are
`codeaf-go-v1-<namespace>-build-<os>-<arch>-<go version>-<UTC date>` for light,
tui3, session, codeaf and rest, with no SHA. The undated restore prefix chooses
the newest compatible cache, whatever its age; legs then fall back to light's
prefix. The first dev push of each UTC day that misses the exact key saves;
later exact hits do not, and PRs never save. Modules use
`codeaf-go-v1-modules-<os>-<arch>-<go version>-<hashFiles(go.sum)>`, restore
without the hash, and are saved only by light on a dev push that misses the key.
Every touched leg runs `go mod download` after restoring caches and before
testing: it compiles only part of the tree, but offline module-listing tests
such as codeaf-notices need all dependencies available. Light builds the whole
tree and continues saving the shared module cache.
At most five build namespaces a day plus one module entry per go.sum cost about
2 GB a day at the measured ~385 MB; GitHub's least-recently-used eviction at the
10 GB repository limit removes old days without any pruning script. Cache
saves remain useful even after a test failure. Hosted scheduling, cache hits
and archive sizes still need an actual workflow run to confirm.

This is pull-request parity, not the full-tree ritual. `make check` remains for
Spark, staging, or an intentional full laptop run; it runs the whole test tree,
builds the shipped binary and enforces its size budget.

## What the full gate checks

`ci-full.yml`, seven jobs (three test shards and their one name, the six-target cross build and its one name, `remote`, `size`, and the page):

- **`full tests`** — every package, minus the ledger below, split round-robin
  across three runners. Within each runner, `make test` also runs
  `internal/tui3` and `internal/session` as concurrent test-binary shards from
  one compile; the outer three-way split still assigns each package to only one
  runner. The outer split and `-p 1` remain unchanged: they were introduced
  when the private free-plan runner had two cores and seven gigabytes and died
  under link load. The repository is public now, but this change reworks the
  PR gate rather than remeasuring the full gate.
  It runs through `make test`, so the ledger it skips and the per-shard timeout
  it carries are the Makefile's and the same as a laptop's. The timeout is
  measured, not guessed: `internal/tui3` once took about 485 seconds serial on
  this runner, and the old `8m` cut it off at the finish line and reported a
  test that had been running for two seconds as a hang (#372).
- **`page on a red nightly`** — a scheduled run reports to nobody, and every
  nightly before 2026-09-02 had been red unseen. So a red night opens one issue,
  or adds the night's run to the one already open, and that issue is what
  somebody sees in the morning. Whoever makes the nightly green closes it.
- **`cross build`** — all six shipped targets compile. The only job here whose
  answer is identical on every machine and every run, which is why it is the one
  that blocks a promotion.
- **`remote`** — `make test-remote`, three containers sharing no path, no home
  and no credential. Skips green where there is no docker.
- **`size (informational)`** — prints the binary's weight next to `SIZE-BUDGET`
  and does not fail. The budget was set on linux/arm64 and the runner is
  linux/amd64, so the two numbers are not comparable; making this block means
  first agreeing which architecture the budget is measured on. `make check` on
  your own machine still enforces it, and `PERF.md` still governs changing it.

## The race detector, which no gate runs

No gate in this repository runs `go test -race`. Not the light gate, not
`touched packages` (so not `check`), not `full tests` on the nightly or on the
way into `staging`, not the release surface tests. The greps say so plainly:
`grep -rn race .github/workflows/ Makefile scripts/laws.sh` finds the word only
inside "traces", in a comment about panic output — there is no `-race` flag in
CI to find, and no gate to name.

**So a green gate proves nothing about data races, and this page is where that
is said rather than assumed.** The detector makes a test run two to twenty
times slower and five to ten times fatter, by Go's own estimate, and `full
tests` retains its conservative three-way split from the private-runner era.
It is also not the light gate's kind of question: a race is a window
between two goroutines, so its answer is not the same on every machine — #957
needed `-count=5` to be sure its quiet first run was quiet. What that trade
cost is on the record there: the detector went red on clean `dev`, on a fixture
that moved the goal owner's clock past its lock while the wall clock read it
under the lock, through a merge whose every check was green. That race was
test-only, and no gate output anywhere said so or said otherwise.

So the detector is run by hand, over the package and the tests a report names:

```sh
go test -race -count=5 -run '^TestADoneEndingNamesTheCheckItCouldNotRun$' ./internal/session/
```

It answers for that package at that moment and nothing else. The known-red
ledger below does not cover this either: it holds tests that fail, not checks
that never run.

## The known-red ledger — burned to zero

There is no ledger any more. `.github/known-red.txt` listed tests that failed on
a clean tree so `make test` could skip them by name and red could still mean
this change did it. Ruled 2026-09-02 that it only shrank, in its own wave, every
entry fixed for real or deleted with a written ruling, and no new entry allowed
after; #408 took the first five out, and the burn finished on 2026-09-12 when
the last entry — the lockdefer scan — was fixed and the file and its
`internal/ci` ratchet test were deleted together (#1012).

The Makefile and laws runner still read the ledger's old location as the
owner's guard, with their existing comments and skip flags; the file remains
absent and skips nothing. The touched classifier explicitly clears those flags
and never skips by name, using bounded attribution instead. Full/nightly runs
retain their strict first-run result. A failure on a clean tree today is a bug
report, not a line to add back — the ledger does not return.

## A test that fails only beside another suite

It is a bug report, and it never goes on the ledger above. Reproduce it under
load — a focused `-count=50` at `GOMAXPROCS=2` with a few `yes > /dev/null`
beside it, **on the bench host and never on a work machine**, since the point is to starve
the machine — and fix the CAUSE, which is almost always that the test measured
the SCHEDULER and called it the road:

- **Wait on the fact, never on a figure.** A fixed number of scripted rounds, a
  margin between two wall-clock numbers, slack "to one short of the next mark" —
  each of those is green on a quiet machine and red beside another suite, and
  widening one is not a fix.
- **A reading beside the work is waited on through the door that owns it.** A
  scripted conversation answers in no time and never blocks, so a reading the
  turn has just started may not have been scheduled at all; `internal/session`'s
  `besideWatch` (sidecar.go) is told by `readBeside` itself when each reading
  under a turn's context starts and lands, and a fixture that opts in
  (`watchReadings`) answers only once none is in flight. The product carries no
  watch, and a law test fails the build if it ever does.
- **A scripted arm orders itself by a signal.** `internal/lane/lanestub`'s
  `StallUntil` holds a stalled answer on a channel and `FirstTokenUntil` holds
  the first word the same way, both after the scripted wait is spent — so a
  primary that must answer *after* the caller has acted says exactly that,
  rather than being scripted a few milliseconds past a bound a busy machine
  eats.
- **Never fix a test with `t.Skip`, a retry loop or a wider timeout.** A bound
  is for failing honestly when the fact never arrives. The touched gate's ONE
  diagnostic retry and base probe attribute the failure while keeping it owned;
  they do not repair a test or authorize rerunning until green.

## What blocks a merge

Required today: **`check`** on `dev`, **`cross build`** on `staging` and `main`.
Those are the two check names whose green is trustworthy right now.

`full tests` and `remote` run and report, and are deliberately not required yet —
neither has been seen green in this repository's CI twice in a row, and a
required check that has never passed blocks all work on its first day.
`touched packages` is required through `check` since 2026-09-03. **Promote them by
adding their job names to `required_status_checks` in
`.github/rulesets/promotion-pointers.json` as soon as each has been green twice
in a row.** That is the next piece of work here, not a someday.

## When GitHub enforces it

The repository is now public, so the free plan's former private-repository
restriction no longer prevents branch rules. `.github/rulesets/` holds the
intended rules; inspect live enforcement before assuming they were applied.
