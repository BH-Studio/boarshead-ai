"""compare.py — the regression verdict at a glance.

Reads bench-results/e2e.csv and answers the two questions the battery exists
for: did this run move against the last one, and how does it sit against the
peer harness on the same task.

Nothing here recomputes anything. Every number is a number some cell already
measured and wrote down; this only subtracts them and says which way.

Invoked as `bench/e2e/run.sh compare`.

# A move smaller than these is noise, not a regression.
#
# The two numbers are different because the two quantities are. Cost is a sum of
# billed tokens and moves only when the run does more work: two back-to-back
# runs of the lookup cell came in at $0.001992 and $0.0022, about 10% apart.
# Wall clock also carries queueing, provider latency and whatever else the
# machine is doing, and the same two runs took 15s and 24s — a 60% "regression"
# between two runs of identical code.
#
# So the wall threshold is set above that observed spread deliberately. A
# battery that reports a regression every time it is run twice teaches its
# reader to ignore it, and then it is guarding nothing. Real wall regressions in
# this engine's history have been multiples — the abcc5a5 window-sizing defect
# was 3.2x — and those clear any threshold in this range.
