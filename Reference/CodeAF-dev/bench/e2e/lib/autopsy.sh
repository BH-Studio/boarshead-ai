# autopsy.sh — reading a finished run out of the store it left behind.
#
# `codeaf do --keep` prints "store kept at <dir>" on stderr and leaves a SQLite
# journal at <dir>/graph.db. Every question this battery asks about a run's
# *shape* — how many nodes, which route, did the leaves start together, what did
# it cost — is answered from that journal rather than from the run's own prose,
# for the same reason bench/run.sh reads pytest instead of the harness's summary:
# the thing being measured does not get to grade itself.
#
# The journal is WAL-mode, so every read here opens it read-only via a file: URI.
# Opening it read-write would checkpoint the WAL and mutate the evidence.
#
# Sourced by run.sh. Every function takes the db path as its first argument.

# store_dir_of extracts the kept store's directory from a captured stderr log.
# The line is written only when the store was ephemeral and --keep was given.

# q runs one query and prints the raw result. An unreadable store is an empty
# answer, never a crash: a cell whose run died before it wrote a journal must
# still be able to record that fact in the CSV.
#
# The read-only open is tried first, and it is tried through a file: URI because
# that is the only way to ask sqlite3 for one. It can legitimately fail: a
# WAL-mode database whose -wal and -shm sidecars are still present needs to
# recover them before it can answer anything, and recovery is a write. A store
# read in place immediately after the engine let go of it is exactly that case,
# and it fails by returning nothing rather than by erroring — which is how an
# autopsy silently reports a healthy run as zero nodes and no route.
#
# So a read-only open that comes back empty on a file that exists falls through
# to an ordinary one. Callers stow the store before reading it (see run.sh), so
# by then the copy belongs to the battery and checkpointing it costs nothing.
