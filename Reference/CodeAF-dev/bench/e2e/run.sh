# Run the end-to-end regression battery: one scratch directory per cell, one
# harness invocation, then an autopsy of the journal the run left behind and a
# set of assertions that the run does not get to grade.
#
# This spends real money and is ON DEMAND. It is deliberately not wired into
# `make check` and must never be: `make check` is a thing you run before every
# commit, and this is a thing you run when you have changed the tasker and want
# to know what it cost you.
#
# Read bench/e2e/README.md before trusting a row, in particular the model pin —
# the codeaf and peer arms name the same model two different ways, and the
# runner refuses to compare them unless it can show they are the same model.
#
# Usage:
#   bench/e2e/run.sh                        every cell, codeaf arm
#   bench/e2e/run.sh --cells lookup         one cell
#   bench/e2e/run.sh --arm pi               the same tasks through pi
#   bench/e2e/run.sh --dry-run              compose every invocation, run none
#   bench/e2e/run.sh compare                latest vs previous, per cell

# The model pin, in two spellings of one model.
#
# E2E_MODEL is what codeaf is given. The leading `~` is codeaf's own alias
# syntax for a floating tag and is not an OpenRouter model id; it is also
# codeaf's shipped default (internal/config/config.go, DefaultModel), which is
# the point — the battery measures the tasker as configured, not as specially
# tuned for a benchmark.
#
# E2E_PEER_MODEL is what pi and opencode are given, because neither understands
# codeaf's alias syntax: passing the `~` form to pi returns
# `400 ... is not a valid model ID`. It is the concrete slug that alias serves,
# recorded in bench/probelab/REPORT.md.
#
# Changing either without changing the other silently compares two models and
# makes every historical row in e2e.csv incomparable. The `model` column exists
# so that can be seen rather than assumed, and the peer arms refuse to run when
# the pin cannot be verified — see require_peer_model.
