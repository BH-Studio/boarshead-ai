# The arm-fair rule: the arms of a task start within seconds of each other so
# provider weather falls on all of them or none. Each cell holds a container with
# the task's own reservation (4 CPUs, 16 GB here) plus a two-CPU scorer once an
# hour, so three arms is already most of a twenty-CPU machine — this fires one
# task's arms and nothing else.
