"""record.py — one SWE-Marathon cell's record.json, from the container's leavings.

Nothing here is read from a harness's own account of itself. The verdict is the
verifier's metrics.json; the road columns come from the v3 store the profile bind
mount left on the host; and the money is TOKENS × THE ONE OPENROUTER LIST TABLE
for all three arms, never a harness's self-reported dollars. A harness's own
figure is kept beside it as `native_usd` — for the record, not for the comparison.

Usage: record.py <cell> <arm> <task> <seed> <wall_s> <harness_exit> <verify_wall_s> <verify_exit>
