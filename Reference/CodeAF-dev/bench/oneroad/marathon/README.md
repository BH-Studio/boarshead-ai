# bench/oneroad/marathon — one SWE-Marathon task, three harnesses, one price table

The task is [`rust-java-lsp`](https://github.com/abundant-ai/swe-marathon) (paper
arXiv 2606.07682): build a Java language server in Rust from scratch whose JSON
responses match Eclipse JDT-LS across ~68,000 test points on 1,007 real Java
files, in ten hours. `difficulty = "hard"`, `expert_time_estimate_hours = 20`.

Three arms, one model — `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` over OpenRouter:

| arm | what it is |
| --- | --- |
| `codeaf-crew` | `codeaf chat --yolo --model …` in a real TTY, **registry tiers** — the reader, division and repair roles resolve to their own tiers, exactly as `swe/cell.sh`'s crew arm does |
| `codeaf-flash` | the same, with every tier collapsed onto the one model (`models.tiers.*`) |
| `pi` | `pi -p --provider openrouter --model …` |
| `opencode` | `opencode run --auto -m openrouter/…` |

## Running it

```bash
# build the image once (plain ubuntu:24.04 + rustup 1.86.0; no arm64 patch needed)
docker build -t swe-marathon/rust-java-lsp:v1.1 \
  -f <repo>/tasks/rust-java-lsp/environment/Dockerfile <repo>/tasks/rust-java-lsp/environment

bash preflight.sh rust-java-lsp        # ALWAYS FIRST: proves the toolchain and the egress allowlist
bash cell.sh <arm> rust-java-lsp        # one cell, the task's own 10 h wall
bash wave.sh rust-java-lsp codeaf-crew pi opencode   # all three, arm-fair
bash rescore.sh s6 1                    # an out-of-band honest score of a LIVE cell
```

`preflight.sh` builds a throwaway container the way `cell.sh` builds a real one
and asserts the two things that are invisible from inside a run and fatal to its
row — which compiler the agent is holding and what the network reaches. It takes
about a minute and it has already caught the defect described under **The
toolchain** below. Run it after any change to `cell.sh` or `netlock.sh`, and
before any wave whose numbers are going to be quoted.

The three 10 h cells of 2026-08-25 were launched as:

```bash
cd ~/af-oneroad/bench/oneroad/marathon
CODEAF_BUILD_COMMIT=6e956a1a nohup bash wave.sh rust-java-lsp codeaf-crew pi opencode \
  > ~/af-bench/marathon/.wave.out 2>&1 &
```

To launch the codeaf arm alone against a freshly built binary — the crew config
is the default, so nothing is pinned:

```bash
cd ~/af-oneroad/bench/oneroad/marathon
CODEAF_BUILD_COMMIT=<commit the binary was built from> \
NEW_BIN=~/af-oneroad/bin/codeaf \
nohup bash cell.sh codeaf-crew rust-java-lsp > ~/af-bench/marathon/.codeaf.out 2>&1 &
# watch it:  tmux attach -t oneroad-mar-codeaf-crew-rust-java-lsp-s1
```

`CODEAF_BUILD_COMMIT` is the binary's own provenance and is recorded beside its
sha256. It is not the same thing as the repository's HEAD: several lanes share
this checkout and HEAD moves under a ten-hour cell, so the record keeps both
(`build_commit` and `repo_commit_at_record`).

**s2, codeaf-crew only, to be launched when the new binary lands** — fill in the
commit the binary was built from and check the sha it prints:

```bash
cd ~/af-oneroad/bench/oneroad/marathon
sha256sum ~/af-oneroad/bin/codeaf            # confirm it is the new build
SEED=s2 CODEAF_BUILD_COMMIT=<new build commit> NEW_BIN=~/af-oneroad/bin/codeaf \
  nohup bash cell.sh codeaf-crew rust-java-lsp \
  > ~/af-bench/marathon/.codeaf-s2.out 2>&1 &
# watch:  tmux attach -t oneroad-mar-codeaf-crew-rust-java-lsp-s2
# tail:   tail -f ~/af-bench/marathon/codeaf-crew-rust-java-lsp-s2/cell.log
```

Everything else is the s1 configuration unchanged: same task, same
`deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`, same 36000 s wall, same 4 CPUs / 16 GB, same
crew (registry tiers) config, hourly curve. `SNAPSHOT_OFFSET` is not needed for a
single cell.

Knobs, all with the task's own value as the default: `SEED`, `CELL_SECONDS`
(default `[agent] timeout_sec` = 36000), `SILENCE_SECONDS` (900), `SNAPSHOT_EVERY`
(3600, `0` disables the curve), `SNAPSHOT_TIMEOUT` (1800), `MODEL`, `NEW_BIN`,
`MARATHON_REPO`, `IMAGE`, `MAR_OUT`, `NETLOCK` (1; `0` runs on full egress and
says so in the record), `NETLOCK_REFRESH` (30 s). There is no toolchain knob:
the agent's compiler is whatever the agent chose, and everything else follows it.

Artifacts land in `~/af-bench/marathon/<arm>-<task>-<seed>/`, and `_results` here
is a **symlink** to `~/af-bench/marathon`. That is not tidiness: a cell's bind
mounts are root-owned while it runs, and a root-owned directory anywhere under
the repository breaks `go build ./...` and `internal/config`'s registry test,
whose `filepath.Walk` does not follow symlinks.

## The shape, and why

**tmux on the host, driving `docker exec -it`.** No image is derived, nothing is
apt-installed into the dataset's container, and the pane is a real TTY. The
profile directory is a bind mount from the cell's own host directory, so the
journal the settle detector polls and `lib/road.py` reads is on the host at a
path the existing readers already understand.

**PID 1 is the clock.** `environment/timer.sh` reports `36000 - $(ps -o etimes= -p 1)`,
so `--entrypoint sleep … infinity` makes `bash /app/timer.sh` correct for free —
the same thing Harbor's own container does. The cell records what the timer said
at t=0 (`timer-at-start.txt`, `"Remaining time (hours:minutes): 10:00"`).

**Nothing from `tests/` or `solution/` is mounted while the agent runs.**
`tests/holdout/golden.jsonl` **is** the hidden test set and `solution/` is the
oracle; an agent that can read either has been handed the answer. The container
is created with no `/tests` at all — `oracle-absent.txt` in every cell is the
container's own `ls` proving it — and `tests/` is `docker cp`'d in only after the
harness has been reaped. Docker cannot add a bind mount to a live container, and
the copy is the honest equivalent: same container, same filesystem, staged after
the agent can no longer read anything.

**The harness is killed inside the container before the verifier runs.** Killing
the tmux session only kills the `docker exec` *client*; the process it started
lives on as an orphan, and an orphan holding a `cargo build` would fight the
verifier for the same `target/` and the same four CPUs.

**The agent's own score is not the verifier's.** The image ships `run_tests.sh`,
which writes `/logs/verifier/reward.txt` and `metrics.json` against the **visible**
corpus. Everything the agent left in `/logs` is moved to `/logs/agent-phase/`
before `tests/test.sh` runs — kept, because what the agent believed about its own
progress is evidence, just never the verdict.

**The agent's toolchain and the agent's network are the runner's job, and both
were once wrong.** The agent and the verifier share one rustup state on the
image's own paths, so an upgrade the agent makes is inherited rather than
forbidden; the container reaches only the hosts `task.toml` names plus the model
endpoint. See **The toolchain** and **The network** below; `preflight.sh` proves
both against a throwaway container before a wave is launched.

**The verifier runs whole.** Unlike the SWE track — where three of five stages are
LLM judges we have no key for — marathon's is entirely deterministic: rebuild,
`anti_cheat.py`, `verify_integrity.py`, the cached-golden scan, decrypt the
pristine golden with the key embedded in `test.sh`, score the visible corpus, score
the holdout, merge. Nothing is skipped and the verdict is the benchmark's own.
Timeout `[verifier] timeout_sec` = 3600 s, and the whole hour can genuinely be
needed: `score_golden.py` gives each of the 68,186 requests its own 30-second
deadline, so a server that **answers** is scored in seconds (the s1 codeaf cell:
6 s) while one that **hangs** can burn the full budget. Both outcomes are real
readings, not runner faults.

**The per-method table is kept before it is overwritten.** `score_golden.py`
writes `partial_score, pass_rate, passed, total, per_method` to
`/logs/verifier/metrics.json` — and then `test.sh`'s holdout merge **replaces**
that file with a summary that has no `per_method` in it. `verify.sh` copies the
first complete file aside as `metrics_main.json` (first writing wins, and a
half-written file is rejected by a `json.loads` guard). `record.py` falls back to
parsing the table `score_golden.py` printed to the log.

## The settle rule

Exactly the SWE track's: the cell ends at the wall, or earlier only when the
store has been quiet for `SILENCE_SECONDS` **and** — for the codeaf arms — no task
is live per `lib/tasklive.py`. Both readings are taken **inside** the container:
the harness runs as root and creates its session folder mode 700, so from the
host the profile is unreadable, `find` returns nothing with no error, and a
fingerprint of nothing is perfectly stable from the first poll — a cell reading
from the host would settle blind no matter what the agent was doing.

`SILENCE_SECONDS` is **900 here, not 180**. The SWE track's three minutes suits a
forty-five minute wall; this wall is ten hours and one `cargo build --release` of
a tree-sitter grammar runs for minutes with nothing written to the store.

**The fingerprint must not see the heartbeats.** codeaf's standing-work ticker
appends one line to `/prof/v3/standing/wake.log` every **300 s** for as long as
the profile is open — and the line it writes when there is nothing to do says so
itself: `examined=0 checked=0 fired=0 said=0`. A fingerprint over the whole store
was therefore reset every five minutes by a record of *nothing happening*, so
`stable` could never reach 900 and `quiet` could never reach the 2700-second
escape hatch either. **The s1 codeaf cell's settle rule was arithmetically
unreachable**: it went idle at 12:14 with its only task landed and would have run
to the ten-hour wall. `presence.json` and everything under `standing/` are now
excluded — both are the harness reporting that it is *alive*, which is the
opposite of the question being asked. Everything a turn or a worker writes
(`transcript.jsonl`, `tasks.json`, `tasks/*.jsonl`, `logs/jobs/*`) still counts,
so a wake that starts real work still registers, in the files that work writes.

`lib/tasklive.py` was **not** at fault: it counts `unverified` as landed, as its
`LANDED` set says, and reported `live 0` correctly throughout.

**A signal ends a cell.** `trap cleanup EXIT INT TERM` runs `cleanup` on TERM and
then *resumes the script* — the container is gone but the settle loop keeps
polling a name that no longer resolves, reads an empty fingerprint as a stable
one, settles on it, and writes a record over the record already there. It is now
`trap cleanup EXIT` plus `trap 'cleanup; exit 130' INT TERM`.

### finish.sh — ending a cell that is already up

`bash finish.sh <arm> <task> <seed> "<reason>"` performs cell.sh's own ending
from outside: reap the harness, stage `tests/`, run the verifier, hand the files
back, write the record, then release `cell.sh` so its `cleanup` tears the cell
down. It exists because the two obvious rescues are both wrong — **editing
cell.sh in place** corrupts a running bash, which reads a script incrementally
from a byte offset (the verify-and-record tail is exactly what would be
misparsed), and **killing cell.sh** takes the container, and the workspace the
verifier has to score, with it. It never touches `/workspace`: a worker's own
arrangement in there is part of the container state the benchmark scores, and a
runner that tidies before judging is scoring something the agent did not leave.

Outcomes: `OK` (settled, every task landed) · `OK(wall)` (wall reached but work
landed — the clock ran out, the attempt did not) · `DNF` (wall reached with
nothing landed) · `STRANDED` (settled with a task live but silent past
`ONEROAD_STRANDED_SECONDS`) · `KILLED` (the harness died on a signal) ·
`INVALID` (the verifier produced no metrics.json at all — recorded as *no score*,
never as a zero).

"Work landed" has no diff to measure here: this task ships no git repository. The
image ships exactly one file in the working directory (`run_tests.sh`), so
`verify.sh` lists the workspace at the moment of judgement and anything above one
file is the agent's own.

## The progress curve

`snapshot.sh` runs beside the cell. Every `SNAPSHOT_EVERY` seconds it streams the
workspace out as a tar (**without** `target/`, which is build output and can be
gigabytes) and scores it in a **short-lived container of its own** from the same
image, on two CPUs, killed at `SNAPSHOT_TIMEOUT`. Scoring in the agent's own
container would hand its four CPUs to a release build and a 68,000-point scoring
run several times over a ten-hour cell, and every curve point would be paid for
out of the result it measures. A per-cell docker volume holds the snapshot
builds' cargo registry so each hour's build is not a fresh download; the agent's
container never sees it, so nothing is warmed for the run under test. A second
per-cell volume at `/root/.rustup` holds the toolchains, for the same reason and
with one extra: the scorer must **adopt the agent's compiler** before it builds
(see **The toolchain**), and without a cache that would be a fresh download every
hour.

`curve.csv` (`csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL`): `elapsed_s, partial_score, passed, total,
reward, note`. The `note` column always carries the rustc the row was scored with
(`rustc 1.98.0 (…)`), because two rows taken with different compilers are two
different measurements and a reader must not have to guess which. A snapshot that fails to copy, fails to start, or runs out of its
half hour writes a row with `partial_score` 0 **and the reason**, and goes back to
sleep. Nothing in that loop can take the cell down.

**The whole of `/workspace` travels, not the crate — and the first three s1 curve
points are what that mistake looks like.** The snapshot copied only the crate
leaf, on the reasoning that the crate is the work. It is not what the benchmark
scores: `score_golden.py` addresses every test point as
`file:///workspace/test-files/<rel>`, and the s1 worker met that by creating
`/workspace/test-files -> /workspace/java` — one symlink, one level **above** the
crate, therefore outside the copy. Three hourly points came back `0/68186` from a
server that was answering correctly for 132 of them.

Replayed both ways against the s1 crate, in the scoring container, with the
verifier's own `test.sh`:

| snapshot path | main | holdout | partial |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| old (crate leaf only) | 0/68186 | 0/276 | 0.0 |
| **new (whole `/workspace`, symlinks preserved)** | **132/68186** | **29/276** | **0.0535** |

The new path reproduces the real verifier's verdict on the live container
exactly. The tar carries no `-h`, so a symlink stays a symlink — following it
would replace a one-byte link with a second copy of the corpus and, worse, hide
whether the agent's arrangement actually works. The image's `/workspace` is
removed before the agent's is unpacked over it, so the scorer never judges a
blend of two workspaces that never existed. Excluded: `target/` (the verifier
rebuilds it), `.git`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `.venv`.

Because the corpus now travels too, the snapshot **can** show the integrity and
cached-golden failures the real verifier would find — it hashes the agent's own
`java/` and `golden.jsonl`, exactly as the benchmark does (checked: `Integrity:
PASSED (1008 files match manifest)` on the replay). The corpus is left out of the
*unpacked* host-side copy only, since ten identical copies per cell of the
dataset's own thirty megabytes is the one thing on this disk that would grow for
no reason.

The curve is still **indicative, not the verdict** — it is a point in time, and
only the end-of-cell verifier runs against the container the agent actually left.

## The record

`record.json` per cell: arm, harness version (codeaf: repo commit + binary
sha256 + which tier config; pi/opencode: their `--version`), model, image id and
ref, task repo commit, started/ended/wall/verify wall, outcome and settle reason,
reward, partial_score, pass_rate, passed/total, holdout block, `per_method`,
the `toolchain` block (the image's toolchain and rustc, the toolchain the AGENT
ended on, which rustup store it came from, and `split_home` for the cells whose
store our own bug misplaced), `network_deviation` as the cell computed it,
tokens in/out/cached, requests, `cost_usd`, workspace file count, the timer's
reading at t=0, the curve, and for the codeaf arms the road summary from
`lib/road.py` (marks, ceiling decision, divisions, parts, peak concurrency).

**One price table for all three arms is the law.** `cost_usd` is always
tokens × the OpenRouter list price for the pinned model
(`lib/competitor_cost.py:list_prices`), computed from each harness's own usage
records — codeaf's `call` journal lines via `lib/codeaf_list_cost.py`, pi's
session jsonl and opencode's sqlite store via `lib/competitor_cost.py`. What a
harness believed it spent is recorded beside it as `native_usd`, for the record
and never for the comparison.

The peer arms run with `HOME=/peer`, which is bind-mounted out so their stores can
be read afterwards. `/peer` is deliberately **not** under `/tmp`, `/root`, `/home`
or `/workspace`: `tests/test.sh`'s cached-golden scan walks exactly those four for
`.json`/`.jsonl` files over 1 MB, and a harness store that happened to hold a
large one would otherwise read as a cheat that never happened.

## The toolchain: inheritance, not a pin

The image installs rust as root — `curl … | sh -s -- -y --default-toolchain 1.86.0
--profile minimal` — into `/root/.rustup` and `/root/.cargo`, with
`ENV PATH="/root/.cargo/bin:$PATH"`. `tests/test.sh` exports exactly that PATH and
runs under `docker exec` as root, so **the verifier reads `/root/.rustup`**.

### What the benchmark actually allows

`task.toml`'s allowlist includes `static.rust-lang.org`, for the agent phase and
the verifier phase alike, and officially the agent runs as root with `HOME=/root`.
So `rustup default stable` is a **legal move**, and because the verifier runs in
the *same container* off the *same* `/root/.rustup`, it **inherits** the agent's
choice. The compiler the agent picked is the compiler the agent is judged with.

That is not a loophole to be closed. It is close to unavoidable: `lsp-types`
depends on `url`, any fresh resolution today lands on `url 2.5.8` → `idna` →
`icu 2.3`, and that needs rustc ≥ 1.88 while the image ships 1.86.0. **Two of the
six live seeds (s6, s8) already have such a lockfile.** A runner that forbids the
upgrade makes the obvious crate unusable and scores a legitimate workspace 0.0.

### What our runner broke

The cell ran the agent with `HOME=/chome` — the right instinct, keeping the
harness's dotfiles out of `/root` — and rustup finds its store through
`$HOME/.rustup`. So the agent's first `rustc --version` answered:

```
error: rustup could not choose a version of rustc to run, because one wasn't
specified explicitly, and no default is configured.
help: run 'rustup default stable' to download the latest stable release …
```

Every model did what the help text said, and the install landed in
`/chome/.rustup`, where `tests/test.sh` could never see it. **The inheritance was
broken, not the upgrade.** Seed s6 built all day against a compiler the verifier
did not have and scored 0.0.

### The fix

Three environment variables on the agent's `docker exec`, keeping `HOME=/chome`:

| variable | value | why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RUSTUP_HOME` | `/root/.rustup` | the store the verifier reads |
| `CARGO_HOME` | `/root/.cargo` | the registry and the shims the verifier reads |
| `PATH` | `tests/test.sh`'s PATH, verbatim | `cargo` is found where the verifier finds it |

That is all. One rustup state, shared by agent and verifier, exactly as
officially — and **nothing is pinned**.

An earlier version of this work *did* pin the agent to the image's toolchain with
`RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN`. It was wrong, and it is worth saying why, because it looked
safe: it guaranteed the cell, the verifier and the hourly curve all used one
compiler. But it bought that agreement by making this runner **stricter than the
benchmark** — an agent that upgraded legally would have been compiled with 1.86.0
anyway, and a `url 2.5.8` lockfile would have failed in the cell rather than
building. Wrong in the opposite direction from the original defect, and just as
invisible. Agreement has to come from *following* the agent's choice, not from
removing it.

### Everything that compiles this workspace adopts the agent's compiler

`toolchain.sh detect <container>` answers "what is this cell's default toolchain,
and which store is it in", and it is the single place that decides:

* **the verifier** — `cell.sh` and `finish.sh` hand its `RUSTUP_HOME`/`CARGO_HOME`
  to the verifier's `docker exec`. For a cell run after the fix these are the
  image's own defaults and change nothing.
* **the hourly curve** — `snapshot.sh` re-detects every hour (the agent can
  upgrade at any point in ten hours) and runs
  `rustup toolchain install --profile minimal <tc> && rustup default <tc>` in its
  scorer container before `cargo build`. The rustc it actually used is written
  into the curve row's `note` column, so two rows taken with different compilers
  read as the different measurements they are.
* **an out-of-band reading** — `rescore.sh` does the same.

The scorer's toolchains live in a **per-cell docker volume mounted at
`/root/.rustup`**. A named volume is populated from the image on first use, so the
scorer starts with the shipped 1.86.0 already present and downloads only the delta
the agent chose — measured here at about five seconds for the first snapshot of a
cell and **0 s for every one after** (`preflight.sh` asserts the second adoption
takes under 20 s). Two toolchains cost about 950 MB of volume per cell;
`snapshot.sh` removes both of its volumes when the cell ends.

`toolchain.sh` looks at `/chome/.rustup` **before** `/root/.rustup`, and that is
for the six cells launched before this: their agents upgraded into `/chome`, so
that store is what they compiled with, and it is the official-equivalent state —
the same upgrade, written to the wrong path by our runner. `finish.sh` points the
verifier at it and `record.json`'s `toolchain` block carries `split_home: true`
and says so in words. New cells have no `/chome/.rustup` at all.

### `rescore.sh` — an honest reading of a live cell

```bash
bash rescore.sh s6 3          # the third out-of-band reading of seed s6
```

Copies the running cell's `/workspace` **with the droppings stripped** — no
`target/` (build output the verifier rebuilds), no `.git`, no `.codeaf` (the
harness's own store, which the agent happened to write inside the working
directory and which is no part of the work being judged) — scores it in a
short-lived two-CPU container with the agent's toolchain adopted, and appends a
row to `<MAR_OUT>/rescore/<arm>-<task>-<seed>/curve.txt`. `<n>` is just the
sequence number of the reading. Output goes **beside** the cell, never inside it:
a live cell's directory is being read by `record.py` and `road.py` while it runs.

Its caches (`oneroad-mar-{cargo,rustup}-rescore-<seed>`) are deliberately kept
between runs and are the only volumes here that are not cleaned up automatically.

One consequence of `CARGO_HOME=/root/.cargo` worth stating: the crate registry now
lands under `/root`, which `tests/test.sh`'s cached-golden scan walks. That is also
true of the official environment, and it is the hazard already measured at the
bottom of this file — the largest JSON a tree-sitter build leaves there is
`grammar.json` at 186 KB, an order of magnitude under the 1 MB threshold.

## The network, and what an address can and cannot say

`instruction.md` tells the agent, verbatim:

> Network access is restricted — only the package registries needed to fetch your
> crate dependencies are reachable; all other internet egress is blocked.

and `task.toml` names the hosts, identically for the agent and the verifier
phase: `crates.io`, `index.crates.io`, `static.crates.io`, `github.com`,
`static.rust-lang.org`. Cells before this ran on docker's default bridge with
full egress, which made that sentence in the prompt **false**.

`netlock.sh` writes the policy with the **host's** iptables into the
**container's** network namespace (`nsenter -t <pid> -n`). Two other mechanisms
were considered and rejected:

* **An HTTP proxy on an `--internal` docker network.** Enforces perfectly, but
  only for clients that honour `HTTPS_PROXY`. node's undici (`pi`) and opencode's
  runtime do not by default, so the peer arms would lose their model endpoint and
  die. A policy only half the arms obey is a bias, not a policy.
* **iptables inside the container with `--cap-add NET_ADMIN`.** The image is plain
  ubuntu:24.04 and ships no iptables, so this means `apt-get install` into the
  image under test. The whole point of this runner is that the dataset's image is
  the one measured.

The netns approach adds no capability to the container, installs nothing in it,
and puts no proxy variable in its environment — every process in it, in whatever
language, is filtered by the kernel. The last rule is `REJECT`, not `DROP`, so a
blocked connection fails in about 50 ms and the agent's tool reports a refused
connection instead of hanging on a timeout it cannot see.

**Allowed, and nothing else:**

| host | why |
| --- | --- |
| `index.crates.io`, `static.crates.io`, `crates.io` | `task.toml` `[agent].allowed_hosts` |
| `github.com` | `task.toml` — cargo git dependencies |
| `static.rust-lang.org` | `task.toml` |
| `openrouter.ai` | the model API. `task.toml`'s own note: "Oddish adds only the selected model API endpoint to the agent phase" |

plus DNS to the container's own resolvers, and loopback. IPv6 is refused
outright.

**What an address-based allowlist cannot express.** `index.crates.io`,
`static.crates.io` and `static.rust-lang.org` all resolve to the *same* Fastly
address (151.101.138.137, measured here). No address filter can allow the crate
registries and refuse the toolchain server; separating them needs SNI inspection.
It costs nothing, because `static.rust-lang.org` is on the benchmark's own
allowlist and because the toolchain pin above makes an installed compiler
inert. `github.com` round-robins across a block, so `140.82.112.0/20` —
GitHub's own published git/codeload range — is allowed rather than a single
resolved address; the Fastly and Cloudflare names are allowed by address, because
`151.101.0.0/16` is shared Fastly space that would let through half the internet.

The watcher re-resolves every 30 s and only ever **adds** addresses; removing one
would cut a live `cargo` connection for no reason. It also re-installs the whole
policy if it ever finds the rules gone.

`preflight.sh` step 3 is the proof, from inside the container:

is curl failing to connect at all.)

A failure to install the allowlist is **fatal to the cell**. A run that quietly
fell back to full egress would be a run whose prompt lies to the agent and whose
row cannot be compared with a leaderboard number.

### Cells run before this

**Seeds s4–s9, launched 2026-08-25/26, ran on the open default bridge and with the
split toolchain.** Their agents saw the rustup error and installed their own
stable into `/chome/.rustup`. Their egress was not the task's allowlist, and their
rows are not comparable on that count with rows produced after this commit;
`record.json` for each of them carries the honest `network_deviation` sentence
("default docker bridge, full egress"), which `finish.sh` now reads off the
container rather than assuming.

Their **toolchain**, though, is recoverable rather than ruined. The upgrade those
agents made is legal and is what the official run would also have had — it simply
landed in `/chome/.rustup` instead of `/root/.rustup`. So `finish.sh` points the
verifier at `/chome/.rustup` for exactly these cells (`toolchain.sh` checks it
first), and `rescore.sh` adopts the same toolchain in its scorer. That is how s6
and s8 — whose lockfiles pin `url 2.5.8` → `idna` → `icu 2.3` and need rustc ≥
1.88 — get read at their real score instead of a build failure.

The **snapshot scorer's scoring was not changed**: it still builds in a fresh
container of the image from a tarball of the workspace, which is what makes it an
outside reading rather than the cell's own opinion of itself. What changed is
only *which compiler* it installs before building — the agent's, re-detected every
hour — because a scorer stuck on 1.86.0 would have reported 0.0 for a workspace
the benchmark scores properly, and a curve that under-reads is worse than no
curve. It also remains outside the egress allowlist (a snapshot container has full
egress, and must, to install that toolchain and fetch crates), which changes no
score: it only ever builds and scores a tarball, and never runs the agent.

## Deviations from the benchmark, stated

1. **The egress allowlist is the task's, plus the model endpoint.** `netlock.sh`
   enforces `task.toml`'s five hosts and `openrouter.ai` in the container's
   network namespace; everything else is REJECTed. What REMAINS a deviation:
   `openrouter.ai` is reachable (the benchmark's own agent phase adds a model
   endpoint too, so this is a deviation in *identity* rather than in kind), the
   filter is by address so it cannot separate `static.rust-lang.org` from the
   crate registries, and `github.com` is allowed as GitHub's published
   `140.82.112.0/20` rather than one rotating address. Each cell's exact policy is
   recorded in `record.json` (`network_deviation`) and in
   `/logs/verifier/oneroad_stages.json`, computed from what the cell did rather
   than written down here. **Seeds s4–s9 predate this and ran open** — see above.
2. **The agent's compiler is not deviated from at all** — it may upgrade exactly
   as it may officially, and the verifier inherits the upgrade because they share
   one rustup state, as officially. The hourly curve is the only thing that is
   not the benchmark's: it scores in a *separate* container, so it has to be told
   which toolchain to adopt rather than inheriting it for free. See **The
   toolchain** above.
3. **No per-container storage quota.** `task.toml` asks for 20480 MB; docker's
   overlay2 on this host enforces no per-container disk quota.
4. **The wall is the runner's, measured from container start.** The container is
   created immediately before the prompt is sent, so the agent's `timer.sh`
   reading and the cell's own wall agree to within a few seconds — but the few
   seconds are the runner's, not the benchmark's.
5. **Snapshot scoring is extra load the benchmark does not have** — two CPUs and
   up to half an hour, once an hour, in a separate container. Sized to keep the
   host under its 20 CPUs with three cells running.

CPUs (4) and memory (16 GB) are the task's own, read out of `task.toml` by the
runner rather than spelled here, so this runner takes `<arm> <task>` and works for
any marathon task whose Dockerfile builds on this machine.

## Two zero shapes, and they are different facts

`tests/test.sh` runs under `set -euo pipefail`, so `cargo build --release 2>&1 |
tail -20` **failing exits the script** before it can reach `write_zero_metrics`.
That is the benchmark's own behaviour, and it means:

| the workspace | what the verifier leaves |
| --- | --- |
| no `Cargo.toml` at all | `metrics.json` with `partial_score 0.0, pass_rate 0.0, passed 0, total 0, per_method {}` and `reward.txt` `0.0` — **checked**, on an untouched container |
| a crate that does not compile | **no `metrics.json` at all**; only `reward.txt` `0.0`, written at the top of the script — **observed**, on the pi smoke (`test_sh_exit=101`) |
| a crate that compiles but whose server never answers `initialize` | the full merged `metrics.json` with `main` and `holdout` blocks at `passed 0 / total 0` — **observed**, on the codeaf smoke |

`record.py` records the second as `partial_score 0.0` with `score_source` saying
why, not as a missing score — the verifier did reach a verdict and wrote it. Only
a run with **neither** `metrics.json` nor `reward.txt` is `INVALID`.

## A hazard that was checked, not assumed

`tests/test.sh`'s cached-golden scan fails any run with a `.json`/`.jsonl` over
1 MB under `/tmp`, `/workspace`, `/root` or `/home` (outside
`/workspace/golden.jsonl` and the crate's `target/`). A tree-sitter build puts
grammar JSON into `/root/.cargo/registry/src/`, so this was measured rather than
hoped: with `tree-sitter`, `tree-sitter-java` and `serde_json` vendored, the
largest is `tree-sitter-java-0.23.5/src/grammar.json` at **186 KB** — an order of
magnitude under the threshold. A run that pulls in a crate shipping a bigger one
would be failed by the benchmark's own rule, equally, in every arm.
