#!/usr/bin/env bash
# marathon/finish.sh — end a cell that is still up, by the same road cell.sh ends one.
#
# Usage: finish.sh <arm> <task> <seed> <settle-reason>
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY. A cell whose settle rule failed to fire is sitting
# on a live container with a live verdict inside it, and the two obvious ways to
# rescue it are both wrong:
#
#   editing cell.sh in place — bash reads a script INCREMENTALLY, from a byte
#   offset it keeps as it goes, so rewriting the file under a running cell makes
#   it resume parsing at an offset that no longer means what it meant. The
#   verify-and-record tail is exactly the part that would be misparsed;
#
#   killing cell.sh — its EXIT trap tears the container down, and the workspace
#   the verifier has to score goes with it.
#
# So the ending is performed from outside, against the live container, in the
# same order and with the same steps as cell.sh's own tail — reap the harness,
# stage tests/ (never before the harness is dead), run the verifier, hand the
# files back, write the record — and only THEN is cell.sh killed, so that its own
# cleanup() performs the teardown it was always going to perform.
#
# It does not touch /workspace. A worker that made its own arrangement in there —
# the `test-files -> java` symlink this task's scorer needs, a build tree, a
# scratch file — is part of the container state the benchmark scores, and a
# runner that tidies before judging is scoring something the agent did not leave.

# have been launched before the egress allowlist and the toolchain fix existed —
# the six seeds of 2026-08-25/26 were. So neither is assumed here: the network
# policy is read from the container's own netns, and the toolchain split is read
# from the filesystem. A cell whose agent installed its own rust into
# /chome/.rustup is verified WITHOUT the pin, because 1.86.0 is not the compiler
# that workspace was built with and the benchmark's own verifier would not have
# had it either. Its 0.0 is a real reading about a real cell.
