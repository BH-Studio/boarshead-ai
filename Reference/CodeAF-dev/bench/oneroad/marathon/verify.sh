#
# UNLIKE THE SWE TRACK, THIS RUNS tests/test.sh WHOLE. The SWE verifier had to be
# taken apart because three of its five stages are LLM judges we have no key for.
# Marathon's is entirely deterministic: it rebuilds the agent's crate, scans the
# source for cheats, hashes the corpus against a pristine manifest, decrypts the
# golden with a key embedded in the script itself, scores the visible corpus and
# the holdout, and writes reward.txt and metrics.json. Nothing here needs a model,
# so nothing here is skipped and the verdict is the benchmark's own, unedited.
#
# This script only does the three things test.sh cannot do for itself: move the
# AGENT's leavings out of /logs first, keep the main corpus's per-method table
# before the holdout merge overwrites it, and record what the workspace looked
# like at the moment of judgement.

# ── the agent's own score is not the verifier's ─────────────────────────────
# The image ships run_tests.sh, and an agent that ran it wrote its OWN
# reward.txt and metrics.json into /logs/verifier against the VISIBLE corpus.
# Left in place, test.sh would overwrite some of those files and leave others,
# and the record would carry a metrics.json half written by the thing being
# measured. So the agent's phase is moved aside — kept, because what the agent
# believed about its own progress is evidence, just not the verdict.

# score_golden.py writes partial_score, pass_rate, passed, total AND per_method
# to /logs/verifier/metrics.json — and then test.sh's holdout merge REPLACES that
# file with a summary that has no per_method in it at all. The per-method
# breakdown is the most useful thing the verifier produces (it is what says
# whether an attempt got hover right and references wrong), so the first complete
# metrics.json is copied aside the moment it appears. `cp -n` means the first
# writing wins; the json.loads guard means a half-written file is not the one
# that wins.
