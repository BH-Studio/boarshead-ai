# marathon/cell.sh — ONE SWE-Marathon cell: one arm, one task, one container.
#
# Usage: marathon/cell.sh <arm> <task>          arms: codeaf-crew | codeaf-flash | pi | opencode
#
# THE SHAPE IS swe/cell.sh's, AND FOR THE SAME REASONS.
#
# The task only exists inside its own image — a Rust toolchain, a 1,007-file
# Java corpus and an encrypted golden corpus baked in by the dataset's own
# Dockerfile — so the harness has to run IN the container. tmux lives on the
# HOST and drives `docker exec -it`, which means the dataset's image is the one
# under test (nothing is derived, nothing is apt-installed into it) and the pane
# is a real TTY. The profile directory is a bind mount from the cell's own host
# directory, so the journal the settle detector polls and lib/road.py reads is
# on the host at a path the existing readers already understand.
#
# WHAT IS DIFFERENT HERE, AND WHY.
#
# 1. NOTHING FROM tests/ OR solution/ IS MOUNTED WHILE THE AGENT RUNS. On the
#    SWE track /tests is one mount with tests/judge masked, because the verifier
#    imports a library out of it. Here tests/ carries the HOLDOUT corpus, the
#    pristine scorer and the anti-cheat scanner — an agent that can read
#    tests/holdout/golden.jsonl has been handed the hidden test set. So the
#    container is created with no /tests at all, and tests/ is `docker cp`'d in
#    only after the harness is dead. Docker cannot add a bind mount to a running
#    container, and the copy is the honest equivalent: same container, same
#    filesystem, read after the agent can no longer read anything.
#
# 2. THE TIMER IS THE CONTAINER'S OWN UPTIME. environment/timer.sh reports
#    `36000 - $(ps -o etimes= -p 1)`, so `bash /app/timer.sh` is correct for free
#    as long as PID 1 was born when the task began. `--entrypoint sleep … infinity`
#    makes PID 1 the sleep this cell started, exactly as Harbor's own container
#    does, and the container is created immediately before the prompt is sent so
#    the agent's remaining budget matches the cell's remaining wall.
#
# 3. THE AGENT COMPILES WITH THE IMAGE'S TOOLCHAIN, AND THE NETWORK IS THE
#    TASK'S ALLOWLIST. Both were measured defects, and both are runner faults
#    rather than harness ones — see "The toolchain" and "The network" below.
#
# 4. /logs IS SHARED BETWEEN THE TWO PHASES. The agent's own `run_tests.sh`
#    writes /logs/verifier/reward.txt and metrics.json — a score the AGENT
#    produced against the visible corpus, which must never be mistaken for the
#    verifier's verdict. So everything the agent left in /logs is moved aside to
#    /logs/agent-phase/ before /tests/test.sh runs. It is kept, not deleted: what
#    the agent believed about its own progress is evidence.

# ── the toolchain: one rustup state, shared with the verifier ───────────────
#
# THE DEFECT THIS FIXES, MEASURED. The agent is run with `HOME=/chome` so the
# harness's dotfiles stay out of /root — but the image installs rust as root,
# into /root/.rustup and /root/.cargo, and rustup finds its store through
# $HOME/.rustup. With HOME=/chome the agent's very first `rustc --version`
# answers
#
#   error: rustup could not choose a version of rustc to run, because one wasn't
#   specified explicitly, and no default is configured.
#   help: run 'rustup default stable' …
#
# and every model does what the help text says. That install went to
# /chome/.rustup, where `tests/test.sh` — PATH=/root/.cargo/bin, HOME=/root —
# could never see it. Seed s6's Cargo.lock pinned url 2.5.8 -> idna -> icu 2.3,
# which needs rustc 1.88; it built in the cell all day and the verifier scored it
# 0.0 for a compiler it did not have.
#
# THE FIX IS TO RESTORE INHERITANCE, NOT TO FORBID THE UPGRADE. Officially the
# agent runs as root with HOME=/root, task.toml's allowlist includes
# static.rust-lang.org, and the verifier runs in the SAME container off the SAME
# /root/.rustup — so an agent that runs `rustup default stable` is making a legal
# move and the verifier inherits its compiler. That inheritance is what our split
# HOME broke. It is also close to unavoidable now: lsp-types depends on url, any
# fresh resolution today lands on url 2.5.8, and two of the six live seeds are
# already on a 1.88+ lockfile.
#
# So: RUSTUP_HOME and CARGO_HOME on the image's own paths, HOME still /chome for
# the harness's dotfiles, PATH exactly tests/test.sh's. One rustup state, shared
# by agent and verifier, precisely as officially. NOTHING IS PINNED — a pin would
# make this runner STRICTER than the benchmark and score a legitimately upgraded
# workspace 0.0, which is the same error in the other direction.
