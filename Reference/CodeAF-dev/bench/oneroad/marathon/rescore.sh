# marathon/rescore.sh — an honest, out-of-band score of a LIVE cell's workspace.
#
# Usage: rescore.sh <seed> <n>            e.g.  rescore.sh s6 3
#        ARM=codeaf-crew TASK=rust-java-lsp rescore.sh s6 3
#
# WHAT IT IS FOR. The hourly curve is written by snapshot.sh from inside the
# cell's own loop. When a cell is already running — or when its curve was taken
# with the wrong compiler, which is what happened to the seeds launched before
# the toolchain fix — a reading has to be taken from outside it. `<n>` is just
# the sequence number of the reading: it names the output directory and labels
# the row, so a series of them reads as a curve.
#
# THE TWO THINGS THAT MAKE IT HONEST.
#
# 1. THE DROPPINGS ARE STRIPPED. The workspace is copied WITHOUT target/ (build
#    output the verifier rebuilds anyway, and gigabytes of it), .git, and
#    .codeaf — the harness's own store, which the agent happens to have
#    written inside the working directory and which is no part of the work being
#    judged. Everything else travels, including the corpus and any symlink the
#    agent arranged: the scorer addresses test points as
#    file:///workspace/test-files/<rel>, so an arrangement one level above the
#    crate is part of the answer.
#
# 2. THE AGENT'S COMPILER IS ADOPTED. The agent may legally have upgraded its
#    toolchain, and the real verifier — running in the agent's own container —
#    inherits that upgrade. A rescore that used the image's 1.86.0 would report
#    0.0 for a workspace the benchmark scores properly. See toolchain.sh.
#
# It scores in a SHORT-LIVED CONTAINER OF ITS OWN, on two CPUs, so it never
# takes the running agent's four. It never touches the agent's container beyond
# reading it, and it can be run while the cell is live.
