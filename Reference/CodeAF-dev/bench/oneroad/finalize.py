"""finalize.py — rebuild a cell's record from what is on disk.

TWO JOBS, and both come from the same fact: everything a row needs is durable
evidence in the cell directory, so the row can always be rebuilt without re-
running anything.

  1. RESCUE. A cell whose driver died after the harness finished still has its
     store, its suite logs and its diff. This writes the meta.json and the judge
     bundle that the driver would have written, rather than throwing away a run
     that has already been paid for.
  2. BACKFILL. When a road column is added or corrected — `escalated` was added
     after wave 1 had landed — every earlier cell can be re-read against the new
     reader instead of being left with a blank column or, worse, re-run and
     quietly compared against rows measured on a different day.

It never re-runs a harness and never touches the work tree. wall_s is taken from
the driver's own log, because the clock is the one fact the directory cannot
recompute.

Usage: finalize.py <cell-dir> [<cell-dir> ...]
