# Replay: off-policy evaluation of mid-turn escalation questions

Generated 2026-08-25 00:23 | 240 completions | temp 0.7 | 3 samples/cell/variant/model

System prompt: **synthesized stand-in** (no `system` role is recorded in any transcript). Identical for every cell/variant/model.

Ground truth at the mark: `batch` -> SPLIT (four independent issues); `20`,`21`,`22`,`23` -> CONTINUE.

## Score table

Decision classes: SPLIT / CONTINUE / AMBIG (answered, no clear decision) / IGNORED (did not answer the checkpoint at all - emitted a tool call, or narrated the next action). `unclear` below = AMBIG + IGNORED.

| variant | model | trap-acc (20/21/22/23 -> CONTINUE) | width-recall (batch -> SPLIT) | ambig | ignored | unclear | sum |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A (current) | deepseek-v4-flash | 0.21 (5/24) | 0.50 (3/6) | 0.17 | 0.47 | 0.63 | 0.71 |
| A (current) | kimi-k3 | 0.96 (23/24) | 0.67 (4/6) | 0.00 | 0.07 | 0.07 | 1.62 |
| B (delegation test) | deepseek-v4-flash | 0.17 (4/24) | 0.17 (1/6) | 0.13 | 0.53 | 0.67 | 0.33 |
| B (delegation test) | kimi-k3 | 0.88 (21/24) | 0.17 (1/6) | 0.03 | 0.07 | 0.10 | 1.04 |
| C (dependency sketch) | deepseek-v4-flash | 0.62 (15/24) | 0.50 (3/6) | 0.00 | 0.17 | 0.17 | 1.12 |
| C (dependency sketch) | kimi-k3 | 0.58 (14/24) | 1.00 (6/6) | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 1.58 |
| D (recruitment) | deepseek-v4-flash | 0.46 (11/24) | 0.50 (3/6) | 0.10 | 0.40 | 0.50 | 0.96 |
| D (recruitment) | kimi-k3 | 0.71 (17/24) | 0.17 (1/6) | 0.00 | 0.40 | 0.40 | 0.88 |

### Combined over both models

| variant | trap-acc | width-recall | ambig | ignored | unclear | trap+width |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A (current) | 0.58 (28/48) | 0.58 (7/12) | 0.08 | 0.27 | 0.35 | 1.17 |
| B (delegation test) | 0.52 (25/48) | 0.17 (2/12) | 0.08 | 0.30 | 0.38 | 0.69 |
| C (dependency sketch) | 0.60 (29/48) | 0.75 (9/12) | 0.00 | 0.08 | 0.08 | 1.35 |
| D (recruitment) | 0.58 (28/48) | 0.33 (4/12) | 0.05 | 0.40 | 0.45 | 0.92 |

**Winner: variant C (dependency sketch)** by (trap-acc + width-recall), ambiguity as tiebreak.

### Variant C (dependency sketch)

**trap_hit** - codeaf-pre-crew-20-s1 / deepseek-v4-flash -> `CONTINUE` (single atom, no operator: (done))

> `(done)`
> 
> `done`: The validation workflow is already in place and tests pass — no remaining implementation.

**trap_miss** - codeaf-pre-crew-20-s1 / kimi-k3 -> `SPLIT` (pipe in shape: A > (B | C))

> A > (B | C)
> 
> A is confirming the existing `code-check.yml` workflow already runs pytest on PRs to `main` with all 317 tests passing (done); B is optionally making the `pull_request` event types (`opened`, `synchronize`, `reopened`) explicit in the YAML for clarity; C is noting that marking the `tests` job as a required status check must be done in the repo's GitHub branch-protection settings, not in code.

> A > (B | C | D) > E

### Variant D (recruitment)

**trap_hit** - codeaf-pre-crew-20-s1 / deepseek-v4-flash -> `CONTINUE` (nothing separable)

> NO, NOTHING SEPARABLE. The implementation is already complete as-is:
> 
> - `.github/workflows/code-check.yml` already triggers on PRs to `main`, runs `pytest`, and fails on test failures.
> - All 317 tests already pass.
> - The only remaining piece is configuring the `tests` job as a *required status check* in GitHub's branch protection rules — that's a repository admin setting (Settings → Branches → `main` → Require status checks), not a code change. It can't be done from inside this repository.

> Yes, two separable things:
> 
> **Task A**: Scan all test files in `tests/` for any mention of arithmetic, math operators (`+`, `-`, `×`, `÷`, `=`, `*`, `/`), or expressions like `2+2`, `5×3`. Report every test method/function that relates to arithmetic so we know what's expected and whether any tests already exist.

**width_hit** - codeaf-pre-crew-batch-s1 / deepseek-v4-flash -> `SPLIT` (names separable work)

> Yes, the validation workflow (Issue #20) is perfectly separable — it's a standalone YAML file in `.github/workflows/` with no code dependencies. I'll hand that off.
> 
> For the other two (arithmetic and currency), they both touch the same shared files (`spans.py`, `config.py`, `__init__.py`, `normalizer.py`) so they'd conflict if done in parallel.

**width_miss** - codeaf-pre-crew-batch-s1 / deepseek-v4-flash -> `AMBIG` (no clear marker)

> Great observations! The two extra workers can each take one fully independent piece that touches only a single file not yet modified.
> 
> - **Worker 1**: Create `.github/workflows/validation.yml` for Issue #20 (completely new file, zero overlap).

## Variant C, stricter read: only a top-level ` | ` counts as SPLIT

The spec scores any ` | ` in the sketch as SPLIT. But `A > (B | C)` means *one job first, then a fork* - which at the mark is a CONTINUE. Re-reading C that way (pipes inside parentheses ignored):

| model | trap-acc | width-recall | unclear |
|---|---|---|---|
| deepseek-v4-flash | 0.71 (17/24) | 0.17 (1/6) | 0.17 |
| kimi-k3 | 1.00 (24/24) | 0.83 (5/6) | 0.00 |

## Variant C: does the batch sketch match the four real issues?

Real issues: #20 CI validation workflow, #21 arithmetic normalization, #22 currency normalization, #23 optional CLI deps. At the round-10 mark some issues are already partly done, so a 3/4 sketch is often correct - several answers explicitly name the fourth as already finished.
