"""REPLAY-2: off-policy test of a DIGEST-based mark reader.

Live wave 1e failure: the mastermind mark reader read the RAW transcript at
rounds 10/20/40 on the four-issue batch cell (57k/65k/91k tokens) and answered
CONTINUE all three times, at $0.62. Hypothesis: raw, result-heavy context drowns
the ask. This script builds a compact DIGEST instead - the person's ask verbatim,
a ledger of tool calls with NO results, the last thing said, and the files
touched - bounds it to ~6k tokens, and asks the same sketch question.

The first line of every answer is parsed exactly as
internal/session/checkpoint.go's parseCheckpointSketch + topLevelParts do.

Usage:
  python3 replay2.py --probe        # build every digest, print token counts
  python3 replay2.py --show CELL:N  # print one digest verbatim
  python3 replay2.py                # full run (answers2.jsonl + RESULTS-2.md)
  python3 replay2.py --score-only   # re-score existing answers2.jsonl
