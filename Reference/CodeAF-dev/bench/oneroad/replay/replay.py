"""Off-policy replay evaluation of mid-turn escalation questions.

Reads recorded codeaf benchmark transcripts, truncates each at ~10 completed
tool rounds, appends ONE candidate checkpoint question as a user injection,
and asks two OpenRouter models what they would do. Scores the resulting
decision distribution (SPLIT vs CONTINUE vs AMBIG) per variant per model.

Usage:
  python3 replay.py                 # full run (writes answers.jsonl + RESULTS.md)
  python3 replay.py --probe         # one call, print reconstruction stats
  python3 replay.py --dry           # reconstruct only, print token estimates
  python3 replay.py --score-only    # re-score existing answers.jsonl
