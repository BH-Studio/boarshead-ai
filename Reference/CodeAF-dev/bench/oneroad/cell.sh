#
# THE PROTOCOL POINT (bench/oneroad/README.md): the codeaf arms are driven
# through the REAL TUI over tmux. The issue text is pasted into the composer and
# Enter is pressed, exactly as a person would, and what the chat surface decides
# to do with it IS the measurement. `codeaf do` and `chat --once` are headless
# doors that are handed the shape instead of choosing it, and using either here
# would answer a different question.
#
# pi and opencode get the same text through their own front door, which is their
# one-shot print mode. They have no task concept and no road to choose, which is
# exactly why they are the reference point.

# ── the competitor's own bill ───────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# pi and opencode print no cost, but both KEEP one — pi in its session jsonl,
# opencode in its sqlite — and lib/competitor_cost.py finds this cell's sessions
# by the cell's own work directory and prices the tokens at OpenRouter list. That
# is the comparable figure: the same arithmetic every arm's cost is now quoted
# under, rather than a self-report from one harness and a blank from the others.
#
# IT RUNS AFTER meta.json IS WRITTEN, because meta.json is what it updates, and
# BEFORE the judge bundle, which reads meta.json.
#
# IT MAY NOT FAIL THE CELL. The script also rewrites results.csv, and two things
# make that unsafe to depend on here: the file does not exist yet for the first
# cell of a grid, and cells run concurrently, so two of them rewriting it at once
# could drop a row. Neither matters — meta.json is the durable record and
# collect.py rebuilds results.csv from every meta.json at the end of the grid, so
# a lost or missing CSV row is repaired by the next collect. The `|| true` is
# therefore not papering over a failure; it is saying that this cell's evidence
# does not depend on the shared file.
