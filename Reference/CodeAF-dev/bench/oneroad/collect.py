    A codeaf cell is called finished when its store has been silent for
    SILENCE_SECONDS, so the wall the cell timed ALWAYS carries that window on the
    end — a cell that worked for 66 seconds records 246. Quoting that beside a
    peer arm's wall, which has no such window, would hand every peer a free three
    minutes. So the real end of work is derived rather than assumed: the newest
    substantive file in the session store (presence.json excluded, it is a
    heartbeat) is the last moment anything happened, and the difference between
    that and the store's oldest file is the work.

    The peer arms have no settle window and no store, so their wall IS active and
    is passed through unchanged. A DNF has no end of work to find and reports
    nothing rather than a number.
