"""judge_bundle.py — one cell's blind judge input, ready to hand to a Sonnet.

JUDGE.md's rule 2 is that the judge is BLIND: it is told the issue, the diff, the
test counts and the attempt's own report, and it is never told which harness
produced them. So this writes exactly those four sections and nothing else — no
arm name, no wall clock, no cost, no road. The harness's identity is in
meta.json beside it, where the recorder reads it and the judge does not.

Usage: judge_bundle.py <cell-dir>
Writes <cell-dir>/judge_input.md.
