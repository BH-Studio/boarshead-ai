"""road.py — the road columns, and the parallelism timeline, read from the store.

bench/oneroad/README.md's rule for the last five columns is that they come from
the run and never from the run's own account of itself. So nothing here reads a
reply: every number is taken from the v3 session folder the profile left behind —
the task checkpoint (tasks.json), the per-node journals (tasks/*.jsonl, whose
NAME carries the minute the node opened and whose entries carry their own
timestamps) and the conversation transcript (transcript.jsonl, where propose_task
and divide_work are recorded as tool calls with their arguments).

Usage:
    road.py <session-dir> [--snapshots <dir>] [--timeline <out.json>]

Prints one JSON object of the CSV columns on stdout. --timeline writes the fuller
per-worker record the parallelism autopsy wants.
