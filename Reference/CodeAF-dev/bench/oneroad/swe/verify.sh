# verify.sh — the dataset's verdict, minus the stages we cannot honestly run.
#
# It runs INSIDE the task container and is deliberately NOT `tests/test.sh`.
# test.sh has five stages and three of them are LLM judges (rubric, taste) or a
# validation agent (mini-swe-agent), all of which want ANTHROPIC/OPENAI keys we
# do not provide. Running test.sh whole would spend minutes installing litellm
# and mini-swe-agent to produce judge outputs that fail, and — worse — it would
# leave a reward file assembled from failed judges that reads like a score.
#
# So this runs exactly the stages that are DETERMINISTIC and says which it
# skipped, in a file the row records:
#
#   stage 0  capture the agent diff        — replicated from test.sh verbatim
#   setup    tests/test-setup.sh           — services and toolchain the verifiers need
#   stage 1  run_verify.py                 — the native verifiers. THE VERDICT.
#   stage 5  run_aggregate.py aggregate    — assembles reward.json from what exists
#
#   SKIPPED: stage 2 rubric judge, 2b rubric-all, 3 taste judge, 4 validation agent.
#
# A VALIDATION-PRIMARY TASK HAS NO VALID REWARD HERE and the aggregator says so
# itself: with a validation_spec.toml present and no validation_results.json, it
# refuses to fall back to verifier-only scoring (run_aggregate.py's comment C2).
# That refusal is correct and is recorded as "reward unavailable", never as 0.

# ── the verifier's own dependencies ────────────────────────────────────────
#
# THIS BLOCK IS test.sh's, AND OMITTING IT COST THE FIRST SMOKE ITS ROW. The
# reasoning that dropped it was "these are judge dependencies and we run no
# judges" — and it is wrong: /tests/ssb_lib/__init__.py imports validation_judge
# unconditionally, which imports jinja2 at module load, so `from ssb_lib.runners
# import discover_and_run_all` fails before a single NATIVE verifier runs. The
# whole stage died in two seconds with ModuleNotFoundError and the aggregator
# correctly marked the trial invalid.
#
# So the dataset's own list is installed verbatim, judge packages included. They
# are never called — nothing here runs run_judge.py — but they have to be
# IMPORTABLE, and the honest way to guarantee that is to install what the
# dataset installs rather than to guess a subset a future ssb_lib will break.
