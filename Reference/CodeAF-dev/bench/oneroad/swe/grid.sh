# swe/grid.sh — the Senior SWE-Bench wave, fired arm-fair, under a GLOBAL cap.
#
# THE CAP IS GLOBAL AND NOT THIS TRACK'S OWN. The live-issue wave is running on
# the same machine and each of its cells holds a tmux session, a codeaf process
# and a clone; each of these holds a container with 4 CPUs and 8 GB reserved on
# top. Counting only our own cells would let the two tracks add up to twice the
# machine. So capacity is measured across BOTH runners' cells and a wave waits
# for room rather than taking it.
