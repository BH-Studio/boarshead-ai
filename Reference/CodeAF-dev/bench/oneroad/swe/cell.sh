# swe/cell.sh — ONE Senior SWE-Bench cell: one arm, one task, one container.
#
# Usage: swe/cell.sh <arm> <task>
#
# THE SHAPE, AND WHY IT IS THIS SHAPE.
#
# The task's repository only exists inside its Docker image, with the toolchain
# the repo needs already built (better-auth's image carries a full pnpm build).
# So the harness has to run IN the container. Two ways to get a real TUI in
# there, and this takes the second:
#
#   a thin derived image per task with tmux apt-installed into it — seven builds,
#   seven images to keep in step with the dataset's own, and a benchmark that
#   measures a container it built rather than the one the dataset ships;
#
#   TMUX ON THE HOST, driving `docker exec -it` — no image is modified, the
#   dataset's container is the one under test, and the pane is a real TTY on a
#   real terminal exactly as wave 1's was.
#
# The second also buys the thing that makes the road columns work: the profile
# directory is a BIND MOUNT from the cell's own host directory, so the journal
# the settle detector polls and lib/road.py reads is on the host, at a path the
# existing readers already understand. Nothing about the autopsy changes.
#
# ORACLE SAFETY. solution/oracle.patch, tests/judge/ and task.toml (whose
# [metadata] carries the canonical fix IN PROSE) must never reach a harness or a
# judge. Only tests/ is mounted, at /tests, and tests/judge is masked with an
# empty read-only directory over it. The prompt is instruction.md's `## Task`
# section alone — not the file, which also carries the general instructions, and
# never task.toml.

# hides a directory from the BUILD, not from filepath.Walk.
# So the artifacts are written to $SWE_OUT (default ~/af-bench/swe) and
