"""judge_bundle_swe.py — the blind judge input for a SWE cell.

Same four sections JUDGE.md asks for, sourced from this track's own artifacts:
ISSUE is the Task section alone (issue.txt), PATCH is the dataset's own
agent.patch, TESTS is the verifier summary, REPORT is the harness's last word.

THE ORACLE NEVER APPEARS HERE. solution/oracle.patch, tests/judge/oracle.patch
and task.toml's [metadata].solution are all excluded by construction — this
reads only the cell directory, and the cell directory never contained them.
