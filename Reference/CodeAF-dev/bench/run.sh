# codeaf shape. Four values, against the same recorded pi and opencode rows:
#
#   node     one leaf, one graph. The executor measured alone, and the drift
#            control: byte for byte the invocation the recorded codeaf numbers
#            came from, so a re-run that moves says the harness moved.
#   do       `codeaf do "<issue text>"` with no graph written for it. The
#            shipping claim: the compiler decides how the work is shaped and
#            that shape is what gets measured. It used to be called `select`,
#            for the worker it also chose; there is one worker now, so what it
#            still decides is the shape and nothing else.
#   pipeline plan the graph first, then run it. The parallel shape, and what the
#            PR-review comparison used.
#   chat     `codeaf chat --once` — the chat surface's brain, one turn, nobody
#            watching. NOT a fourth way to run an errand: it compiles no graph,
#            so there is no delivery gate, no replan and no done.json. It is
