# Swarm-mode benchmark: A/B across a task corpus, four arms.
#
# One cell = one task × one arm. Every cell runs `codeaf do` in a fresh
# directory with a private durable store, then a category verdict script
# grades the artifacts — never the run's self-report. The corpus and the
# doctrine live in README.md; this file is only the protocol.
#
# Read bench/README.md for the cost doctrine (self-reported usage only).
# This suite inherits it: the cost column comes from the journal's usage
# table, summed per cell, and from nothing else.
#
# Arms (named; CODEAF_MECHANISM selects the inhibition/quorum extension,
# gated behind CODEAF_SWARM=1):
#   baseline    CODEAF_SWARM=0, CODEAF_MECHANISM=baseline
#               refusal-first pipeline — no cooperative decomposition.
#   swarm       CODEAF_SWARM=1, CODEAF_MECHANISM=baseline
#               cooperative claim-time decomposition (the original ON arm).
#   inhibition  CODEAF_SWARM=1, CODEAF_MECHANISM=inhibition
#               swarm + explicit scope ownership injected into split parts.
#   quorum      CODEAF_SWARM=1, CODEAF_MECHANISM=quorum
#               swarm + two validators gate the commit, one revision round.

Usage: bench/swarm/run.sh [--help]   (env: TIER, JOBS, MODEL, TASKS, BENCH_CLEAN)

Runs the swarm benchmark corpus, one cell per task × arm × seed, and appends
one CSV row per cell to results/results.csv.

Arms (the factor this suite varies):
  baseline    CODEAF_SWARM=0, CODEAF_MECHANISM=baseline   (refusal-first)
  swarm       CODEAF_SWARM=1, CODEAF_MECHANISM=baseline   (cooperative decomposition)
  inhibition  CODEAF_SWARM=1, CODEAF_MECHANISM=inhibition  (scope ownership in splits)
  quorum      CODEAF_SWARM=1, CODEAF_MECHANISM=quorum      (validators gate commit)

All arms of one task fire in the same wave (pair-fair → now arm-fair) so a
provider slowdown lands on every arm of the comparison together and cancels
out of the delta. JOBS bounds the wave; JOBS=1 is the timing-clean mode.

Tiers (power, not coverage):
  smoke     one seed per non-L task (wiring check)
  standard  full corpus, n=3
  full      adds the L task, n=5

tasks.txt rows may carry an optional 6th pipe-field: a comma-separated arm
list to run for that task. `all` (the default, also the value when the field
is absent) means baseline,swarm,inhibition,quorum,splitgate.
