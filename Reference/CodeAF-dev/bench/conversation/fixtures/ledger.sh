# ledger.sh — the data workload's fixture: a small CSV with arithmetic in it.
#
# Deterministic and offline. The point of a data cell is that the right answer
# is a NUMBER, computed from the same bytes the harness was given, so the check
# is arithmetic rather than judgement — and so a fluent, confident, wrong answer
# fails. The expected values are computed here, from the fixture, and written
# beside it: a benchmark whose answer key is typed by hand drifts away from its
# own fixture the first time the fixture is edited.

# fixture_ledger <workspace> <judge-dir>. The CSV goes where the model can read
# it; the answer key goes where it cannot.
