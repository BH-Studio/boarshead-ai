# slowwork.sh — the interactive scenarios' fixture: work that takes long enough
# to be interrupted, and that says out loud when it started and when it ended.
#
# The phase markers are the point. "The screen looked busy" only proves a model
# request was in flight, which can be true before any work has begun; and a
# transcript that ends with the right answer proves nothing about WHEN it was
# given. So the slow job writes two timestamps into a directory of its own, by
# absolute path, and the driver reads them:
#
#   <phases>/build-started    written the moment the job begins
#   <phases>/build-finished   written when it is done
#
# The path is baked into the script when the fixture is generated, so the
# markers land in the same place even if the agent copies the script elsewhere
# or runs it from another directory. Timestamps are epoch seconds with
# fractions, from one clock on one machine, so the driver can order them
# against its own samples.
