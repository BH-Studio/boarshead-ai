"""Validate a real-issue manifest, and preflight it against the repository it names.

A real-issue cell is one closed bug, its frozen base commit, and the test the fix
brought with it — held out, so the workspace the harness sees never contains it.
Everything that runs a cell already exists in `bench/conversation` and, for
container corpora, in `bench/deepswe`; this file is only the part that says
whether a candidate is honest enough to run.

    manifest.py validate candidates/*.json
    manifest.py preflight candidates/528-reopened-jobs.json --repo /path/to/checkout

`validate` is offline, needs no git and calls nothing: it is what the unit tests
run. `preflight` adds the checks that need the object store.

**The lexical checks here are lint, not proof of isolation.** They catch the
disclosures we have actually seen — a fenced block of the implementation
language, a test function name, a fix sha, a pull-request pointer, a diff, a
`## The fix` heading. They cannot prove a prose paragraph does not describe the
repair. Isolation comes from curating the prompt and recording what was dropped;
the lint is what stops the obvious regression.

Scope, v1: `task_kind: bug-existing-api` — a behavioural defect whose held-out
test drives an API that already exists at the base commit. A feature task may
legitimately need a public API that does not exist at base and its test cannot
build there; that is a different kind and this file does not accept it yet.
