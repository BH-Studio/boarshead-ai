"""A loopback forwarding guard: it refuses a non-allowlisted model, and it is
the run's own meter for what was actually billed.

Why it exists. `--one-model` and `--smol/--slow/--plan` are configuration, not
enforcement: a role, a fallback chain, a reused profile setting or a generated
task can still name another model. So the harness never gets the real key. The
guard holds it, the harness gets a sentinel and a loopback base URL, and two
things become true rather than hoped for: a call naming a model off the
allowlist is refused before any socket upstream is opened, and a call that goes
around the guard can buy nothing.

Why it also meters. A harness's self-reported cost is its own arithmetic over
its own price table, and a custom provider config can put zeroes in that table —
which is exactly how a paid pilot run reported $0.00. What the provider says it
charged is upstream's `usage`, and this is the only place that sees it for every
call including the auxiliary ones.

How the meter cannot quietly under-count. Every request that is ADMITTED gets a
`phase: "admitted"` row with a request id before a socket upstream is opened,
and a `phase: "settled"` row when it ends — priced, or explicitly unknown. A
call that is billed and then lost (the client hangs up mid-stream, the upstream
fails after generating, this process is killed) leaves an admission nothing
closed, and the reader turns that into an unknown cost for the whole cell rather
than a total that silently omits it.

  guard.py --allow <id> [--allow <id>] --audit <path> --usage <path>
           --sentinel <token> --scope <name>

It prints `PORT <n>` when listening. The real key comes from GUARD_UPSTREAM_KEY
in its own environment and is never logged.
