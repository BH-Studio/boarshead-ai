"""Read one cell's receipts and normalise them into one shape.

A receipt is what the harness itself recorded about the call it made: which
model was billed, how many tokens went each way, what it cost. Three families
of receipt exist among the arms this suite runs, and this module is the only
place that knows the difference between them.

    pi-events        pi and omp stream JSON Lines events on stdout under
                     `--mode json`; assistant messages carry `model` and a
                     `usage` block with a `cost` breakdown.
    codeaf-home      codeaf writes `v3/usage.jsonl` (one row per call, with the
                     role that made it) and `logs/calls.jsonl` (one row per
                     wire call, with time-to-first-token) under CODEAF_HOME.
    opencode-events  opencode streams events under `--format json`; the
                     `step_finish` part carries tokens and cost — and no model.

TWO RULES HOLD IN ALL THREE READERS.

**Unknown stays unknown.** A harness that reported no usage gets `cost_usd:
null` and `cost_source: "none"`, never `0`. Zero is a measurement and null is
the absence of one, and a Pareto plot that reads an absence as a zero puts the
harness that reports nothing on the frontier.

**Every model that was billed is named, including the auxiliary ones.** A
title call, a reflex, a summariser or a fallback is a call somebody paid for
and a call the open-model law applies to. `models` is every distinct id seen;
`aux_models` is the subset that a role other than the turn itself made.

    that table, which is how a paid pilot reported $0.00. Tokens without a cost
    stay tokens: no price is invented from them here.

    The guard opens a row when it ADMITS a request and closes one when the
    request ends, and both carry the same request id. The only sound way to
    know every admitted call was accounted for is to pair them id by id:
    counting admissions against settlements can be fooled by a torn ledger
    where one settlement is written twice and another is missing, and the
    counts agree while a billed call went unrecorded. So: an admission with no
    settlement, a settlement naming an admission that never was, a repeated
    id on either side, or a cost that is not a finite non-negative number —
    any of these makes the whole cell's cost unknown rather than part-counted.

    One shape is still read without ids: the rows the guard wrote before it
    recorded admissions have no phase and no request id, and evidence from
