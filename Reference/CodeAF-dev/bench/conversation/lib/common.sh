#
# Two things live here and nothing else: the handful of shell facts that differ
# between a Mac and a Linux box, and the small helpers that turn a value into a
# line of evidence. Everything harness-specific is in adapters.sh; everything
# about which models may be called is in allowlist.sh.
#
# Portability is not a nicety here. The rig this suite grew out of
# (bench/canary/lib/chat.sh) reads a file's modification time with `stat -c %Y`,
# which is GNU-only: on macOS that call fails, the fallback puts "now" in the
# variable, and the quiet-for-N-seconds witness therefore never fires. A witness
# that silently never fires is worse than no witness, so every OS-dependent call
# in this suite goes through a function below that is written for both.

# conv_root is this suite's directory; CONV_REPO_ROOT is the checkout it sits in.
