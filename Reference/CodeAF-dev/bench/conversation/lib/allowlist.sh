# allowlist.sh — the open-model policy: which models this suite may cause calls
# to, and how that is checked.
#
# Three gates, because no single one is sufficient:
#
#   environment  a harness inherits OPENROUTER_API_KEY and no other credential
#                (common.sh: CONV_CARRIED), so it cannot reach a provider this
#                run did not intend.
#   before       the arm is handed the exact pinned id, its catalog is asked
#                whether that id exists, and an arm that cannot pin its
#                auxiliary roles to the same model is skipped rather than run
#                (adapters.sh: arm_pin_check, arm_role_pin).
#   after        every model id in the cell's own receipts is checked against
#                the list. This catches what a flag cannot: a role, a title
#                call or a fallback that resolved elsewhere.
#
# Entries are exact catalog ids. No wildcards and no family names: matching
# `deepseek-v4-flash` as a substring would accept its dated siblings too.

# CONV_MODEL is the pin every arm is handed, in that arm's spelling
# (adapters.sh: arm_model_arg). The default is DeepSeek V4 Flash at a dated id;
# a floating alias is free to move under a benchmark.

# CONV_ALLOWLIST is every id this run may legitimately have billed. When it is
# not set explicitly it follows CONV_MODEL, including after --model moves the
# pin: an allowlist left pointing at the previous default would permit exactly
# the model the caller just chose to stop using.
