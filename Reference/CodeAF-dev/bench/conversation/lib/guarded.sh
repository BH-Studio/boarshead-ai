# guarded.sh — start the forwarding guard, and wire an arm through it.
#
# The guard (lib/guard.py) holds the real key; a harness gets a sentinel and a
# base URL on loopback. An arm is live-runnable here only if every call it makes
# can be pointed at that base URL through a mechanism the CLI actually
# documents or implements. An arm that cannot is unsupported, with the reason
# recorded — not run in the hope that its flags hold.

# ONE GUARD PER CELL. The guard is also the run's meter, and a meter shared
# between cells cannot say which cell a late call belonged to: a session host
# that keeps working after a cell ends would smear its spend onto the next one.
# A cell's own guard closes with the cell, so a straggler reaches a closed port
# and is visible as a failure rather than counted as somebody else's cost.
