#!/usr/bin/env bash
# door_tmux.sh — the interactive door: a real terminal, real keystrokes.
#
# This is the only door in this suite that may be described as conversation. A
# `--print` invocation is one message in and one reply out; it cannot be
# interrupted, cannot be revised halfway, and cannot be typed at while it works.
# Those are the three things people actually do, so they are measured here or
# not claimed at all.
#
# The driver is deliberately dumb about what a harness means and precise about
# what it sees. It knows two regexes per arm (adapters.sh): one that says a
# composer is up, and one that says something is in flight. Everything else is
# timing. An arm without calibrated regexes has no interactive door here and its
# cells are recorded `unsupported` — never run through the print door instead,
# because a print row wearing an interactive label is the exact lie this suite
# is built to avoid.
#
# THE TURN PLAN IS THE SCENARIO'S SCRIPT. One line per message:
#
#   ready<TAB>text    send once the composer is up (the opening message)
#   midwork<TAB>text  send while the SCENARIO'S OWN WORK is running — after its
#                     work-start marker appears and before its work-done marker
#                     does. This is the followup and steering case, and the
#                     window is the scenario's, not the screen's: a spinner only
#                     says a model request is in flight, which can be true
#                     before any work has begun. If the window never opens, or
#                     closes before the message could be sent, the cell records
#                     `no-midwork-window` and FAILS — the thing under test did
#                     not happen, so there is nothing to pass.
#   busy<TAB>text     send when the screen looks busy. A weaker witness, kept
#                     for scenarios with no work of their own to mark, and
#                     labelled as such in door.json.
#   idle<TAB>text     send after the harness has settled (the next-turn case)
#
# When the composer never appears, `ended` tells the two cases apart:
# `crash` (the pane died), `noframe` (nothing was ever drawn) and `noready`
# (a screen was drawn that these markers do not match — a calibration gap in
# this suite, recorded as unsupported rather than as a harness failure).
#
# Evidence written to <out>:
#   screen.txt        the final pane
#   scrollback.txt    the whole conversation, which is what assertions read
#   frames.log        one status line per poll, and a full frame per turn
#   door.json         what the driver observed, in numbers
