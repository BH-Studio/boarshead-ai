# verdict.sh — the vocabulary a cell speaks about its own outcome.
#
# The distinction bench/e2e/lib/assert.sh draws is kept here, because it is the
# whole discipline: a cell PASSES or FAILS the things it guards, and RECORDS the
# things it merely wants written down. Anything with a legitimate range — what a
# run cost, how many calls it took, which shape the work took — is recorded, so
# that a change in it is visible without being a failure. A battery that fails on
# a healthy run stops being read, and a battery nobody reads guards nothing.
#
# What this file adds over the e2e one is the outcomes that are neither pass nor
# fail, and that a conversation suite cannot do without:
#
#   unsupported  the arm has no door for this scenario that this suite can
#                honestly drive. Nothing ran. It is excluded from every claim
#                and it is NOT a pass.
#   skipped      something outside the harness stopped the cell — no binary, no
#                key, a model that could not be pinned. The reason travels with
#                the row.
#   mismatch     the cell ran, but a setting could not be matched across arms
#                (an effort rung one arm does not have). The numbers are real
#                and are excluded from comparison, because they were not
#                measured under the same conditions as the arms beside them.
#
# NO OUTCOME EXCEPT `pass` IS EVER COUNTED AS ONE. The summary prints each of
# them separately and the runner's exit code reflects failures only, which is
# what makes "skipped" impossible to read as "passed".
