# tui-fake — a terminal program that behaves like a chat TUI, so the interactive
# door can be tested without a model.
#
# It draws the markers the real pi TUI draws, so the driver is exercised against
# the SAME regexes it uses in production. What it does with a message typed
# while work is running is the point, and FAKE_TUI_MODE chooses:
#
#   ok          answers the followup WHILE the build runs, and lets the build
#               finish. This is the behaviour the cell is meant to pass.
#   blocking    reads nothing until the build has finished, then answers
#               correctly and reports the build. A transcript-only check calls
#               this a pass; it is the false green root found, and this cell
#               must FAIL it.
#   neverbusy   answers instantly and never runs the build at all, so no
#               mid-work window ever exists — unexercised, which is a failure
#               and not a success.
#   deaf        runs the build and ignores anything typed during it.
#   smudged     answers with the right word carrying an extra leading letter
#               ("RRABANNIC"), which a live omp pane really produced. A
#               substring match calls it correct; the cell must not.
#   noready     draws a screen the driver's ready marker does not match, and
#               stays alive. This is a calibration gap in the rig, not a crash.
