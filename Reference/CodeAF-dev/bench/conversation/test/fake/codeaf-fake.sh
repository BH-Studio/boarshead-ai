# codeaf-fake — a stand-in for `codeaf chat --once`, so the other half of the
# receipt reader is tested too.
#
# codeaf does not stream its usage to stdout: the reply goes to stdout and the
# accounting goes into the home. So this fake writes the two files the reader
# actually opens — v3/usage.jsonl and a transcript with a non-aux `usage` seal —
# and the modes are the same failures as pi-fake's:
#
#   ok           reply, one turn call and one auxiliary call, both on the pin
#   exit3        the same, with a non-zero exit
#   badoutput    a wrong answer
#   hang         never finishes
#   nocost       a reply and NO usage rows: cost unknown, not zero
#   wrongmodel   the auxiliary call is billed to a model off the allowlist,
#                which is the failure --one-model exists to prevent and the one
#                a flag alone can never rule out
