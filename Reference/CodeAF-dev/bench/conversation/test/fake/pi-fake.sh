# pi-fake — a stand-in for the pi/omp print door, so the rig can be tested
# without a model.
#
# It speaks the parts of the real interface this suite actually uses: a version
# string, an exact-match model catalog, and the JSON Lines event stream that
# `--mode json` produces (verified against pi 0.84.2 and omp 18.1.2). What it
# says is controlled by FAKE_MODE, and each mode is a failure the rig has to
# catch rather than a feature:
#
#   ok           a correct answer, correct model, real usage
#   exit3        the same correct answer, and a non-zero exit code. A rig that
#                reads the reply and forgets the exit code passes this and
#                should not.
#   badoutput    a fluent, confident, wrong answer
#   hang         never finishes — the cap has to stop it
#   nocost       a correct answer with no usage block at all: cost is unknown,
#                which is not the same as zero
#   wrongmodel   a correct answer billed to a model outside the allowlist
#   zeroprice    real tokens and a self-reported cost of zero, which is a price
#                table of zeroes rather than a free call
#
# Three modes edit files instead of talking, for the coding cells. They are
# stand-ins for three different outcomes that a transcript cannot tell apart:
#
#   repair       the reference repair, copied in from outside the workspace: the
#                cell must PASS
#   cheat        the same repair except that one module answers the visible
#                tests from a table: the workspace's own suite goes green and
#                the external judge must still FAIL the cell
#   tamper       the reference repair AND an edited test file: behaviour is
#                right and the question was changed, which must FAIL
#
# Running it leaves FAKE_MARKER behind, which is how the dry-run test proves
# that composing an invocation did not execute one.
