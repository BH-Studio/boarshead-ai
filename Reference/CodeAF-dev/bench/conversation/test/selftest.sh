# WHAT THIS IS FOR. A benchmark harness fails quietly. A flag that moved between
# versions, an exit code nobody read, a cost parser that saw no usage and wrote
# zero — each of those produces a full CSV of plausible rows, and none of them
# announces itself. So every one of those failures is staged here against fake
# binaries whose behaviour is known, and the rig has to catch it. If it does
# not, this file fails and says which lie got through.
#
# Nothing here calls a model, spends anything, or reaches the network. It is
# meant to be run before and after every change to this suite:
#
#   bench/conversation/test/selftest.sh
#
# Cases, and the lie each one stages:
#
#   dry-run        composing an invocation must not execute one
#   ok             a healthy cell passes, and its cost is what one message cost
#                  and not three times it (all three arms repeat the message)
#   exit3          a non-zero exit with a perfect reply is a FAILURE
#   badoutput      a fluent wrong answer is a FAILURE
#   hang           a harness that never returns is a TIMEOUT, never a pass
#   nocost         no usage reported is cost UNKNOWN, never 0.00
#   wrongmodel     a model off the allowlist FAILS, print door and aux role both
#   nopin          an arm whose catalog cannot pin the id is SKIPPED, not run
#   unsupported    a scenario an arm has no door for is UNSUPPORTED, not passed
#   interactive    the tmux door delivers a followup typed while work is running
#                  AND the answer is seen before the work's own finish marker
#   blocking       the counterexample: a harness that queues the followup,
#                  finishes the work, then answers correctly is a FAILURE. Its
#                  final transcript is indistinguishable from a pass, which is
#                  why the cell judges timestamps and not text
#   neverbusy      no window of work to steer is a FAILURE, not a pass
#   deaf           a followup that is ignored is a FAILURE
#   smudged        a near miss is a miss: RRABANNIC is not RABANNIC
#   noready        a screen this rig cannot read is UNSUPPORTED (its own
#                  calibration gap), never a crash blamed on the harness
#   repair         four independent defects, all four repaired: a PASS, and the
#                  verdict comes from the judge beside the cell
#   cheat          the visible suite made green by a table of answers to it:
