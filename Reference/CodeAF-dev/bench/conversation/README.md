# Conversation battery

Cross-harness comparison of codeaf against omp, pi and opencode on ordinary
work **and** on conversation — the parts of using a coding agent that a
`--print` invocation cannot reach.

`run.sh` runs it, `summary.sh` reads it, `test/selftest.sh` checks the rig
itself without spending anything. This file says what each number means and
which ones it is honest to quote.

**It spends real money and is on demand.** Nothing in `make check` reaches it.
The deterministic tests under `test/` are the part that is safe to run any time:
they use fake binaries, call no model, and touch no network.

## The two doors, which are never mixed

| door | what it is | what it can show |
|---|---|---|
| `print` | one message in, one reply out (`codeaf chat --once`, `omp -p`, `pi -p`, `opencode run`) | quality, cost and wall clock on a fixed task |
| `interactive` | the real TUI in a tmux pane: bracketed paste, Enter, and a screen that is watched | everything above, plus what happens when a person types **while work is running** |

A print row is never labelled interactive. An arm with no interactive door this
suite can drive is recorded `unsupported` — not quietly run through the print
door instead, which is the one substitution that would make the whole table a
lie.

An arm has an interactive door here only if this suite can tell from the screen
alone when it is working and when it is not. Those markers, and where each came
from, are in `lib/adapters.sh`:

| arm | interactive door | markers from |
|---|---|---|
| codeaf | yes | `internal/tui3/render.go` (`stateWord`, `waitingWord`) — the renderer itself, checked against a live pane |
| pi | yes | live pane capture on pi 0.84.2 in this lane; the provider segment is derived from the provider in use, not hardcoded |
| omp | yes | live pane capture on omp 18.1.2 in this lane |
| opencode | **no** | no calibrated markers — its interactive cells are `unsupported` |

## Open models only

Every call this suite causes goes to the pinned open model. The default pin is
`deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731`, an exact catalog id rather than a floating
alias. It is configurable (`--model`, `--allowlist`), and the protocol assumes
no particular id — but the shape is fixed: exact ids, no wildcards, no family
names, and `:batch`-style variants count as different entries because they are
a different queue with a different price and latency.

### Prevention, and separately, detection

These are not the same thing and the suite does not treat them as such.

**Prevention (before the call).** A live run puts `lib/guard.py` on loopback
between the harness and OpenRouter. The guard holds the real key; each harness
gets a sentinel and a base URL pointing at the guard. It reads **every** model id
a request could route to — the `model` field and each entry of OpenRouter's
`models` fallback array, since a request naming an allowlisted model with a
commercial fallback bills the fallback the moment the first is unavailable — and
if any of them is off the allowlist it answers 403 **without opening a socket
upstream**. It forwards only the paths this suite needs, so it is not a general
proxy to the provider. Two consequences matter:

- a model off the allowlist cannot be reached, whoever asked for it — a role, a
  fallback, a reused setting, or a task the model itself generated;
- a call that goes around the guard carries only the sentinel, so it cannot buy
  anything from anybody.

The upstream is fixed in the source. It can be moved only under `GUARD_TEST=1`,
which is how the deterministic test proves a refusal never reaches an upstream:
a stand-in upstream records everything it receives, and stays empty.

An arm is live-runnable only if every call it makes can be pointed at the guard
through a mechanism that CLI actually implements:

| arm | how it is routed | source of that knowledge |
|---|---|---|
| codeaf | `CODEAF_BASE_URL` | `internal/config/config.go` in this repository |
| pi | a `guard` provider in `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/models.json` | `core/model-runtime.js` loads it from the agent dir |
| omp | a `guard` provider in the run's own `<profile>/agent/models.yml`, then **verified** by asking omp's catalog whether it loaded | omp disables custom providers wholesale on a validation failure, so writing the file is not evidence it took effect |
| opencode | not routed | no custom-provider mechanism verified for it — unsupported for live runs |

`--unguarded` exists only so the deterministic tests can drive fake binaries
that talk to nobody. It refuses to run unless the caller sets
`CONV_FAKE_HARNESS=1`, and it is not a way to run a real harness.

**Configuration is not prevention.** `--one-model` on codeaf and
`--smol/--slow/--plan` on omp are still passed, and the role-pin state is still
recorded on every row — but they are settings, not guarantees. omp alone also
carries `providers.tinyModel`, `memoryModel`, `autoThinkingModel` and
`unexpectedStopModel`; a reused profile can hold settings this run never wrote;
and a generated task can name a model. That is why the guard exists and why the
row says `role_pin: unverified` rather than pretending otherwise.

**Detection (after the call).** Every model id in the cell's own receipts is
checked against the allowlist, and a cell that billed one outside it fails.
This is the backstop, not the barrier: by the time it fires, the call has
happened. It is kept because it sees what a request body cannot — which model
the provider says it actually billed.

**Environment.** A harness process inherits `PATH`, `HOME`, `TERM`, `LANG`,
`TMPDIR` and an `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` set to the sentinel — never the real key,
and never another provider's. A carried variable that a later assignment
replaces is dropped rather than emitted and overridden: `env -i K=real
K=sentinel` gives the process the sentinel, but leaves the real value on a
command line that `ps` can read. `CONV_PASS_ENV` names anything extra to carry, so
what got through is visible in the cell's `config.txt`.

**The key.** The guard needs a live `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in the shell that
starts the run, and checks it against the upstream's `/key` endpoint before any
cell runs (no model call, no spend). This suite deliberately does **not** read
credentials out of a CLI's own store: whose key pays for a benchmark stays an
explicit decision. A stale key therefore stops the run with one message rather
than producing a grid of cells that billed nothing.

**Pinning, per arm.** The arm is also handed the exact id and its catalog is
asked whether that id exists, in the state root the cell will use — they answer
differently: on the machine this was built on, pi's default profile lists no
openrouter models at all while a fresh `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` does. The query
pattern is loose and the match is exact (provider **and** id for pi, the full
selector for omp). codeaf has no offline catalog query, so its pin rests on the
guard in front and the receipts behind.

## Cost, and what unknown means

**Measured at the guard first.** A harness's cost is its own arithmetic over its
own price table, and a custom provider config — the very thing this suite writes
to route an arm through the guard — can carry a zero price table. That is not a
hypothetical: in the first live pilot pi reported `$0.0` for a call that billed
real tokens, because its `models.json` entry priced them at zero
(`notes/pilot-01.md`). So the guard asks the provider to account for every call
it forwards (`usage: {include: true}`) and writes what came back to the cell's
own `guard-usage.jsonl`. One guard per cell means the attribution is
unambiguous: those rows are that cell's calls and no others.

| source | `cost_source` | when |
|---|---|---|
| the provider, through the guard | `guard-upstream` | any guarded run — includes auxiliary calls, and is the same measurement for every arm |
| the harness's own receipts | `self-reported` | unguarded runs, and guarded ones where upstream returned no usage block |
| nothing | `none` | neither had a figure — recorded `null`, never `0` |

A self-reported `$0` alongside a non-zero token count is treated as an **absence,
not a price**: it is a zero price table, not a free call, and the cell comes back
cost-unknown and not comparable.

**Every admitted call is accounted for, or the cell's cost is unknown.** The
guard books a request when it *admits* it — before a socket upstream is opened —
and closes that row when the request ends, priced or explicitly unpriced. A call
can be billed and still produce no usage block: the client hangs up mid-stream,
the upstream fails after generating, the guard is killed with a call in flight.
Totalling only the calls that finished would report a confident number that is
smaller than what was spent, so any admission the ledger cannot close makes the
whole cell cost-unknown — and that outranks the harness's own figure, which
covers only the calls it knows about.

Receipts are still read for every cell, because they name the billed model and
the guard's audit names what was asked for:

| arm | receipt | names the billed model? |
|---|---|---|
| codeaf | `CODEAF_HOME/v3/usage.jsonl`, one row per call including auxiliary roles | yes |
| pi, omp | the JSON Lines events on stdout under `--mode json` | yes |
| opencode | `step_finish` events under `--format json` | **no** |

A harness that reported no usage gets `cost_usd: null` and
`cost_source: "none"` — never `0`. Zero is a measurement; null is the absence of
one, and a frontier that reads an absence as a zero puts the quietest harness on
top. Cells without a cost remain in the attempt/success denominator, but cost comparisons are withheld. Cells whose billed model cannot be named are excluded with their reason attached.

An all-zero usage block is also an absence, not a zero: a refused or failed
call still emits one, and recording it as a $0 run would put a harness that
never reached the provider at the cheap end of the frontier. A print-door cell
that produced no reply at all fails on that alone.

Known gap: through the interactive door, pi and omp stream nothing to stdout, so
their receipts are read opportunistically from the session files in their
session directory. That schema has not been verified here; when it does not
parse, the cell comes back `cost unknown` and not-comparable rather than zero.

## The ambient machine

A harness that loads the operator's skills, extensions and MCP servers is not
running the task it was given: it is running that task plus whatever is
installed on that machine — extra tools, a longer system prompt, extra latency,
and a different set on every box. A live pane in this lane showed omp mounting
MCP tools and failing one of them out of `~/.claude.json`, and pi listing
thirty-odd skills out of `~/.agents/skills`.

Only documented flags and settings are used, and what a CLI does not offer is reported rather
than worked around — a benchmark that edits somebody's dotfiles to look fair has
stopped measuring the thing people run.

| arm | turned off | still loaded |
|---|---|---|
| omp 18.1.2 | `--no-skills --no-extensions --no-rules` | third-party discovery disabled in the owned profile through `disabledProviders`; native profile starts empty |
| pi 0.84.2 | `--no-skills --no-extensions` | — |
| codeaf | nothing needed: `CODEAF_HOME` moves the whole state root, so a cell starts with no ambient skills or extensions | — |

Every row records what was turned off and what was not (`ambient`), because it
is a real difference between the arms and not a footnote.

## Effort

Asked of every arm as one rung (`--effort`, default `low` — the only rung
codeaf, omp and pi all have; pi 0.84.2 has no `medium`). An arm without the rung
runs and is marked **not comparable**, with the mismatch on the row. Nothing is
silently moved to a neighbouring rung: a row that ran a rung above the others is
the most flattering possible lie about cost.

opencode's `--variant` is provider-specific and enumerates nothing, so its
effort is recorded as `unverified` and its rows are not comparable on that
basis.

## The scenarios

| scenario | workload | door | what it checks |
|---|---|---|---|
| `data-tally` | data | print | exact arithmetic over a handed CSV, against an answer key computed from the same file |
| `research-brief` | research | print | facts joined across four notes, one of which is superseded and contradicts the current one |
| `writing-memo` | writing | print | a deliverable on disk under countable constraints: word ceiling, three required facts, one banned word, a required closing line |
| `code-fix` | coding | print | a real boundary bug in a Go module: the module's own suite is the judge, and the test file is checksummed so "made the tests agree" fails |
| `followup-while-working` | conversation | interactive | a second question typed **while** a slow job runs: it must be answered, and the job must still finish |
| `revision-midwork` | conversation | interactive | the deliverable's shape is changed mid-flight: the revised file must exist, correct, and the superseded one must be gone |
| `work-result-recalled` | conversation | interactive, codeaf only | work is done, and afterwards the person **asks** what it produced: the number on the screen must be the number really in the file |

Fixtures are deterministic and offline (`fixtures/`). The interactive ones use a
script that sleeps, so the busy window costs a sleep rather than tokens.

`work-result-recalled` runs on codeaf alone because it is codeaf's terminal
being examined; on any other arm it is recorded `unsupported`, and no claim is
made about what those arms can hand off. **It asserts nothing about shape** —
not how many agents ran, not whether a task was spawned, not that a checkpoint
existed. A build that answers in one turn with no task at all passes it, and
should: the person asked for a result, not an org chart.

It is named for what it checks. **The person has to ask**, so it is a recall
check and not a delivery one: a session that finishes work and says nothing
until prompted passes it. Whether a result arrives on its own is a different
question, tested live against the product's own task surface, and it is not in
this suite.

### `multi-defect-pipeline`, which is not in the battery

One more coding scenario exists and is **not** run by default. Nothing above
changes: `run.sh` with no `--scenarios` runs the same seven cells it always did,
and `campaign.py plan` freezes the same six calibration slices. This one is
asked for by name:

```sh
bench/conversation/run.sh --scenarios multi-defect-pipeline --arms codeaf,pi,omp
bench/conversation/campaign.py plan /tmp/multi.json --id multi --scenarios multi-defect-pipeline
```

It exists because the battery's coding cell is one boundary bug in one file, and
the slow-work cells buy their busy window with a `sleep`. Neither is a piece of
work with separable parts. This one is: a small Python project — standard
library only, no dependencies, nothing downloaded — with **four independent
defects, one in each of four modules**, and a command-line pipeline that joins
them.

| module | the defect | how it shows |
|---|---|---|
| `parsing.py` | commas split by hand instead of read as CSV | a quoted site name with a comma in it, and a leading byte order mark |
| `validation.py` | a repeated identifier is only noticed on the very next record | the same `entry_id` used again four lines later |
| `aggregate.py` | an ISO week number pasted onto the calendar year | Monday 2024-12-30 is in `2025-W01`, and 2027-01-01 is in `2026-W53` |
| `report.py` | equal totals left in the order they were built | the same records in another order render differently |

They are independent — the fixture's own tests assert that repairing one repairs
one — and the pipeline's output is right only when all four are. The workspace
carries the failing suite and `SPEC.md`, which is the contract.

**The judge is black-box and it is a parent process.** `judge/judge_dutylog.py`
is copied to the cell's judge directory and runs the repaired project's own
command line as a child, on 29 cases of input the workspace never contained —
different dates and sites, minutes at exactly 1 and exactly 1440, an ISO year
that is not the calendar year, an unpadded timestamp, ties, and the whole
pipeline. It reads stdout, stderr and the exit status, and nothing else: not the
project's source text, and not its functions.

That last part is not a preference. An earlier version imported the candidate's
modules and called them, and a root review showed what that costs: a
`dutylog/__init__.py` that replaced the judge's own case list with no-ops
returned `cases: 34, failed: 0, passed: true` with the judge's checksum intact.
The parent must not import the candidate. Both counterexamples are now tests —
that one, and a module that answers the visible tests out of a lookup table
(`test/fake/dutylog-cheat`) — as is the property they protect: a rewrite that
shares no line with the reference repair passes (`test/fake/dutylog-alt`).

Judging each module through the command line is less coverage than calling its
functions was. A module's internal contract is checked only as far as the CLI
reveals it, on inputs chosen so that exactly one defect can change the answer;
the workspace's own unittest suite still describes the modules directly, as
developer guidance rather than as the mark.

**Everything is bounded.** Each child runs in its own process group with a
deadline and is killed by group, so a CLI that spawns something does not leave
it behind; the whole judging run has a budget, and the scenario wraps the judge
in `timeout -k`. A project that sleeps on import costs the cell its judging cap
and a recorded failure. Before the review it cost the cell nothing and the run
everything: the runner's cap covers the harness, not the checks that follow it.

Each module is one assertion and the pipeline is another, so a three-of-four
repair says which one is missing. `tests/` and `SPEC.md` are checksummed before
the run and the judge is checksummed before and after it. A changed instrument
is **not used**: a judge whose checksum moved is reported and not executed, and
a guard manifest whose checksum moved verifies nothing. A file *added* under
`tests/` is recorded and is not a failure.

**It asserts nothing about shape.** Not how many agents ran, not whether a task
was spawned, not whether the four repairs happened at once. A serial run that
fixes all four in one turn passes exactly as a fan-out does, and should.

What it does not establish, plainly:

* **Nothing about useful parallelism, and not much work.** Each of the four
  repairs is small — use `csv.reader`, keep a set instead of a variable, take
  the ISO year, add a tie-break — in about 250 lines of Python. This is a
  multi-module correctness and calibration fixture. Whether independent work of
  this size is worth splitting up is an empirical question it does not answer,
  and answering it needs bigger held-out workloads and a serial ablation to
  compare against.
* One language, one domain, one size, one prompt, and a judge with a finite
  number of black-box cases. A repair that satisfies all 29 can still be wrong
  about something nobody wrote a case for, and about anything a module does that
  its command line does not show.
* The judge and the answer keys are **outside the directory the harness was
  pointed at, which is a location and not a sandbox**. Nothing stops a process
  from walking up one directory. The checksums are detection: they say
  afterwards that an instrument moved, and the scenario then refuses to use it.
  What is now structural rather than detected is the process boundary — the
  candidate runs as a child, and the parent holding the expected answers never
  imports it.
* The prompt names the four modules, because every arm must get the same task
  and finding the work is not what is being compared here. It says nothing about
  agents, tasks or parallelism.

Its deterministic tests call no model:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s bench/conversation/test -p 'test_dutylog*.py'
```

They build the fixture the way `run.sh` does and check that it fails in all four
modules before any repair, that the reference repair and an unrelated correct
implementation both pass, that three modules out of four never passes, and that
a hard-coded answer, an edited test, a deleted test, a planted verdict, a
project that hangs on import, a CLI that leaves a grandchild running, and the
review's own `__init__.py` forgery are each caught. `test/selftest.sh` drives the same three outcomes through the real
runner against fake binaries.

## Outcomes

`pass`, `fail`, `timeout`, `crash`, `skipped`, `unsupported` are six different
words and only the first is a success. The summary counts each separately and
the runner's exit code moves for `fail`, `timeout` and `crash` only. A skipped
cell that quietly read as a pass is the failure this whole suite is built to
prevent.

The interactive door adds more, and they are deliberately different words:

| `ended` | what happened | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| `no-midwork-window` | the work never gave a window to steer into | **fail** — the scenario did not happen, so there is nothing to pass |
| `crash` | the pane died | **crash** — the harness failed |
| `noframe` | nothing was ever drawn | **crash** — the harness drew no screen |
| `noready` | a screen WAS drawn and these markers did not match it | **unsupported** — a calibration gap in THIS suite; nothing was driven, so nothing is claimed and the scenario's own checks do not run |

That last row is not a technicality. A live run wired pi to the guard, whose
status bar then read `(guard) …` where the calibration expected
`(openrouter) …`; the driver waited ninety seconds, sent nothing, and the cell
came out as a crash with ten failed assertions against a harness that was
sitting there healthily waiting to be typed at. The marker is now derived from
the provider actually in use, and a screen this suite cannot read is recorded as
this suite's gap.

**A cell whose guard died is `skipped`.** If the forwarding guard exits during a
cell, the harness is dialling a closed port and everything after that — no
reply, no file, no receipt — is about the rig. The cell is skipped with the
guard's exit status on the row, and the scenario's checks do not run.

### When "answered while working" is allowed to be claimed

A transcript that ends with the right answer says nothing about *when* it was
given. A harness that queues the followup, finishes the build, and only then
answers produces a final screen indistinguishable from one that answered
immediately — and an earlier version of this cell passed exactly that. So the
mid-work cells judge order, from four timestamps on one clock:

```
work_started_at      the fixture's own build-started marker
midwork_sent_at      when the driver pressed Enter on the second message
answer_first_seen_at when the answer first appeared on screen (sampled)
work_finished_at     the fixture's own build-finished marker
```

The message is sent only after the work says it started and before it says it
finished. The markers are written by the slow job itself, to an absolute path
baked in when the fixture is generated, so they hold even if the agent copies
the script somewhere else.

The two mid-work cells then part company, because they are asking different
things of the harness:

| cell | asserted | recorded, not asserted |
|---|---|---|
| `followup-while-working` | the answer was seen **before** the work's finish marker | how long the window was |
| `revision-midwork` | `report.csv` was written **after** the revision was sent | whether it was also written before the build finished |

The revision cell stops there on purpose. The person asked for the build *and*
the report; finishing the build first and then writing the CSV does what was
asked, so requiring the file mid-work would score eagerness rather than
correctness. The followup cell is stricter because there the whole point of the
question is that it should not have to wait.

Two weaknesses are named rather than papered over, and travel in `door.json` as
`witness`:

- `work-markers` (the mid-work cells): the answer is a **screen** witness
  sampled every `CONV_POLL` seconds, not an assistant-message event. Sampling
  puts an error bar of one poll on `answer_first_seen_at`. What it cannot be is
  an echo: the followup asks for a word from a file **reversed**
  (`CINNABAR` → `RABANNIC`), so a tool call that prints the file does not
  produce the answer. The match is a whole word — a live omp pane rendered
  `RRABANNIC`, and a substring match had called that correct.
- `screen-busy`: the weaker witness, used only where a scenario has no work of
  its own to mark. A spinner means a model request is in flight, which can be
  true before any work has begun.

## Reading a run

```sh
bench/conversation/summary.sh                 # the newest run
bench/conversation/summary.sh <results.jsonl> # one or more runs
```

It prints, **per workload**, each arm's mean quality (the fraction of that
cell's own assertions that passed), mean cost and mean wall clock, and then the
arms nothing else beats on all three at once. It does not add the workloads
together: one arm being cheaper and another being better is the normal result,
and a single number across coding, research, writing and conversation would be
an average over incomparable things. When one arm is on the frontier everywhere,
the tool says so *and* says how few workloads, rungs and samples that is.

## Evidence

Per run under `bench-results/conversation/<run-id>/`, per cell:

```
config.txt        binary, version, pins, allowlist, effort, isolation, cap, paths
argv.txt          the exact invocation
prompt.txt        the message every arm was given, byte for byte
stdout.log        what the harness streamed
guard-audit.jsonl every request the guard allowed or refused, and why
guard-usage.jsonl what the provider said each of this cell's calls cost
receipt.json      normalised cost, tokens, models, turns
reply.txt         the reply, extracted from whichever shape it arrived in
scrollback.txt    the whole conversation (interactive door)
frames.log        timestamped screen samples, and a full frame per turn
door.json         what the driver observed: ended, turns sent, witness, timings
host-stop.log     the cell's own session host being stopped
judge/            answer keys — outside the workspace the model can see
results.jsonl     one row per cell, with every assertion and its outcome
```

Answer keys live in `judge/`, never in the workspace: a scenario that hands the
model the file it is being marked against is marking the model on reading.

**The workspace is a real one.** codeaf is run the way people run it —
conversations are hosted by default, and `--no-host` is not passed, because a
benchmark that opts out of the product's default is measuring something else.
Each cell has its own workspace, so the host it starts is its own, and when the
cell ends that host is stopped by workspace (`codeaf engine --workspace <cell>
--stop`) before the guard closes. Nothing global is killed and no other
session, benchmark or human, is touched.

`config.txt` records the *names* of credentials present, never a value, and is a
curated list rather than an environment dump: a redaction regex over everything
a shell happens to hold is one unfamiliar variable name away from publishing a
secret.

Evidence is never overwritten by accident, at both levels. A run whose
`results.jsonl` already holds rows refuses **before opening it** — cell-level
refusal alone is not enough, because truncating the summary first and only then
declining to touch the cells leaves the directories intact and destroys the
record of what they were. A cell whose directory already exists refuses too, and
records a skip. `--overwrite` is the deliberate way, and `--out` gives a run a
directory of its own.

Live runs so far, all by the owner:

* `notes/pilot-01.md` — the first print-door cells, and why one of its three
  costs is not usable.
* `notes/pilot-02-03.md` — two full print-door passes over four scenarios, plus
  the first interactive cells against pi and omp. It adjudicates every non-pass
  in those runs: which were real quality misses, which were this suite's own
  defects (a markdown-emphasis assertion, an adapter calibrated before the
  guard existed), and which are unusable because the rig failed under them.

No interactive cell has yet produced a result this suite is willing to quote:
the pi cells never reached a composer, and the omp cell's pass rested on an
assertion too weak to keep.

State is isolated per cell: `CODEAF_HOME` for codeaf, `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` plus
`--session-dir` for pi, `XDG_*` for opencode (declared, not documented by
opencode, and recorded as unverified). omp's documented isolation is a named
profile under `$HOME/.omp/profiles`; this suite creates its own per-cell profile
(and seeds `setupVersion: 2`, without which a fresh profile opens a setup wizard
and the TUI never reaches a composer) and removes **only** a profile it created.
A profile that already exists is **refused**, not reused: it carries settings
this run did not write, including model roles. A name that is not a plain path
component is refused too.

## Testing the rig

```sh
bench/conversation/test/selftest.sh      # deterministic, offline, free
bench/conversation/run.sh --dry-run      # compose every invocation, run none
```

The selftest runs the whole battery against fake binaries whose misbehaviour is
known, and fails if the rig does not catch it: a dropped exit code, a fluent
wrong answer, a harness that hangs, usage that was never reported, a model off
the allowlist (including one reached only by an auxiliary role), a catalog that
cannot pin the id, a scenario an arm has no door for, a followup that never
arrives, a mid-work window that never opens, an existing omp profile, a second
run that would overwrite the first's evidence or truncate its summary, and
credentials leaking into a child process or onto its command line. It also
checks the receipt reader counts a repeated message once — all three peers emit
the same assistant message three times — and that a self-reported `$0` beside
real tokens is read as unknown rather than free.

The coding counterexamples are of the same kind: a fake that repairs all four
defects of `multi-defect-pipeline` must pass, one that makes the workspace's own
suite green by answering it from a table must FAIL on the external judge, and
one whose behaviour is right but which edited a test file must fail on the
checksum rather than on the behaviour.

The interactive counterexamples are the ones to keep. A fake TUI that
**blocks**, finishes the build, and then answers correctly, with the right
derived token and the right build marker, must FAIL. A fake that answers
`RRABANNIC` must fail too — a near miss is a miss. And a fake that draws a
screen these markers do not match must come out `unsupported` with its
scenario's checks unrun, never as a crash blamed on the harness. Its final transcript is a passing one; only
the timestamps say otherwise. The responsive fake must pass, the deaf one must
fail, and a run where the window never opened must not be a pass.

It also drives the guard against a stand-in upstream: a commercial model is
refused with nothing reaching the upstream, an off-allowlist id in a `models`
fallback array is refused the same way, an allowlisted one is forwarded and its
streamed chunks relayed untouched, a caller without the sentinel is refused, an
unreadable body is refused, and the audit log carries the decisions and no
credential. Relaying is timed, not assumed: with the stand-in holding its second
event back for two seconds, the first must reach the client before the second is
sent — a guard that buffered a whole response would leave a live TUI blank for
the length of a generation.

The ledger is tested the same way. A client that hangs up mid-stream must leave
a settled-but-unpriced row rather than silence, the guard must survive it
without answering a request whose headers it already sent, and a priced call
beside it must **not** be reported as the total. An admission with no
settlement — what an abrupt shutdown leaves — reads as unknown too.

At the time of writing it is 112 checks, all passing, and it needs `tmux` and
`curl`; a missing dependency is reported as skipped and exits non-zero rather
than green.

## What this does not establish

One machine, one model, one effort rung. Legacy runs have no paired repetition metadata; the campaign runner adds it. Quality is binary: the verdict and every assertion must pass. This measures what the cell
checks and nothing else — the writing cell counts words and facts, not whether
the memo is any good. The conversation cells use a sleeping script as the slow
job, so they measure whether a followup lands and the work survives, not how a
harness behaves under a genuinely expensive one. Wall clock carries provider
latency and queueing; two runs of identical code have come in 60% apart on the
older batteries in `bench/`.

### Long evidence paths and the hosted codeaf door

codeaf's Unix socket path has a platform limit. The rig supplies a short, owned
`/tmp/afconv-home.*` alias to the cell's state directory; the journal remains
inside the evidence folder. Without that alias a long output path can trigger
the in-process fallback and first-run setup instead of measuring hosted chat.
The alias path is recorded in `state-alias.txt` and removed with other owned
state unless `--keep` is used. First-run setup is not part of these comparisons.

The slow-work fixture records every invocation and preserves its first start
timestamp. Both interactive scenarios reject repeating the prepared action.
Previously a second run could overwrite the start marker and make a correctly
timed user correction look early; that failure is now measured directly.

## Paired campaigns and conservative reports

`campaign.py plan /tmp/experiment.json --id experiment-name --repeats 2` freezes binary and rig hashes and randomizes complete arm blocks. This is offline. `campaign.py run /tmp/experiment.json --out /tmp/experiment-evidence` explicitly executes the plan; failures remain, infrastructure gaps stop the run, completed cells resume without inference, and partial cells require adjudication. Model inference is limited by per-cell runtime caps, not an aggregate dollar cap.

The report now uses **binary outcome success**, separates exact scenario/door/model/effort strata, and keeps failure costs. Legacy runs are descriptive only. Declared expected arms prevent an entirely missing competitor from disappearing. Paired intervals require at least five complete blocks; missing billing/time prevents the corresponding interval. Equal small all-success samples do not prove equivalence. An observed nondominated set is exploratory and withheld if cost/time coverage is incomplete.

Cancelled streams may lack their final usage event. The guard records generation IDs, request identities, and timing without prompt contents. After the owned runtime stops, `reconcile.py` can obtain read-only generation billing metadata from OpenRouter. It preserves the raw ledger and writes a derived ledger and receipts; ID/model mismatches, unfinished records, or unavailable prices stay unknown. No inference is retried to recover a price.

The product goals, staged comparison protocol, holdout requirement, and proposed acceptance margins are in [PARETO.md](../../docs/design/conversation-runtime/PARETO.md). Run `python3 -m unittest discover -s bench/conversation/test -p 'test_*.py'` alongside the existing shell selftest when changing measurement code.

### A free chat is not a finished background action

Once a scenario's work-start marker exists, the terminal driver keeps observing until its work-finish marker or the cap, even if the composer becomes idle. Otherwise an agent that correctly frees the chat can have its background action killed by the rig. The `idlework` counterexample stages exactly that shape; the previous driver failed it. This fixes the observation boundary, not a product runtime. Interactive evidence collected before this correction must be adjudicated before comparing it.

Create `STOP` in a campaign's output directory to stop after the current cell finishes. The runner preserves completed cells and does not begin another. Remove that file before explicitly resuming. The per-cell cap still bounds a cell already in flight.

## File timestamps on macOS and Linux

The timing helpers select the native `stat` syntax before reading a file's
modification time. Trying BSD flags on GNU stat can print a filesystem report
even when the command fails, corrupting a subsequent timestamp comparison.
`test/test_common.py` covers both dialects and that noisy failure. If an older
run has this defect, preserve its original verdicts and replay only the affected
timing assertion from retained timestamps; record the corrected helper and input
hashes. Do not silently discard the assertion or rerun model work.
