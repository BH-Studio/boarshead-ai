# work-result-recalled — after work has been done, is the person told what it
# actually produced when they ask?
#
# The narrow question, stated exactly. A piece of work is asked for, the
# conversation settles, and then the person asks what came back. The check is
# that the number the screen gives afterwards is the number really in the file.
# That is a RECALL check: it catches a session that writes the right file and
# then tells the person a different figure, which is a real way to lose an
# answer.
#
# WHAT THIS CELL DOES NOT ESTABLISH, and must not be quoted for:
#
#   * that any task was spawned, that a checkpoint or a task node existed, or
#     that anything ran on after the reply. Nothing here asserts a shape, and a
#     build that answers in one turn with no task at all passes — correctly, on
#     this question.
#   * that a result is delivered AUTOMATICALLY. The person has to ask. A
#     session that finishes work and says nothing until prompted passes this
#     cell, so it cannot be evidence of automatic delivery. That is a separate
#     live check, run against the product's own task surface, and it is not in
#     this suite.
#
# It runs on codeaf alone because it is codeaf's terminal being examined, not
# because a claim is made about what the other arms can or cannot hand off.
