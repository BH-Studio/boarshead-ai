# writing-memo — the writing workload, through the print door.
#
# Writing is the workload where a benchmark most easily fools itself: any fluent
# paragraph looks like success. So the cell asks for a deliverable with
# constraints that are countable — a file, a length ceiling, three facts that
# must appear, one word that must not, and an audience that rules out jargon.
# Every check is a fact about the file on disk. Whether the prose is any good is
# not claimed here, and the README says so.

Using the notes in notes/, write a short handover memo for whoever is on call
next weekend. Save it as memo.md in this directory.

Requirements, all of them:
- at most 150 words
- name the team that currently owns kestrel, kestrel's port, and the rollback
  command
- plain language for someone who has not worked on this service: no jargon, and
  do not use the word "synergy"
- end with a single line beginning "Escalation:" that says where escalation goes
