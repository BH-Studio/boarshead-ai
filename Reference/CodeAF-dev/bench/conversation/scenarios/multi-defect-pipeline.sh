# multi-defect-pipeline — a multi-module correctness fixture, through the print
# door.
#
# One small Python project with four independent defects, one each in parsing,
# validation, aggregation and rendering, plus the command-line pipeline that
# joins them. Each defect is found and fixed on its own; the pipeline's output
# is only right when all four are. The four repairs are small — a CSV reader, a
# set instead of a variable, an ISO year, a tie-break — so this is a calibration
# fixture for separable work and its integration, not a demonstration that there
# is enough work here to be worth splitting up.
#
# IT ASSERTS NOTHING ABOUT SHAPE. Not how many agents ran, not whether a task
# was spawned, not whether the work was done in parallel or in one long turn. A
# harness that repairs all four modules serially passes exactly as a harness
# that fans out does, and should: the person asked for working software.
#
# The judge is external and black-box: it runs the repaired project's own
# command line as a child process, on inputs the workspace never contained, and
# reads stdout, stderr and the exit status. It never imports the candidate and
# never reads its source, so a rewrite passes, a lookup table keyed on the
# visible test data does not, and candidate code cannot reach into the process
# that holds the expected answers. The workspace's own suite is the map, not the
# mark: it is checksummed before the run, and the judge outside decides.

This Python project turns a duty-log CSV into a weekly report. Its own test
suite fails:

    python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t .

Four modules under dutylog/ are wrong — parsing, validation, aggregate and
report — and each of the four failures has its own separate cause. Fix the code
under dutylog/ so that the suite passes and the pipeline is correct end to end:

    python3 -m dutylog.cli --input LOG.csv --from 2026-12-28 --to 2027-01-10

SPEC.md is the contract; read it, and prefer it over any guess about what a
failing assertion meant.

Do not change, weaken or delete anything under tests/ or SPEC.md — they are
correct and the code is not. Your work is judged by behaviour on inputs that are
not in this directory, including the combined output of the pipeline.
