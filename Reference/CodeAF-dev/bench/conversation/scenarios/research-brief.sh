# Research here is "read what is written down and join it", not "recall what you
# were trained on". The facts are invented tokens that exist nowhere but the
# fixture, so an answer carrying them was read rather than remembered — and one
# of the four files is a superseded note that contradicts the current one, so an
# answer that stops at the first hit gets the ownership question wrong.

The notes/ directory in this folder holds a service's operational notes. Read
them and answer, in a few sentences:

1. Which team currently owns the kestrel service, and how many services does
   that team own?
2. Which port does kestrel listen on, and what is its health endpoint?
3. What caused incident INC-4471, and what was the peak p99 in milliseconds?

Some notes are out of date; say which answer you had to reconcile. Do not write
any files.
