Read ledger.csv in this directory and answer three questions about it. Refunded
rows are not revenue and must be excluded from every figure.

1. What is the net revenue in US dollars, to two decimal places?
2. Which region has the highest net revenue, and what is that region's net revenue?
3. How many rows were refunded?

Answer with the three figures. Do not write any files.
