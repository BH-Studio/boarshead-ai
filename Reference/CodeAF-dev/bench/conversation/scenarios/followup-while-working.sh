# A person starts something slow and then, while it runs, asks a second
# question. Two outcomes are worth having and this cell wants both:
#
#   the followup is answered      — the second question got a real answer, from
#                                   a file only the fixture knows about, so the
#                                   answer had to be looked up rather than
#                                   guessed
#   the first job is not lost     — the slow work still finished, and its result
#                                   is still on the screen
#
# A harness that answers the followup by abandoning the build has not done what
# was asked, and neither has one that ignores the person until the build ends.
# Both failures are visible here and neither can be seen through --print.

# THE ANSWER IS THE CHECKSUM WORD REVERSED. That is deliberate. CINNABAR appears
# in NOTES.txt, so a tool call that cats the file puts it on the screen without
# anybody having answered anything; RABANNIC cannot come from an echo. It is
# still a screen witness rather than a transcript event — recorded in door.json
# as such — but it cannot be produced by the file passing through the terminal.
#
# THE MATCH IS A WHOLE WORD. A live omp pane rendered the answer as "RRABANNIC"
# — a duplicated leading character, whether from the renderer or from the model
# — and a substring match called that the right answer. Either it is the word or
# it is not; a benchmark that accepts a near miss has stopped checking.
