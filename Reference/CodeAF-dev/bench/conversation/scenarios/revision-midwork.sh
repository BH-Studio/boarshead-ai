# This is the failure mode that costs real money in real use. The harness is
# asked for one deliverable, and halfway through is told the shape was wrong.
# Three outcomes are possible and only one of them is right:
#
#   right    the revised deliverable exists, correct, and the abandoned one is
#            not left lying around
#   stale    the original is delivered anyway — the revision was heard and not
#            acted on, or was queued until after the work finished
#   both     both files exist, which is the answer that looks like compliance
#            and leaves the person to work out which one to trust
#
# The checks below tell those three apart on disk. Nothing is asserted about
# how the harness organised itself to do it.
#
# WHAT THIS CELL DOES NOT ASSERT, deliberately. The revised file is required to
# be written AFTER the revision was sent — otherwise it is not an answer to the
# revision — but NOT before the slow job finishes. The person asked for both the
# build and the report; finishing the build first and then writing the CSV is a
# legitimate way to do what was asked, and failing it would be scoring
# eagerness rather than correctness. The timing is recorded so it can be read.
# The sibling cell, followup-while-working, is the one that asserts an answer
# arrived mid-work, because there the whole point of the question is that it
# should not have to wait.
