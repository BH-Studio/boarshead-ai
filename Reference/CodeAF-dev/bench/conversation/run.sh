# Run the conversation battery: every scenario crossed with every arm that has
# an honest door for it, one isolated workspace and state root per cell, and a
# receipt kept for everything that is claimed afterwards.
#
# THIS SPENDS REAL MONEY AND IS ON DEMAND. Nothing in `make check` reaches it.
#
# Read bench/conversation/README.md before quoting a number from it. Three
# things in particular are not conventions but the point of the suite:
#
#   the doors     a `--print` row and a terminal row are different measurements
#                 and are never mixed. An arm with no interactive door here is
#                 recorded `unsupported`, not quietly run through the other one.
#   the pin       every arm is handed the same exact catalog id, and every model
#                 in a cell's own receipts is checked against the allowlist
#                 afterwards. Open models only.
#   the outcomes  pass, fail, timeout, crash, unsupported and skipped are six
#                 different words. None of the last four is a pass.
#
# Usage:
#   bench/conversation/run.sh --dry-run                compose everything, run nothing
#   bench/conversation/run.sh --scenarios data-tally   one cell
#   bench/conversation/run.sh --arms codeaf,pi         two arms
#   bench/conversation/run.sh --door print             only the non-interactive door
