#
# It is the blind live A/B that bench/lanelab/REPORT.md says is worth doing
# ONLY AFTER the three defects in that report are fixed. As written it defaults
# to --dry-run and prints what it would do; running it for real needs --go, and
# --go spends money.
#
# WHAT IT COSTS WHEN IT IS RUN. Two arms x $PROMPTS prompts x $REPS replicates,
# through the real codeaf CLI on the real model. At the default 40 prompts and
# 3 replicates that is 240 sessions. bench/ab-routing measured this shape of
# experiment at roughly $0.02-$0.06 a session on ds-v4-flash, so budget
# $6-$15 and about two hours of wall clock at CONCURRENCY=6. Arm B additionally
# pays for hedges: REPORT.md finding 3 measured the hedge firing on up to 95% of
# long-generation requests, so if that defect is not fixed first, arm B's bill
# can be TWICE arm A's and the experiment will have measured the bug.
#
#   bench/lanelab/live.sh                      # dry run, prints the plan
#   ARM=a bench/lanelab/live.sh --go           # arm A, for real
#   ARM=b bench/lanelab/live.sh --go           # arm B, for real
#   bench/lanelab/live.sh --compare            # the diff, arms relabelled X/Y
#
# ── THE DESIGN, IN THE SPIRIT OF bench/ab-routing/DESIGN.md SECTION 1 ───────
#
# TWO ARMS OVER THE SAME PROMPT SET. Arm A is today's shipped configuration,
# untouched: no environment set at all. The point of a baseline is that it is
# the thing already running, not a reconstruction of it, so the arm-A branch of
# the case block below is deliberately empty and must stay that way. Arm B sets
# one variable, which is the entire difference between the arms.
#
# THE SAME PRICE TABLE FOR BOTH ARMS. Cost is read from the usage ledger's own
# `usd`, which both arms compute from the same catalog, and the per-lane
# tariffs come from the endpoint sheet both arms fetch. Neither arm is allowed
# to price itself. If arm B ever needs a price table arm A does not have, the
# experiment is broken and this script should refuse rather than paper over it.
#
# THE METRIC IS THE DIFF OF THE TWO LEDGERS, NEVER A COUNT OF WINS. Both arms
# write ~/.codeaf/v3/usage.jsonl. The comparison is the distribution of
# `ttft_ms`, `tps`, and `usd` and the totals of `hedged` and `hedge_waste_usd`,
# per arm, side by side. A count of which arm was faster on more prompts is not
# evidence: it answers a different question from the one anybody has, which is
# what the p90 wait and the bill are.
#
# ONE SESSION AT A TIME, ON PURPOSE. bench/ab-routing runs its cells in
# parallel because its metric is a grade and latency is only a cost. Here
# latency IS the metric: six concurrent sessions would queue against the same
# endpoints and the arms would be measuring their own contention. Sequential is
# slower and it is the only way these numbers mean anything.
#
# THE ARMS ARE BLIND TO THE ANALYSIS. Each arm writes arm-$ARM.jsonl. The
# compare step reads both files, computes every number, and only then attaches
# the labels -- and it attaches X and Y, not A and B, so that whoever reads the
# output has to look up which was which deliberately rather than seeing the
# answer they expected. The mapping is written to arm-map.txt at compare time.
