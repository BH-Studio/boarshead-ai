// Command gosim replays `bench/lanelab`'s three scenarios against the SHIPPED
// lane router and prints the ship gate.
//
// ── WHY THERE IS A SECOND SIMULATOR ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `bench/lanelab/sim.py` is a reference model: it re-implements the design in
// Python, it is quick to change, and it found five of the seven corrections in
// docs/design/routing/provider-routing.md Part III. But a second implementation agreeing
// with the first is not evidence about the build. So this program drives the
// REAL registry — `lane.Default()`'s real ledger primed from the same sheet
// fixture, the real chooser, the real watch, the real budget — against
// `internal/lane/lanestub`, over the same three scenarios, the same eight
// seeds, and the same objective. THE SHIP DECISION IS TAKEN HERE
// (docs/design/routing/provider-routing.md, Part III, C6); the Python table is the bug
// report when the two disagree.
//
// It is a main package under bench/, so none of it is in the shipped binary.
//
//	go run ./bench/lanelab/gosim                       the committed run
//	go run ./bench/lanelab/gosim -requests 200         a quick one
//	go run ./bench/lanelab/gosim -json out.json        same, plus the raw table
//	go run ./bench/lanelab/gosim -scenario talk -policy belief+hedge

// ── THE SHIP GATE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The gate of docs/design/routing/provider-routing.md Part III, C3, in the design's own
// economics and not in a percentage from nowhere.
//
// THE SPEED HALF IS THE P90 OF WHAT THE SCENARIO ACTUALLY BUYS. For `work` and
// `offpath` that is the wait. For `talk` it is the FIRST TOKEN alone: above the
// reading rate every lane is the same speed to a person, so a talk turn's whole
// prize is the empty line before the stream starts, and gating it on the wait
// would grade the design partly on a term it has no way to move.
//
// THE MONEY HALF IS λ. A router that spends a dollar to buy more than λ seconds
// has, by the design's own arithmetic, made a good trade, so the clause IS that
// trade, per request: Δ$ ≤ Δ(mean wait)/λ. At λ = 0 the right-hand side is zero
// and the rule degenerates to "it must not cost more than the baseline", which
// is exactly what background work should demand.
//
// AND AT λ = 0 THE SPEED HALF IS A GUARD RATHER THAN A DEMAND. λ is the
// statement that a second is worth nothing; a router told that and then graded
// on seconds is being graded on the one term it was instructed to ignore, and
// no correct implementation of this design can pass such a clause — it would
// have to disobey the objective to do it. What is worth demanding of work
// nobody is waiting on is that the wait does not BLOW OUT while the bill comes
// down, so the clause becomes: no dearer than the baseline, and no slower than
// [gateWaitBlowout] times it. The ceiling is a factor rather than a percentage
// because at λ = 0 the two quantities are not commensurable — there is no
// exchange rate between them, which is precisely what λ = 0 says.
const gateP90Improve = 0.30

// gateWaitBlowout is how much slower than the baseline the p90 wait may be
// before a λ = 0 arm is refused. Two is the point at which "the same work,
// later" becomes "a different experience": a background answer that took twice
// as long is one somebody may still be waiting on when they come back to it,
// and no saving on the bill buys that back.
const gateWaitBlowout = 2.0

// baseline is the arm every other arm is graded against.
//
// IT IS NOT THE ONE THE DESIGN RETIRES, and that is a defect in this run rather
// than a choice — see [strikeNote]. `sim.py` grades against `strike-ledger`, the
// strike table in `internal/provider/velocity.go`; this program cannot reach
// that mechanism without editing shipped code, so it grades against the arm it
// can reach honestly, which is what a request gets today when nothing in the
// harness has an opinion.
const baseline = policyDefault

// strikeNote is why the `strike` arm is missing, printed with the table so that
// nobody has to go looking for it.
const strikeNote = "the `strike` arm (today's velocity ledger with sort: latency) is NOT RUN: " +
	"`velocityLedger`, its `observe` and its `preferences` are unexported and the one " +
	"process-wide instance has no exported reset, so a bench cannot prime it, clear it " +
	"between seeds, or drive it except through a whole provider.Client — and its cooldown " +
	"reads the wall clock, which a run on a divided clock cannot move. Reaching it needs a " +
	"seam added to internal/provider, which this lane may not touch. The gate below is " +
	"therefore taken against `default` and NOT against the mechanism the design retires."
