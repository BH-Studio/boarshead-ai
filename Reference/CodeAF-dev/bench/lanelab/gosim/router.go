// ── THIS PROGRAM'S FIFTY LINES OF TRANSPORT ─────────────────────────────────
//
// The contract in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md Decision 10, written out: ask, send,
// watch, fold back. It is the same shape as `e2eRouter` in
// `internal/lane/e2e_test.go` and it is written again here rather than imported
// because a test file's helpers belong to the test binary — and because this
// one has to do three things that file does not: run three named policies
// against one world, drive the real [lane.Watch] rather than only the choice's
// deadline, and keep books a benchmark can be argued with from.
//
// ── THE TWO CLOCKS, AND WHY THE FAST ONE IS NOT USED ────────────────────────
//
// A scenario written in the units of the world takes hours. So THE WIRE RUNS
// [speedup] TIMES FASTER THAN THE WORLD IT DESCRIBES, and nothing else does:
// every duration that crosses into the ledger, every moment a request carries,
// and every figure printed is in the world's own units, and only the timers
// armed against the socket are divided.
//
// `lanestub.Fast` — the clock that costs nothing — is NOT USED, and the reason
// is worth stating because the obvious reading of "use the fast clock" is that
// it would make this run in seconds. It cannot, for two independent reasons.
// The first is the one `lanestub.go` states itself: it is ONE TIMELINE shared by
// every request in flight, and the hedge arm exists precisely to put two
// streams in flight at once. The second is stronger and is a property of the
// stub rather than of this program: A STREAMED ANSWER CARRIES NO CLOCK. Its
// chunks are stamped `created: 0`, so a client reading a stream served on the
// fast clock sees every token arrive at once and can measure neither a first
// token nor a rate — the two quantities this whole bench is about. Only
// `serveWhole`, the non-streaming path, stamps the clock's own moment. So the
// fast clock is unusable by anything that times a stream off the wire, and the
// speedup discipline is the only one available.
//
// What that costs is measured rather than assumed: every request records how
// much of its first token was the socket rather than the script, and the median
// of that is printed with the table.
