// ── §K, MEASURED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `docs/design/waiting/DESIGN.md` §K sets four pass criteria that are about the
// INVARIANT rather than about the average, and §J stages them as four
// scenarios. This file is those four scenarios and that table, driven against
// the same shipped code the rest of this program drives — the real chooser, the
// real ledger, the real [lane.PlanFor], and the real controller `internal/lane`
// installs at init — over `internal/lane/lanestub`.
//
// ── WHY IT IS NOT A FOURTH POLICY ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The three scenarios above COMPARE ARMS: three policies against one baseline,
// graded on a p90. These four compare nothing. Each row stages one state the
// design claims to bound and reports what the build did in it, because "no call
// waits longer than the role's ceiling" is not a quantity with a baseline — it
// held on every trial or it did not, and a ceiling that holds 99% of the time
// is not a ceiling. So a proof row reuses the scenario (λ, the token counts,
// the quality bar), the world, the one price table and the seeds, and brings
// its own staging and its own table.
//
// ── HOW EACH ROW IS STAGED ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every row runs the `talk` scenario under [lane.RoleTalk], which is the role
// §K's first criterion names: the shortest ceiling in the table, and the role
// the reported defect happened under.
//
// Every row runs its fault for the MIDDLE HALF of its requests, exactly as the
// three scenarios above break their victim between request n/4 and 3n/4. That
// is what makes one run answer two criteria at once: the sick half is where
// time-to-action is measured, and the healthy half is where a false hedge would
// have to come from.
//
//   - COLD STORE — a fresh CODEAF_HOME, nothing primed, no sheet. The chooser
//     therefore has nothing to rank and returns an empty [lane.Choice], the
//     plan is built with no belief and no alternative, and the lane that serves
//     goes silent for [quietFor]. This is the reported defect's own state, and
//     it is staged with a silence as well as with a cold store because §K's
//     first criterion is the INTERSECTION of the two: a cold store with nothing
//     to wait for proves nothing about a clock.
//   - STALLED LANE — the sheet primed, the modal lane quiet [stallWords]
//     visible words into its answer ([lanestub.Profile.StallAfter] /
//     `StallFor`). The writing phase's own distribution is what has to catch
//     this one.
//   - THINKING MODEL — [lanestub.Profile.Reasoning] deltas before the first
//     visible word, at a rate slow enough that the run of thought lasts seconds
//     of the world. The healthy half is a legitimately long think that must NOT
//     be hedged; the sick half stalls INSIDE the run of thought and must be.
//   - PINNED LANE — a choice that sends `only:[pin]`, which is what
//     `internal/provider/lanes.go` builds for a pin and what
//     `internal/provider/waitplan.go` reads to set [control.Plan.Pinned]. Run
//     twice: with a reader for the offer, where the act is the question and
//     nothing is sent, and without one, where §E says a headless run borrows at
//     the ceiling once and says so.
//
// ── WHAT THIS BENCH CANNOT REACH ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// "No reader" is `provider.OnPhase` having no registered reader, and this
// program does not import `internal/provider` — it never has, and a bench that
// grew an import into the package it is judging would be a bench that changed
// its own subject. So THE OFFER REGISTRY HALF OF §E IS NOT EXERCISED HERE: what
// is exercised is the controller's act, [control.Ask], and the two things a
// caller does with it. The reader row leaves the offer standing; the headless
// row converts it into the borrow §E describes. That conversion is THIS FILE's,
// not the build's, and REPORT.md says so beside the number.
//
// ── THE CLOCK, AND THE ONE PLACE THIS BENCH SPINS ───────────────────────────
//
// The wire runs [speedup] times faster than the world, as everywhere else here,
// and every figure reported is in the world's own units. That is a problem for
// exactly one measurement: a ten-second ceiling is a hundred milliseconds of
// wire, and a Go timer armed for a hundred milliseconds returns a fraction of a
// millisecond late — which is tens of milliseconds of the world, enough to make
// a ceiling that held exactly read as ten seconds and a bit. That would be this
// bench failing its own instrument and calling it a build failing its
// invariant. So [prover.ringAt] sleeps to within [spinWire] of the moment and
// spins the rest, and what is left over is measured on every act and printed
// with the table as the alarm's own lateness.

	// ── WHY THE FLAT 3% ON THE TOTAL IS NOT THE GATE ────────────────────────
	//
	// §K's spend clause was a flat 3% of the whole bill, and on the natural mix
	// it is REPORTED rather than gated. The reason is not that the total is
	// forced: a lane of this bench once claimed a rescue was an unavoidable
	// arithmetic floor, and THE BASELINE ARM REFUTED IT — a build with no
	// waiting policy at all, which never arms and never rescues, came in at
	// $1.3930 and $1.4194 against the policy's $1.3725 and $1.4812 on the same
	// worlds. A cheaper way to spend the money exists; it just answers a broken
	// request twenty seconds later instead of ten.
	//
	// So the total is a PRICE and not a floor, and what it buys is latency. It
	// is reported with the baseline beside it so that a reader can see the
	// exchange rate rather than be told a number was inevitable.
	//
	// ── WHAT A CONTROLLER CAN BE HELD TO ────────────────────────────────────

	// lost to the lane they were rescuing. Nothing else in the bill is a
	// decision this package makes badly rather than a decision it makes.

	// THE CEILING IS THE MEASURED MAXIMUM ACROSS BOTH SEED SETS TIMES A HALF
	// AGAIN. On the four gated arms — a warmed store at the natural rate,
	// against both doors, on seeds 7/9/11 and 23/25/27 — avoidable measured
	// 0.55%, 0.60%, 0.41% and 0.50%. The maximum is 0.60% and 0.60 × 1.5 = 0.90.
	// The seed-to-seed spread on one door is 0.14 and 0.10 points, so half again
	// leaves about two to three times that as headroom: an honest seed cannot
	// fail it and a doubling is caught.
	//
	// IT WAS RE-DERIVED, AND THE FIRST DERIVATION WAS NOT THIS. An earlier pass
	// set it at 1.3% from `waste on a healthy lane` — a PROXY measured before
	// the avoidable metric existed — on both seed sets. This figure is derived
	// from the avoidable metric itself, on both seed sets, and it is lower.
	//
	// AND A CEILING FITTED TO ITS OWN RUN CANNOT FAIL THAT RUN. This bound is a

	// REPORT.md says so where the number appears.

//
// IT IS THE WRONG STATE FOR A COST. §K's false-hedge and spend bounds describe
// what the mechanism costs in the steady state a person actually sits in, and a
// process that has never measured a pair has to explore to find out which lane
// is quick — exploration the purse bounds and the bill records. Grading the
// steady-state bounds on an all-cold mix grades the design on its first minute
// forever. So the rows are run again over a WARMED store and the four bounds

// So there is a second policy. It routes exactly as the other one does — the
// chooser is the same, because routing and waiting are two questions and only
// one of them is under test — and then it WAITS. If the wire goes quiet longer
// than the transport's own guard allows, the attempt is thrown away whole and

// proofGates is §K's four criteria, each read off the rows it is about, and

//
// WHICH ROW ANSWERS WHICH CRITERION IS NOT ARBITRARY. The ceiling criterion
// names its own state — a stalled lane, a cold store, the talk role — so it is
// read off the silent row, which is the only one that is all three at once, and
// every other row's fault window is reported beside it. The false-hedge and the
// spend criteria are about a build's ordinary behaviour and are pooled over
// every row. The long-think criterion exists only where there is a think.
//
// ── WHICH ARM DECIDES WHAT, AND WHY ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ON A WARMED STORE ALL FOUR BOUNDS ARE ENFORCED. That is the steady state §K's
// numbers describe — two per cent of extra traffic is Dean & Barroso's figure
// for a system that knows its own service times — and it is the state a person
// sits in for all but the first minute of a session.
//
// ON A COLD STORE THE INVARIANT IS ENFORCED AND THE COSTS ARE REPORTED. A
// process that has never measured a pair cannot know which lane is quick, and
// the arms it sends to find out are EXPLORATION rather than false hedges: they
// are how the ledger stops being cold. What has to bound them is not §K's
// steady-state figure but the purse, which is the mechanism the design gives
// for exactly this — so the cold arms gate on the purse's own ceiling instead,
// and the two §K cost figures are printed beside it without a verdict. The
