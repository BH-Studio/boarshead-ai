// Everything in this file is the SCENERY: the seventeen lanes of one live
// endpoint sheet, the log-normal-with-a-tail each of them behaves by, the one
// price table every arm is charged through, and the capability gate the
// baseline is given so that it is not a strawman. None of it is a policy and
// none of it is a belief.
//
// It is a line-for-line port of the generative half of `bench/lanelab/sim.py`,
// and it is a port rather than a fresh model on purpose: the two programs are
// worth putting side by side only if the world they disagree about is the same
// world. Where a constant here has a name in that file, it is spelled the same
// way, so the two can be diffed by eye.

//
// A rate of thirty tokens a second at a speedup of two hundred is a gap of a
// sixth of a millisecond, and a Go timer armed for a sixth of a millisecond on
// the machine this was written on returns after about six tenths of one — the
// overshoot is roughly 0.5–0.65 ms for every sleep under two milliseconds, and
// it does not shrink with the sleep. So a forty-token stream costs
// thirty-nine such sleeps whatever it was scripted for, its measured rate is a
// measurement of this machine's scheduler, and the wall time of the whole run
// is set by the timer rather than by the world.
//
// (That is also why `internal/lane/e2e_test.go`'s note — that a hundredfold
// speedup leaves a scripted duration "two orders of magnitude above the
// loopback round trip" — names the wrong constant. The loopback round trip is
// not what binds; the timer's own floor is, and at a hundredfold it is fifty
// milliseconds of world time on every scripted wait.)
//
// So the split is made explicitly rather than left to be discovered in a
// number: THE FIRST TOKEN IS MEASURED OFF THE WIRE — one sleep, long enough to
// survive the floor, and what it cost is reported with the table — and THE RATE
// IS THE WORLD'S OWN DRAW, carried beside the stream and never read off it. The
// rate that reaches [lane.PerceivedSeconds], the rate that reaches the ledger's
// own filter and the rate `sim.py` uses are then the same number, which is the
// only way the two tables mean the same thing.
//
// Four billion is chosen so that `time.Second / Rate` truncates to zero and
// `lanestub`'s clock is never armed at all between tokens.
const instantRate = 4e9

// streamTokens is how many tokens the fake router actually writes.
//
// IT IS A SAMPLE OF THE ANSWER AND NOT THE ANSWER. A `work` request is scored
// on two thousand hidden tokens; writing two thousand chunks through a socket a
// hundred and forty thousand times would take a day, and the reference model in
// `sim.py` does not write them either — it draws a first token and a rate and
// does arithmetic. What this program buys by writing any of them at all is that
// the first token and the rate are MEASURED off a real wire by real code rather
// than asserted, and the wait and the bill for the whole answer are then the
// same arithmetic `sim.py` does, on numbers that were measured.
//
// FORTY AND NOT TWENTY-FOUR. `lanestub.DefaultTokens` is 24 and
// `internal/lane/belief.go`'s `ratedFloor` is 32: an answer under the floor
// teaches the ledger its first token and never its rate. So a run scripted at
// the stub's default would drive the shipped ledger with the rate filter
// switched off for its whole length — see REPORT.md, which reports that
// `internal/lane/e2e_test.go` has exactly that hole.
