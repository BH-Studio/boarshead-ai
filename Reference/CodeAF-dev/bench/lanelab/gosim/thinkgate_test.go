// ── WHEN THE THINK CLOCK'S ABNORMALITY GATE CLOSES ──────────────────────────
//
// §B's second test asks whether a wait is past the (1 − p) quantile of the very
// survival that clock reads. For the DURATION clock that survival is
// [lane.Thinks] — the four-level chain over how long this model's whole run of
// thought lasts — and the spread it is judged at is `Chain.Survival`'s larger of
// two: the estimate's own, and how much ONE DRAW of the quantity varies
// (waiting.go: `Sigma: math.Max(math.Sqrt(variance), draw)`).
//
// A THINKING PHASE HAS NO PUBLISHED DRAW, WHICH IS WHY THIS TEST EXISTS. While
// `Thinks` passed the bare [lane.SpreadFloor] the second term was a constant,
// it was always the larger, and the quantile sat at fifteen times the believed
// median — permanently past the role's ceiling, at any amount of evidence. The
// gate could not close, and this test asserted that it did not, so the
// limitation could not go stale unnoticed.
//
// IT IS OBSERVED WHERE IT IS NOT PUBLISHED (#316). Every thinking duration
// folded through the real [lane.NoteThought] door is one draw of exactly that
// quantity, so the chain keeps its own account of them and the floor gives way
// to what has been measured. This test now measures WHERE it gives way, in
// observations through that same door.
