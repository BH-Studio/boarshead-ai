"""Fetch one model's lane sheet from OpenRouter and save it verbatim.

A model id is an address; the LANE is the machine behind it. OpenRouter
publishes, per model, one row per endpoint with that endpoint's own tariff,
its own capability facts, and a thirty-minute distribution of first-token
wait and throughput. That sheet is the prior the whole lane design starts
from -- see docs/design/routing/provider-routing.md section 1 -- and this script is the
only thing in the lab that touches the network.

TWO RULES, AND THEY ARE THE WHOLE FILE.

VERBATIM. The router's JSON body is written through untouched, under a "data"
key that is the body itself, with exactly one key added around it:
"fetched_at". Nothing is renamed, unitised or flattened. sim.py reads the
router's own field names -- `pricing.completion`, `uptime_last_5m`,
`latency_last_30m.p90` -- so that a reader can diff a saved sheet against a
fresh curl and see the same words. A reshaping step here would be a place for
the sim and the router to disagree silently about what a number meant.

DATED. A sheet is a thirty-minute aggregate, so it is a photograph and not a
fact. The timestamp is what lets a report say which afternoon its numbers
came from, and it is why the file is committed next to the report rather
than refetched at read time.

Usage:  python3 fetch_sheet.py --model deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash [--out sheets/]
