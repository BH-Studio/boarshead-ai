"""Four routing policies over one real lane sheet, ten thousand requests each.

WHY A SIMULATOR AT ALL. The lane design in docs/design/routing/provider-routing.md
proposes to retire a shipped mechanism -- the fixed-threshold strike ledger in
internal/provider/velocity.go -- and replace it with a belief, a Pareto prune,
a per-request scalar and a hedge. That is a lot of machinery to put on the send
path, and the only responsible way to decide whether it earns its place is to
ask what it would have done, against the two things it claims to beat, on
numbers nobody in this repo chose. The sheet is those numbers: OpenRouter's own
thirty-minute percentiles for all seventeen lanes of one model, fetched by
fetch_sheet.py and committed next to this file.

WHAT A SIMULATOR CANNOT DECIDE. It cannot tell you the design works. It can
tell you the design's own arithmetic is or is not self-consistent, it can tell
you which of the four policies the sheet's spread actually separates, and it
can refuse a design cheaply before a live A/B spends money on it. REPORT.md
says where this model is wrong; read that section before quoting any number
from here.

THE HONESTY LAWS THIS FILE IS BUILT ON (bench/README.md):

  ONE PRICE TABLE FOR EVERY ARM. There is exactly one price function,
  `request_price`, it reads the sheet's own `pricing` strings, and all four
  policies are charged through it. A benchmark where the arms price themselves
  is a benchmark that measures its own bookkeeping.

  ONE CAPABILITY GATE FOR EVERY ARM. Tools, output ceiling, context, status and
  five-minute uptime are applied to all four policies, not just to the design's.
  The real router refuses a lane that cannot take a tool call whoever asks it,
  so handing that refusal to the design alone would credit it with a win it did
  not earn. What the design gets to itself is the belief, the prune, the scalar
  and the hedge -- and those have to carry the result on their own.

  JUDGE THE DIFF, NOT A COUNT. Nothing here reports how often a policy "won" a
  request. The comparison is the distribution: p50, p90 and p99 of the wait,
  and dollars per thousand requests, side by side, with the ship gate applied
  to EVERY arm against one named baseline and printed as PASS or FAIL with the
  two quantities that decided it. A policy that wins 70% of requests and loses
  the p90 has lost.

  MEASURE THE WAIT, NOT THE READING. The objective counts only the seconds a
  person spends waiting. It used to count the seconds they spend reading too,
  and since nobody can route around reading, every ratio computed from those
  numbers was a ratio of mostly reading -- which is how a router with no effect
  at all gets reported as a 5% win. See `wait_seconds` below.

  AUTOPSY BEFORE QUOTING. Three findings fell out of running this and all three
  are in REPORT.md rather than smoothed away here: the design's quality gate is
  unreachable from its own prior (Beta(8,1) has mean 0.889 against a q_need of
  0.97) and absorbing once it fires; its price term is worth microseconds
  against a scenario's lambda, so the scalar is pure wait at these token
  counts; and its hedge budget, denominated in wall clock, does not bind
  on the long requests that are expensive to hedge. `--sweep` exists because of
  the second of those: the `work` verdict is not stable across seeds.

Usage:  python3 sim.py [--seed 7] [--n 10000] [--sheet sheets/....json]
                       [--json out.json] [--sweep K]

`--sweep K` re-runs the ship gate over K seeds and reports whether the verdict
is a property of the design or of the seed. It exists because the first run of
this file produced a `work` verdict that reversed between seed 7 and seed 11,
and quoting seed 7 alone would have been a number chosen after the fact.

    """How long a person WAITS on an answer, in seconds.

    A line-for-line port of `lane.PerceivedSeconds` in internal/lane/lane.go,
    named here for what it measures rather than for the Go symbol, because the
    whole point of the correction below is that this is a WAIT and not a
    duration. If the simulator and the chooser disagree about the objective,
    the simulator is measuring a design that was never proposed.

    Hidden tokens -- reasoning, tool-call JSON, anything a person never reads
    -- are worth their full rate, because every one of them is pure waiting.

    THE VISIBLE TERM IS THE WAIT AND NOT THE READING. Text a person reads as it
    arrives costs them the time it takes to read it no matter which lane wrote
    it: visible/ReadRate seconds, and NO ROUTER CAN REMOVE IT. What a router
    can remove is the part of the wait where the reader has caught up with the
    writer, which is the difference between the two rates and nothing else. A
    lane at or above the reading rate therefore contributes no visible wait at
    all, and two lanes above it are the SAME SPEED to the person.

    THE CORRECTION THIS FILE CARRIES. The objective used to end in
    `visible / min(rate, READ_RATE)`, which counts the reading. That term is a
    constant -- exactly `visible / READ_RATE` for a lane at or above the
    reading rate, and exactly the same constant on top of the catch-up for a
    lane below it -- so it changed no ranking anywhere. What it did was put a
    22.22-second block of reading into every `talk` number, and every RATIO
    taken from those numbers was then a ratio of mostly reading. The `talk`
    p90 that used to read as a 0.5% win over the strike ledger is a 5.9% win
    on the wait alone; the win over the router's default goes from 65.6% to
    96.3%. Neither policy moved. Only the arithmetic did.

# ── THE SHIP GATE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The gate has a speed half and a money half, and both are stated in the
# design's own terms rather than as numbers picked to look strict.
#
# THE MONEY HALF IS LAMBDA, NOT A PERCENTAGE. The gate used to demand "no more
# than 3% extra cost", and three percent is a number from nowhere: nobody in
# this design derived it and no scenario means anything by it. The design
# already carries a price for a second -- lambda, in seconds per dollar, chosen
# per scenario in Part II section 1 -- and a router that spends a dollar to buy
# more than lambda seconds has, by the design's own arithmetic, made a good
# trade. So the money clause IS that trade, per request:
#
#     delta_dollars_per_request  <=  delta(mean wait) / lambda
#
# At lambda = 0 -- off the critical path, nobody waiting -- the right-hand side
# is zero and the rule degenerates to "it must not cost more than the
# baseline", which is exactly what background work should demand. The mean and
# not the p90 is on the left of that division because lambda prices the seconds
# actually saved across the run, and a percentile is not a quantity you can
# divide by a rate and get dollars per request out of.
#
# THE SPEED HALF IS THE P90 OF WHAT THE SCENARIO ACTUALLY BUYS. For `work` and
# `offpath` that is the wait. For `talk` it is the FIRST TOKEN alone: above the
# reading rate every lane is the same speed to a person, so a talk turn's whole
# prize is the empty line before the stream starts, and gating it on the wait
# would grade the design partly on a term it has no way to move.
GATE_P90_IMPROVE = 0.30

# THE NAMED BASELINE IS THE MECHANISM THIS DESIGN PROPOSES TO RETIRE. Beating
# the router's own default is necessary and decides nothing, because nobody is
# proposing to keep the default. `openrouter-default` and `sheet-only` are
# graded against the same baseline as ordinary arms, so the table still shows
# what today's default and the prior-alone would cost.
