#   SKIP_GRADE    1 stops once the patch is collected — a rig dry run
#
# Writes results/<task>-<model>-<seed>/{run.log,do.json|door.json,graph.db,
# model.patch,reward.json,cost.json,meta.json,home/}. Every phase is recorded
# even when it fails, because the question a failed run has to answer is
# *which layer* broke.
#
# The harness runs INSIDE the task container (the binary is copied in), matching
# how the reference runner drives its own CLI. Two deliberate deviations from
# task.toml, both recorded because they affect comparability: the agent
# container has network access (an API-driven agent cannot honour
# `network_mode = "no-network"`), and the container is emulated when the host is
# not amd64. The verifier still runs with --network none, so grading is
# unaffected.
#
# THE TWO DOORS. `do` is the headless door: the brief on stdin, `-json`, the
# work model and the plan model pinned, `-yes-spend`, the task's wall as
# `-timeout`, and the exit code read off the ladder (0 done · 2 partial · 3 a
# limit · 4 asked). `chat` is the conversation a person sits in front of: the
# same binary in a real terminal (tmux on the host, `docker exec -it` into the
# container), `--yolo` so the tool gate never asks, `--one-model` so every seat
# is the pinned model, `--max-hours` set a minute inside the rig's wall and
# `--max-cost` at CHAT_CAP, and the brief pasted into the composer byte for
# byte. chat.sh says how the rig knows a conversation is finished. Everything
# after the door — the patch, the grade, the spend — is read the same way for
# both, so a difference in the table is a difference in the product.

# --- snapshot the rig, then run from the copy -------------------------------
# Bash reads a script by byte offset as it goes, so editing the rig while a run
# is in flight makes the running shell resume in the middle of the new text.
# Two ninety-minute runs were lost to exactly that: one resumed mid-heredoc
# (`line 145: is: command not found`), never extracted its patch and never
# graded; the other lost its container to a cleanup trap that fired out of
# sequence. So every run copies the rig into its own result directory before it
# does anything else — before lib.sh is even sourced, because a sourced file is
# read the same incremental way — and re-execs from that copy, which nothing

# Which worker actually did the work — one row of provenance beside every
# result, so a store can be read back years later without guessing.
#
# THE COLUMN IS nodes.ran, AND IT IS THE ONLY ONE THAT ANSWERS THIS QUESTION.
# nodes.subharness is what a stored graph ASKED for and is blank on the great
# majority of nodes — every node of the s9 ink and igel stores read blank, which
# is why that sweep's autopsy took a day. splice_subharness is what the subtree
# was admitted under, an intention and not a fact. nodes.ran is written by the
# dispatch path at the moment it builds the worker, and it names the worker out
# loud. A chat cell has no private store; its record is the journal under home/.
