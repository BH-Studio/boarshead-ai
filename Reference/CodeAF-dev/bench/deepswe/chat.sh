# The chat door for the DeepSWE rig: `codeaf chat --yolo` in a real terminal,
# INSIDE the task's own container, driven the way a person meets it — the brief
# pasted into the composer, enter, and then waiting.
#
# It is the sibling of the `do` door in run.sh, and the two are kept as alike as
# the surfaces allow: same container, same binary, same home layout under
# /bench/home, same brief byte for byte, same rig wall. What differs is what the
# product does with it, which is the whole measurement.
#
# THE TERMINAL IS ON THE HOST, THE PROCESS IS IN THE CONTAINER. tmux runs on the
# host and its window is `docker exec -it` into the task container, so the
# surface gets a real pty and the host can type at it and read its screen with
# the same send-keys/capture-pane the canary (bench/canary/lib/chat.sh) uses.
# The home stays inside the container rather than being bind-mounted, because a
# session host listens on a unix socket under the home and a socket on a macOS
# bind mount is not a thing every file-sharing backend allows. So the witnesses
# are read through `docker cp` on every poll: the journal under v3/ and the call
# log under logs/, copied out to <out>/home-live and read by journal.py there.
#
# THE WORK IS OVER WHEN THREE WITNESSES AGREE, exactly as the canary has it: the
# journal holds a non-aux `usage` seal (the turn ended), the screen says nothing
# is still being worked (status line idle AND no `N running` on the rail), and
# the call log has been quiet for CHAT_QUIET seconds. The call log's in-flight
# count is deliberately not a witness (see the canary's file for the two ways it
# lies). A quiet call log under a screen that still claims to be working for
# CHAT_STALL seconds is a stall; the rig's wall is the wall.
#
# A QUESTION IS NOT THE END OF THE CELL. `--yolo` opens the tool gate; it does
# not stop the steward from putting a card in front of the person ("needs your
# look", "[a] accept"). A person sitting in front of the chat would answer, and
# this rig is built to have one — a monitor watching the tmux session named in
# <out>/tmux-session.txt. So an asked frame is recorded (asked_s) and the cell
# waits CHAT_ASK_GRACE seconds for the monitor to answer before it ends as
# `asked`. Every answer a monitor gives is the monitor's to write down.
