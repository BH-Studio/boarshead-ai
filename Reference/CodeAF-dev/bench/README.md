# Benchmark harness

The protocol used to compare codeaf against pi and opencode on real issues in a
real repository. `run.sh` runs it; this file explains why each step is there and
which numbers it is honest to quote.

Measured results are in [`../BENCHMARKS.md`](../BENCHMARKS.md).

## Shape

The unit is a **cell**: one harness, one issue, one clone. The grid is every
harness crossed with every issue in `ISSUES`.

Each cell runs:

1. **Fresh shallow clone.** Every cell starts from the same commit in a
   directory of its own. Reusing a checkout leaks the previous harness's diff
   into the next harness's starting state, which flatters whoever runs second.
2. **venv and test install.** `python3 -m venv`, then the repository's own dev
   extras, falling back to `requirements.txt` and finally bare `pytest`. This
   happens *before* the harness runs so that no harness spends part of its wall
   clock on environment setup that another harness got for free.
3. **One harness invocation** with the issue text as the whole instruction. All
   three harnesses receive the same text, fetched from GitHub with `gh issue
   view`. The only difference between cells is who executes it.
4. **Changed-file count**, from `git status --porcelain`. A harness that
   finishes having changed zero files did nothing, whatever its log narrates.
5. **Full-suite pytest**, run after the harness has stopped. Its counts, not the
   harness's self-assessment, are the verdict. The prompt tells the harness not
   to weaken tests; the diff is there to check whether it obeyed.

Everything is kept: the harness log, the pytest log, the base commit, the
completed graph, the kept store where there is one, and a CSV row per cell in
`results.csv`.

## The CSV

```
harness,issue,seconds,exit,changed_files,passed,failed,cost_usd,cost_source,codeaf_mode,nodes_failed
```

Columns are **appended, not inserted**. A CSV written before one existed is
still a valid CSV, and a reader that indexed the first nine columns by position
still reads the same nine things. Old rows simply have no value for the later
ones; read a missing `codeaf_mode` as `node`, which is what every recorded
codeaf row was.

There used to be a `subharness_chosen` column. It went in #227, along with the
last thing that could have chosen: every leaf runs the one worker, so the column
had one value and measured nothing. Old rows still carry it and still parse.

- `codeaf_mode` — the shape the cell ran in (below). `n/a` for pi and opencode,
  which have one shape and no name for it.
- `nodes_failed` — failed nodes counted out of `done.json`, because the exit
  code is not the verdict: a smoke run watched the engine crash inside its
  leaf while `run` exited 0, over a suite that was green before the harness
  arrived. A row with `nodes_failed > 0` is a DNF whatever its other columns
  say. `n/a` for pi and opencode, and for `do` and `chat` (no `done.json` to
  read).

## Cost: harness self-reporting only

**The cost column is filled in from the harness's own reported usage, never from
an account-level credit delta.** For codeaf that is the `$` figure on the run
summary line, which comes from the provider's per-response usage accounting
summed over the run.

That one line is the source in every codeaf graph shape and the script parses it
the same way in each. `codeaf run` ends with it; `codeaf do` ends with
`<elapsed> · <n> nodes · $<spend>`, which is the same accounting through a
different mouth. Every leaf's spend lands in its `Outcome.Usage` and is summed
into that figure. The shared-key law holds in every shape: self-reported or
nothing.

This is not a stylistic preference. The API key used for these runs is shared,
and account-level deltas measured across a benchmark window included up to $116
of unrelated and runaway traffic that had nothing to do with the cell being
timed. Any protocol that subtracts two credit readings around a run is measuring
that traffic too. On a shared key the delta is not a noisy version of the right
number — it is a different number.

The consequence is that **pi and opencode have no cost figure here.** Neither
self-reports usage, so on a shared key their cost is not measurable at all. It
becomes measurable only on a key isolated to a single run, and until someone
does that, comparing codeaf's self-reported dollars to a pi or opencode credit
delta compares two different quantities. `results.csv` records this explicitly:
the `cost_source` column reads `self-reported` or `not-self-reported`, and the
`cost_usd` column is `n/a` in the latter case rather than a guess.

## codeaf invocation

Four shapes, selected with `CODEAF_MODE`, against the same recorded pi and
opencode rows.

- `node` (default) — the one-node graph in `graphs/issue.json`, rendered with
  the issue text as the leaf's brief. This measures the executor alone: one
  agent, one leaf, no planning call. It is the shape quoted in the issue matrix,
  because it is the like-for-like comparison against pi and opencode, which are
  also single agents.
- `do` — `codeaf do "<issue text>"` with no graph written for it. The compiler
  decides how the work is shaped and that shape is what gets measured. This
  mode was called `select` until #227, for the worker it also chose; there is
  one worker now, so the shape is the whole of what it still decides.
- `pipeline` — `codeaf plan --brief` first, then `codeaf run` over the resulting
  graph. This is the parallel shape and is what the PR-review comparison used.
- `chat` — `codeaf chat --once "<issue text>" --yolo --one-model`. The chat
  surface's brain, one turn, nobody watching.

The workspace is the clone itself (`-w` in every shape, including `do`'s), so
the agent's writes are the diff being measured — except `chat`, which has no
`-w` and takes the process's directory, so that one shape is run from inside
the clone.

### The `chat` shape is answering a different question

The other three modes are ways of running an *errand*. `chat` is one
conversational **turn**: no graph is compiled, so there is no delivery gate, no
replan and no `done.json`. Structurally it is closest to `node` — one agent, one
invocation — and it is the row to quote when the question is "what would a
person typing this into chat have got?", not "how well does the compiler
decompose this?".

Three things about the cell are the command's shape rather than a choice:

- **`--yolo` is not optional.** Nobody is watching, so consent is refused rather
  than assumed, and a cell without it changes zero files while looking healthy.
- **`--one-model` is not optional either, and this is the subtle one.** A chat
  session resolves its auxiliary calls — titles, safety, compaction, the check
  on finished work — through the crew rows and role pins in the operator's
  `/settings`. `-model` alone therefore measures *that machine's profile* as
  much as the named model: on one trivial task, 22% of the spend went to a
  model the run never named. `--one-model` settles every text call on the
  session model for that run without writing any setting.
- **`CODEAF_HOME` is set per cell.** Chat keeps its state in the shared home;
  four parallel cells sharing one would be four writers on one store, and the
  cells would leak into each other and into the operator's own history.

Its cost is not read from a summary line, because `--once` does not print one —
it ends with the reply. The spend is summed from the `usage` records in the
cell's own session transcript, one per model, **including the ones marked
`aux`**: those are exactly the calls `--one-model` exists to make legible, and
a reader that skips them under-reports.

Substitution into the graph template goes through `python3` rather than `sed`:
issue bodies contain quotes and newlines that would otherwise produce a graph
file that does not parse.

### The comparison doctrine

The shapes answer different questions and only make sense read together:

- **`node` is the drift control.** It is the recorded configuration, unchanged.
  If a `node` re-run does not land near the numbers in `../BENCHMARKS.md`, the
  harness moved, and every other row in the same grid is suspect until that is
  explained. It is measured first for that reason and not because it is
  expected to win.
- **`do` is the shipping claim.** It is the only row that reflects what a person
  actually gets, because it is the only one where nobody wrote the graph for the
  compiler. `codeaf do --keep` leaves its private store beside the cell, which is
  where a run's own record of which models served it is legible.
- **`pipeline` is the decomposition claim.** It answers what planning the work
  first buys over taking it in one leaf, on the same issue and the same clone.

**pi and opencode are the bar**, not the baseline. Their recorded rows in
`../BENCHMARKS.md` are what any codeaf shape has to beat to have shown anything.

## pi and opencode invocation

`PI_BIN`/`OPENCODE_BIN` and their flags are variables at the top of `run.sh`.
Both CLIs move their flags between versions. If a cell comes back with a zero
exit and zero changed files, check the invocation against the installed version
before concluding the harness failed the task — that failure mode looks
identical to a real DNF in the CSV and only the harness log tells them apart.

## Timeouts

`CELL_TIMEOUT` (default 40m) caps each harness invocation. It is a spend
backstop, not a work limit: a harness still running at the cap has produced no
diff and is recorded as a DNF, and on a metered key leaving it running is how a
benchmark run becomes an unrelated bill.

The cap is one cap. `codeaf do` carries its own wall in seconds and defaults to
fifteen minutes, so `do` cells are given `-timeout` converted from
`CELL_TIMEOUT`: a shape held to a quarter of the time the others get is not the
same cell.

## The dry run

```sh
CODEAF_MODE=node ISSUES=21 HARNESSES=codeaf bench/run.sh --dry-run
```

`--dry-run` (or `BENCH_DRY_RUN=1`) composes every invocation and executes none
of them. It clones nothing, builds no venv, calls no model, and prints the exact
argv the real run would launch — plus, for the graph shapes, the rendered graph.
It is the check for the failure that costs the most to find any other way: a
flag that moved between versions, whose first evidence is a grid of zero-file
cells and a bill.

The one thing it still reaches out for is `gh issue view`, because the issue
text is an input to the composition. If that fails it composes with a stand-in
of the same shape and says so, so the wiring can be checked offline.

## Running it

```sh
REPO=https://github.com/MALIBA-AI/bambara-text-normalization \
MODEL=deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731 \
ISSUES="20 21 22 23" \
HARNESSES="codeaf pi opencode" \
CODEAF_MODE=node \
BASE_COMMIT=6c978ffa1c49ba600c85eb893958409e37dbedd2 \
bench/run.sh
```

The codeaf comparison is one run of that per `CODEAF_MODE`, each writing its
own `results.csv`.

Two lines of that invocation are load-bearing honesty:

- **`BASE_COMMIT` pins every clone to 2026-08-02** — the last commit with all
  four issues still open. The repository has since merged fixes for #23
  (2026-08-06) and #21 (2026-08-08), so an unpinned clone passes the suite
  before any harness runs and every row on it measures nothing. The recorded
  pi/opencode rows predate those merges; only pinned reruns are comparable to
  them, and even then suite drift means within-row comparison beats
  cross-table comparison.
- **`MODEL` is passed to codeaf as `-model` on every invocation** (run, plan,
  do), because the CLI flag is the only rung that outranks the picker
  preference in `~/.codeaf/settings.json` — an env var does not. The smoke run
  found this the honest way: settings resolved to a `-latest` alias the
  engine's catalog rejected, and the cell died at $0 while claiming exit 0.

Requires `git`, `python3`, `gh` (authenticated), and `timeout` (`gtimeout` from
coreutils on macOS is picked up automatically). `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` must be set
for codeaf — the script exports what the shell already has rather than defining
a key of its own, and says so early when there is nothing to export. The other
harnesses need whatever their own configuration expects.

## What this protocol does not establish

One repository, one model, one attempt per cell. Test-count deltas measure
whether a change works against a suite that already existed; they say nothing
about whether the change is the one a maintainer would have written. Read the
caveats section of `../BENCHMARKS.md` before generalising from any of it.
