"""Pick real GitHub issues whose fix is graded by tests the fix itself shipped.

The canary needs tasks a person would actually paste into a coding assistant,
each small enough to finish in a few minutes, and each with an outcome a script
can check without a model's opinion. Closed issues that were closed by a merged
pull request carrying tests give exactly that: the pull request's tests fail on
the commit before the fix and pass after it, so a candidate solution is graded
by running them.

Every pick is validated offline before it is admitted: the repository is
cloned, the base commit checked out, the tests installed, and the three facts a
grade depends on are measured rather than assumed — the fix's tests fail at
base, the pre-existing tests pass at base, and the fix itself turns the tests
green. A candidate that fails any of these is dropped with the reason printed;
nothing is admitted on the strength of its metadata.

Usage:
  pick.py --anchors 3                                 write frozen anchors into pool.json
  pick.py --fresh 2 --exclude pool.json --out f.json  fresh picks for one run
  pick.py --dry-run                                   list candidates and reasons, no clones
  pick.py --seed 7 ...                                reproducible candidate order
  pick.py --remeasure owner/repo [owner/repo ...]     re-measure those entries' base in pool.json

Only the standard library is used; `gh`, `git` and `python3 -m venv` are
shelled out to. Nothing is pushed, opened or commented anywhere: repositories
are cloned, measured and deleted.
