#
# THE WORK IS OVER WHEN THREE WITNESSES AGREE. The journal says the turn ended
# (a non-aux `usage` row, internal/session's seal); the screen says nothing is
# still being worked — the status line reads idle AND the rail shows no task
# running, because a reply may end by handing the issue to a task that works on
# after the seal; and the call log has been quiet for a moment. The call log's
# own in-flight count is deliberately NOT a witness, because it is wrong in
# both directions: a start row can be left with no end row by a logging fault
# alone (#334 dropped the row on a +Inf figure, fixed by #357), and a handoff
# refused before the wire writes no row at all (#443: no model for the role
# under --one-model, so nothing was ever sent). A rule that waited on that
# count would wait until the wall. A call log quiet for STALL seconds while
# something on the screen still claims to be working is a stall, and the wall
# is the wall.
#
# Every rig is named by its own pid and cell so that several cells, and several
# sessions of this rig on one box, never reach each other's tmux sessions — and
# every target is spelled `=name`, because a bare -t prefix-matches, with a
# trailing colon added wherever tmux wants a pane rather than a session.
