"""Turn a run's cell records into the scoreboard: a table for people, a CSV for
machines, and a comparison against the baseline when there is one.

TWO VERDICTS, NEVER ONE. Every row carries what the DOOR said about its own run
and, separately, what the pull request's TESTS said about the tree that door
left. A door that refuses work the tests call green is a defect of this product,
and folding the two into a single pass/fail is exactly how such a defect hides.
`pass` is their conjunction and is kept for the comparison against a baseline,
not for reading.

The same rows go to three places — the terminal, `rows.csv` beside the cells,
and the tracking issue with `--post` — so nobody can quote a number the file
does not carry. A regression is a judgement about ANCHORS only: a fresh pick
that fails on both doors is first a bad pick, and one that fails on one door is
a finding to read, not a red row to revert on.
