# canary_home writes the whole state root one cell runs in.
#
# EVERY CELL IS ITS OWN MACHINE. CODEAF_HOME moves the state root wholesale
# (internal/home), so a directory of its own gives a cell its own journal, its
# own call log, its own budget and its own first-run history, and nothing a
# previous cell learned or spent can reach the next one.
#
# ONLY THE KEY IS CARRIED OVER from the person's own profile. Every other row is
# written here, because the rows are the pin: the talk model, all four tiers and
# the approval posture name the one model under test, so a cell cannot quietly
# route a call through whatever this machine's /settings happen to hold. The
# daily budget is the cell's own spend ceiling — a day inside a fresh home is
# exactly one run — and the setup marker is written so the first-run screen,
# which would otherwise sit in front of the composer waiting for a person, is
# never drawn.
