# pass/fail is exactly where such a defect would hide. `pass` below is their
# conjunction, and stays the thing a regression is measured on.
# THE VERDICT COLUMN READS THE DOOR'S OWN LADDER. `codeaf do` ends on five
# exit codes and each one is a different finding, so the rig reads the code
# rather than inferring the finding from the record the door left behind:
#   0  done — it finished the work and said so

#   4  it needed a person, and stopped to ask
# Rung 3 splits in two, because a clock running out and a budget refusing to
# spend are different defects: it reads `wall` when the rig's own wall is what
# fired and `limit` otherwise. `chat` has no such ladder and is read from its
# record exactly as it always was, and so is any code that is not on the ladder
