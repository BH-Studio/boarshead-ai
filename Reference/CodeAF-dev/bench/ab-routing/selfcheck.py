"""Validate every task and grader before a cent is spent.

Both Phase A labs ran a check like this and between them it caught 26 defects
in ground truth -- wrong expected answers, infeasible tasks, graders that
accepted a near-miss. Every one of those would have surfaced later as "the
models are weak" and been unfalsifiable after the fact.

What is checked here, per task:

  * a **reference solution** exists and scores full marks. If the reference
    cannot pass, a model failure says nothing about the model.
  * an **empty or unattempted workspace** scores zero, and does so through the
    gate rather than by accident.
  * **near-miss decoys** are rejected. This is the check that catches a grader
    which is really just testing whether a file exists: for each field, a
    submission that is correct everywhere except that field must lose exactly
    that field.
  * for T2, the answer key is **re-derived from the corpus text** rather than
    trusted. truth.py holds transcribed numbers; if a transcription and the
    document disagree, the document wins and this fails.

Exit status is 0 only if everything passes.

## Deprecated queue technologies (doc 06)

doc 06 (ADR-0011) supersedes doc 05 (ADR-0007) in full and deprecates
kafka-shared alongside rabbit-legacy, leaving pulsar-edge as the only current
technology. Reading doc 05 alone gives the wrong answer. On that basis the
services on a deprecated queue are {services} — every service in doc 01 except
the one already on pulsar-edge.

## Incidents (doc 02, doc 03, doc 04)

Total customer impact across the three reports is
{key['total_incident_minutes']} minutes. doc 02 states its window in words,
doc 03 gives clock times, and doc 04 runs from 22:40 on one day to 01:25 on the
next, crossing midnight UTC. The most impacted service is
{key['most_impacted_service']}, which appears in two of the three reports.

## Cost (doc 08)

Under the schedule in doc 08, effective 2026-03-01, the monthly bill for the
whole catalog is {key['monthly_cost_usd_cents']} cents. doc 07 is the earlier
schedule and is superseded on its whole contents by rule 4 of RULES.md, so its
higher rabbit and kafka rates do not apply.

## Ownership (doc 01)

{unowned} have no owner. doc 01 records both as vacant with the owning team
dissolved or departed.

## Supersession and contradictions

Superseded documents: doc 05, superseded explicitly by doc 06; and doc 07,
superseded by doc 08 under rule 4.

Three contradictions, each decided by RULES.md:

- doc 03 states that svc-search publishes through pulsar-edge. doc 01 owns
  service metadata under rule 1, and records kafka-shared. doc 01 wins; this is
  a contradiction on queue_client. It matters, because believing doc 03 would
  drop svc-search from the deprecated list.
- doc 09 puts the 2026-01-14 auth impact at about 90 minutes. doc 02 owns
  incident facts under rule 2 and states 3 hours 40 minutes. doc 02 wins; a
  contradiction on incident_duration_minutes.
- doc 09 asserts that team-platform owns svc-notify. doc 01 owns service
  metadata under rule 1 and records the ownership as vacant. Operational
  coverage is not ownership. doc 01 wins; a contradiction on owner.

On-call notes are never authoritative under rule 5, which is what decides two
of the three. Nothing in this audit conflicts with anything outside the corpus,
and no finding here rests on a document that has been superseded.
