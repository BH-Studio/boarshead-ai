"""Did the router's decisions shift between run 1 and run 3?

This is the continual-learning check from DESIGN.md §6, rewritten against the
router's actual event log now that it exists. `router-events.jsonl` is richer
than the profile-file-set fallback the design planned for, and one field is the
reason: **`candidates`** is the ordered rung list the choice was made from. Both
Phase A labs had to reconstruct what a router *would* have done from an offline
matrix and neither could recover the counterfactual. Here it is recorded, so
"the router changed its mind" is a diff rather than an inference.

Five measurements, in increasing order of how much they would mean:

  1  **ledger growth** — did the shared ledger accumulate at all? A learning
     claim over three runs that left it byte-identical is a plumbing bug
     wearing a null result, and this catches it before anything else.
  2  **rung order** — the `candidates` list per call class, run 1 vs run 3.
     This is the decision the ledger exists to move.
  3  **who opened the call** — the rung-0 model per class, and each model's
     share of attempts.
  4  **escalation and verdicts** — how often the cascade fired, and how calls
     ended.
  5  **outcome at constant task** — score, cost and turns for the same task in
     run 1 vs run 3. Learning that moves none of them is bookkeeping.

The fresh-ledger control is what separates learning from run-to-run variance:
codeaf samples the spine three times and leaf order varies, so a run-1/run-3
difference means nothing on its own. Without a control this script says so
rather than implying a result it cannot support.
