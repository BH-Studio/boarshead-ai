# Arm A only: run the three replicates as three concurrent streams.
#
# Why this exists. run-arm.sh runs every cell in sequence, which arm B needs
# because its ledger has to carry forward in a defined order. Arm A does not:
# DESIGN.md §5 gives every arm-A cell its own fresh profile directory precisely
# so the replicates are independent, and independent cells can run at the same
# time. Each stream still does its three tasks in order, so nothing inside a
# replicate is reordered.
#
# What this costs, stated plainly: wall clock is then measured under three-way
# self-contention and is NOT comparable to a sequential arm B. The uncontended
# per-cell timings come from the calibration round, which ran one cell at a
# time, and those are the figures BASELINE.md quotes for latency. Success rate,
# score, cost and token counts are unaffected by contention and are what this
# script is for.
