# The prompt-diet parity bench

What this measures: whether a build with a smaller prefix **does the same things**
as the build before it, and how many prompt tokens per turn it pays to do them.

The owner's acceptance for the whole wave, in their own words: *"real e2e with
dev and our branch, same other changes, just this diff alone, and see if we are
on parity but efficient."* That is two claims, and they are decided separately:

| claim | decided by | what would sink it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **parity** | every subtest and every cell ends equal or better | one subtest that passed on `dev` and fails on the diet |
| **efficiency** | median prompt tokens per **turn** | a page that got shorter while the conversation got longer |

`docs/design/prompt-diet/BENCH.md` is the report: the recipes, the baseline
table, what is not covered and why. This file says what the scripts are.

**It spends real money and is on demand.** Nothing here is wired into `make
check` and nothing here may be. Layer A is free and is worth running while
editing; layers B, C and D call a real model.

## The four layers

| layer | what it is | costs | proves |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **A** prefix | `TestTheFixedPrefixStaysUnderItsBudget`, run with `-v` and its one logged line read back | nothing | the static bill, exactly: page bytes and tool-block bytes |
| **B** suites | `TestTUIE2E`, `TestQuestionsE2E`, `TestStandingE2E` — the real binary, a real terminal, a real model | ~20 min, cents | **parity**, which is what these are for |
| **C** cells | `bench/conversation` scenarios and `bench/e2e` cells, unchanged, handed this build's binary | minutes, cents | outcome and cost on ordinary work |
| **D** wire | the per-request ledger, rolled up out of what layers B and C already wrote | nothing extra | **efficiency**: tokens per turn |

Layer D stands up no new proxy. `bench/conversation/lib/guard.py` is already a
loopback forwarder every cell runs in front of OpenRouter — handed to the
harness as `CODEAF_BASE_URL` with a sentinel key — and it already writes an
admitted row carrying the request's shape and a settled row carrying what the
provider said it charged. `internal/calllog` is codeaf's own always-on record
and, with `CODEAF_CALL_LOG_BODIES=1`, is the only place the **tool block's own
bytes** can be counted per request. `lib/wire.py` normalises both into one
JSONL, keeping `source` on every row so the two are never added together.

## The rig is this checkout; the subject is the branch

`run.sh` builds `<branch>` in a worktree of its own and points every bench
script **from this checkout** at that binary. That is the only arrangement that
can compare two branches at all: `dev` at `6aa6a946e` has never heard of
`bench/prompt-diet`, so a run using the subject's own rig would have nothing to
run on the baseline side — and a rig that moved with the subject would be
comparing two harnesses rather than two prompts.

## Running it

Everything runs on a bench host. `~/.local/bin/go`, the key in a sourced
`secrets.env`, and `tmux` are all there.

```sh
bench/prompt-diet/run.sh 6aa6a946e dev --layers a         # free, seconds
bench/prompt-diet/run.sh 6aa6a946e dev                    # A + C + D
bench/prompt-diet/run.sh 6aa6a946e dev --layers a,b,c,d   # everything, ~40 min
bench/prompt-diet/run.sh prompt-diet/integrate diet --layers a,b,c,d
bench/prompt-diet/compare.py dev diet
bench/prompt-diet/prefixdiff.py ~/bench-diet-out/dev ~/bench-diet-out/diet
```

`prefixdiff.py` is free and reads only what a run already wrote. It answers the
question `compare.py` cannot — a cached share is an OUTCOME, and a share that
fell because the prefix moved wants the opposite response from one that fell
because the run made fewer, shorter conversations. It needs request bodies, so
the run must have set `CODEAF_CALL_LOG_BODIES=1`, which `run.sh` does. BENCH.md
§1c is the worked example and the finding it convicted.

`compare.py` exits non-zero when an outcome got worse, so it is usable as a
gate.

**Evidence lands OUTSIDE the checkout**, at `~/bench-diet-out/<label>/` by
default (`DIET_OUT_ROOT` or `--out`), and the build goes to a second root at
`~/bench-diet-build/<label>` (`DIET_BUILD_ROOT`). That is a correctness rule and
not tidiness: a cell's scratch workspace sits inside the evidence tree, and the
first baseline run put it inside the rig's own git checkout — whereupon the
`code-fix` cell's model walked up out of its two-file fixture, found the codeaf
repository around it, and ran `go test ./...` on a shared box. `run.sh` now
refuses an `--out` inside a checkout.

```
<out-root>/<label>/meta.json                       label, revision, model, layers, clock
<out-root>/<label>/prefix.log               layer A, whole
<out-root>/<label>/suites/<suite>.log       layer B, whole — the screens are too wide to pipe
<out-root>/<label>/suites/outcomes.json     one word per subtest
<out-root>/<label>/cells/conversation/…     bench/conversation's own evidence tree
<out-root>/<label>/cells/e2e.csv            bench/e2e's append-only row per cell
<out-root>/<label>/wire.jsonl               one normalised row per request
<out-root>/<label>/summary.md               one page about this run alone
```

### Knobs

| flag | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--layers` | `a,c,d` | which layers to run |
| `--model` | `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731` | the catalog id every cell is pinned to — see BENCH.md §1 on why not `v4.1-flash` |
| `--scenarios` | `research-brief,code-fix,followup-while-working,work-result-recalled` | `bench/conversation` scenarios, or `none` |
| `--cells` | `lookup,bundle3` | `bench/e2e` cells, or `none` |
| `--suites` | `TestTUIE2E,TestQuestionsE2E,TestStandingE2E` | layer B, or `none` |
| `--allowlist` | — | extra ids the run may legitimately have billed (a fallback model) |
| `--out` | `~/bench-diet-out/<label>` | where evidence lands; must be outside every checkout |
| `--keep-worktree` | off | leave the build for a follow-up run |
| `--dry-run` | off | compose everything, spend nothing |

**`TestTUIE2E` pins its own model** — `e2eModel` in
`internal/e2e/harness_test.go` is the constant `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`, not
this bench's `--model`. That is fine and deliberate: both sides of a comparison
run the same constant, so the comparison is fair. It does mean layer B and layer
C are not on the same model, and the tables say which is which.

## The ablation

`ablate.sh <branch> <unit-id>` renders the page with one law unit removed and
runs the cell set without it. `units.tsv` is the list and says, for each unit,
where it lives and whether a substring test pins it. **It is prepared, not run**
— BENCH.md §5 says what it would cost and what it could and could not settle.

## Files

| file | what it is |
| --- | --- |
| `run.sh` | one branch's whole measurement, four layers |
| `compare.py` | two labels side by side, and the parity/efficiency ruling |
| `prefixdiff.py` | one run's request bodies: where the cached prefix broke, and what broke it |
| `ablate.sh` | one law unit removed, then the cells |
| `units.tsv` | the law units, largest first, with their key sentences |
| `lib/outcomes.py` | `go test -v` logs → one word per subtest |
| `lib/wire.py` | the guard's ledger and the call log → one row per request |
| `lib/summary.py` | one page about one run |
