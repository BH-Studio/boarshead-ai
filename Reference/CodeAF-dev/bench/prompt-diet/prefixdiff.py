"""prefixdiff.py — where the cached prefix broke, and what broke it.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `compare.py` reports what the provider CHARGED, and the first
dev→diet run said the median cached share fell from about 91% to about 69%
(BENCH.md §1a). A charge is an outcome and not a cause: a cached share can fall
because the prefix genuinely moved, or because the mix of requests changed —
nineteen turn-requests instead of sixty-nine means a larger fraction of them are
turn-OPENERS, whose tail necessarily differs from the round before it. Those two
want opposite responses, and nothing already in this bench can tell them apart.

So this reads the REQUEST BODIES and answers the question directly: for every
request, how many leading bytes did it share with the request before it in the
same conversation, and — when the answer is "not all of them" — which block,
which field, and which sixty bytes.

WHAT IT COMPARES, AND IN WHAT ORDER. A provider caches on the leading bytes of
the prompt IT assembles, which is not the order of the JSON body it was handed.
Two families, and the body says which:

  Anthropic     top-level `tools`, then top-level `system`, then `messages`.
                Cached behind explicit `cache_control` markers.
  OpenAI-style  one `messages` array with the system message at index 0, and
  (OpenRouter,  `tools` in the body. DeepSeek and most of what OpenRouter fronts
   DeepSeek)    cache automatically on the leading prompt in 64-token blocks.

Both are serialised here as [tools][system][messages], which is the Anthropic
order exactly and the conservative reading of the other: whatever the server
does with the tool block, a client that keeps tools AND system AND the head of
the transcript byte-stable is stable under either assembly. A run where the
tool block moves and nothing else will say so on its own row, so the two causes
are never confused even if a given server happens to forgive one of them.

WHAT COUNTS AS "the request before it". Requests are grouped into sessions by
the conversation they belong to — the log file they were written to, the task
node, and the opening human message — and ordered by their timestamp. A request
whose predecessor is in another conversation has no comparison and is reported
as an opener rather than as a miss, because a first request cannot break a cache
that does not exist yet.

Usage:
    prefixdiff.py <run-dir> [<run-dir> …]      one table per run, then the roll-up
    prefixdiff.py <run-dir> --jsonl rows.jsonl one row per request, machine-readable
    prefixdiff.py <run-dir> --all              asides too, not just belt-carrying turns

`<run-dir>` is a `run.sh` evidence tree (`~/bench-diet-out/<label>/`). Only the
call log can answer this: the guard deliberately keeps no bodies, so the run
must have been made with CODEAF_CALL_LOG_BODIES=1, which `run.sh` sets.
