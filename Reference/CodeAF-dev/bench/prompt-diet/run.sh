#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run.sh — one branch's whole parity measurement, in four layers.
#
# THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS is the owner's acceptance for the prompt-diet wave,
# in their own words: "real e2e with dev and our branch, same other changes,
# just this diff alone, and see if we are on parity but efficient". Parity is an
# OUTCOME claim — every subtest and every cell ends the same way or better — and
# efficiency is a TOKEN claim: fewer prompt tokens per turn for that same
# outcome. A byte count alone proves neither, which is why this exists at all
# (docs/design/prompt-diet/DESIGN.md §6, "Proof is the bench, not the byte
# count").
#
# THE RIG IS THIS CHECKOUT; THE SUBJECT IS THE BRANCH. The bench scripts, the
# scenario texts and the assertions all come from the checkout this file lives
# in, and only `bin/codeaf` and the Go sources under test come from <branch>.
# That is deliberate and it is the only arrangement that can compare two
# branches at all: `dev` at 6aa6a946e has never heard of bench/prompt-diet, so a
# run that used the subject's own rig would have nothing to run on the baseline
# side — and a rig that moved with the subject would be measuring two harnesses
# rather than two prompts.
#
# IT RUNS ON THE BENCH HOST. Layer B alone is seventeen minutes of a real binary in a
# real terminal against a real model, and the full suite is not meant to run on a
# work machine. Nothing here refuses to run elsewhere — a
# refusal keyed off a hostname would be a lie on the next machine — but every
# recipe in docs/design/prompt-diet/BENCH.md is spelled for `ssh benchhost`.
#
# IT SPENDS REAL MONEY. Layers B and C call a real model. Layer A does not, and
# is worth running on its own while editing.

# Usage:

#   bench/prompt-diet/run.sh prompt-diet/integrate diet        # the other side
#
# Options:
#   --layers a,b,c,d   which layers to run (default: a,c,d)
#   --model <id>       the catalog id every cell is pinned to
#   --scenarios <list> conversation scenarios (comma-separated, or "none")
#   --cells <list>     bench/e2e cells (comma-separated, or "none")
#   --suites <list>    tagged Go suites for layer B (comma-separated, or "none")
#   --out <dir>        where evidence lands (default ~/bench-diet-out/<label>, and
#                      it must be outside every checkout — see the note below)
#   --allowlist <ids>  extra catalog ids the run may legitimately have billed
#   --keep-worktree    leave the built worktree behind for a follow-up run
#   --reuse-worktree   build into an existing worktree instead of creating one
#   --dry-run          compose everything, spend nothing

#
# A  prefix   the static bill: `prompt + tools` bytes from the budget test.
#             Free, offline, and the only layer that is exact rather than
#             sampled — the wire's own prompt_tokens carry the transcript too.
# B  suites   the tagged Go suites that drive the real binary against a real
#             model. This is where PARITY is decided: a subtest that passed on
#             dev and fails on the diet is the whole answer, whatever the token
#             column says.
# C  cells    the existing bench batteries — bench/conversation (a conversation
#             turn, a handoff, work recalled) and bench/e2e (a task shape end to
#             end). These carry their own verdicts, costs and token counts.
# D  wire     the per-request ledger, rolled up from the guard's own usage file
#             (bench/conversation/lib/guard.py, which every cell already stands
#             in front of OpenRouter) and from codeaf's built-in call log.

# THE PIN IS THE ONE THE BATTERIES WERE CALIBRATED ON, and it is not the one
# this wave started with.
#
# MEASURED on a bench host, 2026-09-10. Pinned to `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash`,
# cells died mid-turn with the provider's own sentence: "0 endpoints out of 1
# requested are available matching your guardrail restrictions and data policy
# … Paid model training violation (account settings): 1 endpoint excluded". It
# is intermittent and it is not codeaf's fault twice over — the id is real and a
# bare curl to it answered three times out of three, from GMICloud and DeepInfra
# — but codeaf asks for ONE endpoint per request and takes no fallback, so an
# endpoint this account's privacy settings exclude is a dead turn rather than a
# hop. It failed `research-brief`, which had passed twice, and `code-fix`, on
# the same afternoon, on the same build. A parity ruling cannot be made through
# that: the noise is bigger than the effect being measured.
#
# `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731` is the same family, is what every historical
# row in `bench/conversation` and `bench/e2e` was measured on, and its endpoints
# are ones this account allows. Comparability with that history is worth having
# anyway. DIET_MODEL or --model moves it; BENCH.md §1 carries the finding.
