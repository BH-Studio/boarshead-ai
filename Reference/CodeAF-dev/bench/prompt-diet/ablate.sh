# ablate.sh — remove ONE law unit from the page and run the cells without it.
#
# PREPARED, NOT YET RUN. Nothing in this wave's evidence comes from this file
# yet; it exists so that the arbiter DESIGN.md §3 calls for ("ablation as the
# arbiter") is a script somebody can start rather than a paragraph somebody has
# to re-derive. Read docs/design/prompt-diet/BENCH.md §5 before spending on it.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. Exactly one paragraph on the page has ever earned its place
# with evidence: the working discipline, on twelve unattended runs, 3/3 against
# 0/5. Every other law is there because somebody believed it helped. An ablation
# is the only instrument that can tell the two apart — render the page with one
# unit missing, run the same cells, and see whether the outcome moves. What does
# not move is not deleted; it is refiled as ON DEMAND, which is the diet's whole
# thesis.
#
# IT DOES NOT DECIDE ANYTHING ON ITS OWN. A cell set this size cannot separate a
# real effect from the model's own variance in one run, and a pinned law does
# not move on one run's evidence whatever it says (the brief's list, and
# DESIGN.md §6). Treat a moved outcome as a reason to run that unit again with
# more seeds, never as a verdict.
#
# TWO ROADS TO REMOVING A UNIT, and it takes whichever exists:
#
#   the env    CODEAF_PROMPT_ABLATE=<id> — a hook lane C or lane G may add to
#              the law registry, which drops one registered unit from the
#              rendered page and leaves everything else byte-identical. This is
#              the honest road: the unit is removed by the same code that puts
#              it there, so no neighbouring byte moves.
#   the patch  failing that, the unit's key sentence is cut out of a THROWAWAY
#              worktree's `internal/session/prompts/system.md` with python, and
#              the binary is rebuilt from it. Cruder — a cut can take a heading
#              or a blank line with it — but it needs nothing from another lane.
#
# The script asks the binary which road it is on and says so in the row. A run
# that silently fell back to patching when the caller expected the env hook
# would be comparing two different experiments under one name.
#
# Usage:
#   bench/prompt-diet/ablate.sh <branch> <unit-id> [options]
#   bench/prompt-diet/ablate.sh prompt-diet/integrate media-essay --dry-run
#
# Options are run.sh's, and are passed through unchanged.
