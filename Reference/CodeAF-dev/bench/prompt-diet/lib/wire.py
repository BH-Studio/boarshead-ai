"""wire.py — one normalised row per model request, from the two records that
already exist. Nothing here stands up a new proxy.

TWO SOURCES, AND THEY MEASURE DIFFERENT THINGS.

  the guard   `bench/conversation/lib/guard.py` is a loopback forwarder every
              conversation cell already runs in front of OpenRouter, handed to
              the harness as CODEAF_BASE_URL with a sentinel key. It writes
              `guard-usage.jsonl`: an `admitted` row carrying the request's
              SHAPE (bytes on the wire, message count, tool count) and a
              `settled` row carrying what the provider said it CHARGED
              (prompt_tokens, completion_tokens, prompt_tokens_details.
              cached_tokens, cost). It is arm-neutral — the same measurement for
              codeaf and for any peer — and it deliberately keeps no bodies.

  the call log `internal/calllog` is codeaf's own always-on record, pinned to a
              path with CODEAF_CALL_LOG. With CODEAF_CALL_LOG_BODIES=1 it keeps
              the whole request body, which is the only place the TOOL BLOCK's
              own bytes can be counted per request rather than inferred.

So the guard answers "what did this turn cost" for every arm, and the call log
answers "how much of it was the tool block" for the codeaf arm. A row from
either carries `source` saying which, and the two are never added together.

A call-log row also carries the PREFIX FINGERPRINTS — `system_bytes`,
`system_sha`, `tool_block_bytes`, `tools_sha`, `prefix_sha` — which are what a
byte-stability question is answered from: the same `prefix_sha` on every request
of a conversation is a prefix that stayed cacheable, and a new one per turn is
the frontier bill DESIGN.md §0 opens with. The whole body is NOT copied in here;
one run's bodies are sixteen megabytes and this file is meant to be read as a
table. `body_source` names the call log they are in, beside this file.

The exact static split — page bytes against tool-block bytes — is not sampled
here at all. It comes from layer A's budget test, which weighs the rendered page
and the marshalled belt directly and is the scoreboard the wave commits against.
