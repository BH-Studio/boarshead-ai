"""compare.py — two labelled runs, side by side, with a ruling.

THE RULING IS THE POINT, and it is two claims that are decided separately
because they can disagree:

  PARITY      every outcome is equal or better. A subtest that passed on the
              baseline and fails on the candidate sinks the whole wave whatever
              it saved; a cell that failed on both is not a regression; a
              subtest that passed where it used to fail is better. `skip` beside
              `pass` is NOT parity — a suite that stopped running is a suite
              that stopped proving anything — and `incomplete` on either side is
              never called equal, because a run that was cut off measured
              nothing about that test at all.

  EFFICIENCY  fewer prompt tokens per turn for that same outcome. Per TURN and
              not per run: a candidate that answers in three rounds where the
              baseline took six has a smaller bill and a bigger per-turn figure,
              and it is the per-turn figure that says whether the prefix got
              lighter. The round count is printed beside it so that the other
              reading is never hidden. And a TURN is a request that carried the
              tool block — see `Run.carries_the_belt`, which exists because the
              first comparison this bench ran reported a 94% cut that was a
              change of call mix and not a diet at all.

WHAT IS RECORDED RATHER THAN RULED ON: wall clock and dollars. `bench/e2e`'s own
README sets the thresholds this follows and the reason — two runs of IDENTICAL
code came in 15s and 24s, a 60% swing, because wall clock carries the provider's
queue as well as the work. A ruling on wall would report a regression every
other run and then nobody would read the table. Dollars move with cached share,
which moves with how the provider felt about the prefix that minute.

# The outcome vocabulary, worst to best. `incomplete` sits at the bottom because
# a test that never reported is less informative than one that reported badly.
#
# FAIL, TIMEOUT AND CRASH SHARE ONE RANK, and that is deliberate. It is tempting
# to score a cell that used to time out and now fails as an improvement — it
# finished, it cost less, it said something — and this bench met exactly that on
# its first real comparison: `followup-while-working` timed out at 423s on the
# baseline and failed its assertion at 112s on the candidate, for a fifth of the
# tokens. But neither of those is the cell passing, and ranking one above the
# other would let a genuine behaviour regression walk in wearing the word
# "better" because it got there faster. A move inside the not-a-pass band is
# SAME, and the token and wall columns beside it say what actually changed.
