"""Prime the Model Pool relay from the scored runs the seed index already holds.

This is a ONE-OFF. It is run once by the operator, over the private run ledgers
that never enter this repository, so that the first published index carries the
same cells the binary's embedded seed (internal/pool/index/seed.json) encodes.
Run it with --dry-run first: that prints the rows and checks them against the
seed without sending anything.

It reads two newline-delimited JSON ledgers by path, rebuilds the ordinary Model
Pool rows the seat/score mapping implies, groups them per install and day, and
either prints the NDJSON (--dry-run) or POSTs each batch to <relay>/v1/rows.

The ledgers stay outside the repository: pass their paths in on the command
line, and nothing here writes them back out.
