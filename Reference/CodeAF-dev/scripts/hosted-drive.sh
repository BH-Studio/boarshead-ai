#!/bin/bash
# hosted-drive.sh drives a run on the real binary, hosted, the way a person
# would: it types into `codeaf chat` in a terminal of its own and reads the
# screen and the folder back. A surface change is accepted on this, never on a
# test with a stand-in agent: what a stand-in proves is what the stand-in does.
#
#   scripts/hosted-drive.sh <path to bin/codeaf> [folder to keep failed screens in]
#
# IT MAKES REAL MODEL CALLS, so it is never part of `make check` or any default
# target. Run it by hand, after `make build`, when a change touches the run, the
# side list of tasks or a task's page.
#
# WHAT IT NEEDS: tmux, git, python3, and a key the product can find, either in
# the environment or in your profile's config file. Everything it makes is
# thrown away: a home of its own, a repository of its own, and a tmux server on
# a socket of its own. It never writes to your own home folder's state.
#
# YOUR KEY: the drive copies your profile's key into a private temporary home,
# readable by you alone, and removes that copy on every exit: a pass, a failed
# check, an interrupt. Nothing else the product writes there carries the key.
# A screen kept from a failed check has any key the drive knows struck out. It
# knows a key by a field whose name says so, or by an environment variable that
# ends in _API_KEY. A credential kept under any other name it cannot know, so
# kept screens are private files: read them before you share them.
#
# WHAT IT ENDS, and how it chooses: its own tmux server, by its own socket's
# name; and the engine the chat started for this home, found as the process
# holding THIS home's own socket and ended only when its executable is the
# binary you named. It selects no process by the text of a command line. On a
# system with neither `lsof` nor a table of sockets to read, the engine is left
# alone: it leaves by itself once it has been idle, or you can end it.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS, in the order it happens. It exits with the number that failed.
#
#  1. Two tasks are handed off six seconds apart, with an unsaved file of your
#     own in the folder. The side list is opened with its own key first when
#     your profile starts a conversation with it hidden.
#     - While the run works, your folder holds only your own file.
#     - The run works in one copy of its own, kept under the conversation.
#     - The second hand-off joins the first and shows on the side list.
#  2. The run ends and its work comes home.
#     - One new commit holds the run's files.
#     - Your unsaved file is untouched and still unsaved.
#     - The run's copy is given back.
#     - No task branch is left behind.
#     - The landing card says merged, and never that a branch was kept.
#     - No row on the side list is still running.
#  3. A task handed off after the run has ended is a run of its own, and the
#     first run stays readable.
#     - The first run's record is kept beside the live one.
#     - A press on the first run's row opens that task's page over the
#       conversation, with the task as it was given.
#     - No id of the record's own is drawn on the page.
#     - A note left on the ended run is answered in words, not dropped.
#     - esc returns to the conversation with your draft as you left it.
#
# The checks below are small functions handed BY NAME to `check` and
# `wait_for`, which is a call the linter cannot see.
