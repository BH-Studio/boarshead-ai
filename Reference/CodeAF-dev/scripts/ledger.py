"""Assemble docs/design/polish/LEDGER.md from the per-surface audits beside it.

The audits are where a defect is written down in full: what it is, the line
that decides it, why it costs a developer something, the fix shape, the
severity and the frames it was seen on. The ledger is the one ORDERED list the
owner reads, so it is GENERATED from them and never edited by hand — an edit
here would be a second copy of a number that is already written down somewhere
else, and a second copy is a copy that will drift.

A row CLOSES when the audit that holds it names its number under `## fixed`,
which is the same thing as saying it closes on a captured before/after pair,
because that is what a lane has to put there. The spellings below are the ones
the lanes actually write — a table row, a bolded number, a `Row N` heading —
and a spelling nobody uses is not worth matching.

# heading gate above never sees that, so the row counted as done in a ledger that
