#!/bin/sh
# clean-run.sh opens bin/codeaf as though it had never run on this machine,
# except that it still knows who you are: your settings (models, crew,
# services) and your keys are copied into a fresh state root, and nothing else
# is. No conversation, project, task, memory, standing order or notice from
# ~/.codeaf is there, so every try of a new build starts from the same place.
#
# The state root is moved with CODEAF_HOME (internal/home), which moves every
# file codeaf writes and leaves HOME alone, so git, your shell and caches
# outside codeaf behave exactly as they do every day. The copy is left behind
# after codeaf exits, and its path is printed, so a run can be looked at later.

#   CLEAN_INTO=<dir>       use this folder instead of a fresh one (emptied first)
#   CODEAF_BIN=<path>      the binary to open (default: bin/codeaf beside this script)
