# THE OLD READER, KEPT AS IT WAS SO THE CURRENT LOCK IS TESTED AGAINST IT.
#
# Below this header it is scripts/one-suite.sh as it stood before #1264, with
# ONE change: the lock path. The original hard-codes the box's real directory lock
# under /tmp, and a test that drove that path would take or break the lock every
# other session on the box relies on. So this copy refuses to run unless it is
# handed a private path, and scripts/one-suite_test.sh always hands it one.
#
# The file is named one-suite.sh on purpose. The old liveness test accepts a pid
# only when its command line contains that name, and the old reader must find
# itself alive exactly as the real one did.
# ONE HEAVY SUITE PER BOX AT A TIME.
#
# Nine sessions fired `go test ./...` at once on 2026-09-02 — a load average of
# a hundred, thirty-seven go test invocations, a hundred and twelve test
# binaries — and the reds that came out of it were manufactured by the load:
# packages cut off by a timeout that was fine on a quiet machine, races that
# only lose when the scheduler is starved. A timeout under that load attributes
# nothing, and a red under it proves nothing. So a whole-tree run and the two
# heavy packages, internal/tui3 and internal/session, take one lock. A second
# run on the same box refuses to start and says who holds it rather than joining
# the pile and reporting a red nobody caused.
#
# THE LOCK IS A PID WITH ITS COMMAND LINE CHECKED, not a path's existence. A
# session that died mid-run must not leave the box locked, and a pid that was
# reused by something else must not either; the lock is stale unless the pid
# is alive AND is still running this script, and a stale lock is simply taken.
# The Makefile invokes this wrapper for a full `make test` or `test-report` when
# PKGS contains `./...`, `./internal/tui3` or `./internal/session`. A
# `test-focus` selector and lighter packages do not take it, so cheap,
# independent proofs remain independent.
#
# The file is per box and per user, under /tmp rather than the session's own
# TMPDIR, because the point is to see the other session's run and a TMPDIR is
# exactly what sessions do not share.
set -euo pipefail

# The lock is a directory, because mkdir is atomic where a check-then-write
# of a file is not: two starters in the same instant would both see no holder
# and both write, and the first to finish would remove the other's lock.

# AND THIS SCRIPT EXPORTS NO STATE ROOT OF ITS OWN.
#
# An empty CODEAF_HOME for the whole run is the obvious answer to a test that
# reads the machine's real state, and it was tried and dropped, on clean dev,
# with the measurement: an empty home turns `internal/lane` green and
# `internal/rtk` red (its resolution order wants the managed `~/.codeaf/bin/rtk`
# to be there), and `internal/resident` red as well (a recurring-skill check
# that fails only when the package runs in sequence under the override). The
# packages disagree about what a state root should hold, and each is right about
# its own subject, so no one environment satisfies them all: a wrapper that
# picked one would trade a red somebody understands for a red nobody does.
# Isolation belongs at each package's own resolution seam, which is where #475
# put it for `internal/lane`.

# WHAT THE WRAPPER DOES OWE THE RUN IS THAT IT REALLY RAN.
#
# `go test` answers a package it has already run with the same inputs out of its
# cache, so a heavy suite can report an earlier tree: a package whose red was
# fixed by something the cache key does not cover still reads red, and one whose
# green was cached reads as a proof nobody performed. A heavy run is what a
# person quotes; it says nothing unless every package in it actually ran. The
# caller may say otherwise — only a caller that named no count gets this one.
