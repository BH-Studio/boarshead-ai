# ── the furrow that rides inside ────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# EVERY codeaf IS A codeaf WITH FURROW, so the build fetches furrow before it
# can produce one. This step downloads the release pinned in
# internal/furrowbin/pin.json for whatever platform is being built for, checks
# it against the sha256 the pin names, keeps it in a gitignored third_party/
# cache, and stages it gzipped where go:embed picks it up. Six megabytes of
# binary is not committed — every clone would carry it forever — but the pin
# beside it is, so what shipped is auditable from the repository alone.
#
# It is a prerequisite of `build` and not a thing anybody remembers to run. A
# fetch that cannot happen STOPS THE BUILD, loudly, with the command to run: the
# failure mode this ordering exists to make impossible is a quietly successful
# build that produced a codeaf without furrow inside it.
#
# On a machine with no network, point it at an artifact already on disk — the
# sha256 is checked either way, so this is an offline road and not a looser one:
#
#   make furrow FURROW_ARTIFACT=~/.agentfield/bin/furrow
#
# THE TARGET IS READ FIRST AND THEN UNSET. A cross-compiling build sets GOOS and
# GOARCH for codeaf, and the fetcher has to know them — but it must not be built
# FOR them, or the build machine tries to run a Linux tool and reports an exec
# format error where it meant to report a download. So the two are captured as
# the platform to fetch and taken out of the environment the tool is built in.

# The symbol table and DWARF are a third of the shipped binary and nothing at
# runtime reads them. Stripping costs symbolized panic traces, which is exactly
# what `debug` keeps — build that when a stack trace is what you need.
#
# -trimpath drops the build machine's absolute paths out of the binary. The
# build stamp deliberately gives separate builds separate bytes, but neither
# carries the machine-specific repository root. What trimming costs is
# compiled-in repository roots: a lookup that walks up from its own source file
# with runtime.Caller can no longer find a tool checked in beside the tree. A
# shipped binary's compiled-in root never exists on the machine running it
# anyway, so any such lookup has to fall through to the copy beside the cwd and
# then to PATH — which is what it does here.

# quietly return — IT IS READ HERE AND ONLY HERE, and an absent file skips
# nothing. `make test`, `make test-laws` and both workflows go through this one
# reading, so "green locally" and "green in CI" are one fact. Before 2026-09-02
# they were not: this target was a bare `go test ./...` that could not pass on a

# ── the demo home ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# A HOME WITH SOMETHING ON EVERY PLACE, FOR LOOKING AT. On a machine that has
# just started using codeaf the standing store, the memory store and the
# spending ledger are empty, and every one of those pages correctly draws
# nothing — which is the emptiness law working and is also indistinguishable
# from a page that is broken. This builds a THROWAWAY home somewhere else and
# opens the real binary against it, so all of it can be seen full without a
# single invented row landing in ~/.codeaf.
#
# It prints the directory it built and the command to open it again, so the same
# home can be returned to:
#
#   make demo-home                              a fresh one in a temp directory
#   make demo-home DEMO_HOME=/tmp/codeaf-demo    build it somewhere you can name

# ── the size ratchet ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# THE BINARY HAS A BUDGET AND THE BUDGET IS CHECKED IN. A megabyte of embedded
# prose, a dependency pulled in for one function, a corpus that stopped being
# packed: every one of them lands as bytes nobody measured, and the only moment
# anybody would have noticed is the moment it was added. So the number is read
# back out of the tree on every `check` and compared, which turns "the binary got
# fat somewhere over the last year" into "this change added it".
#
# IT GATES `check` AND NOT `build`. A developer iterating rebuilds twenty times
# an hour and must never be stopped by a byte count; the end-of-change ritual is
# where a size is a decision rather than an interruption.
#
# THE BUDGET IS A FILE BECAUSE A CHANGE TO IT MUST BE A DIFF. Raising it is
# allowed and sometimes right — a feature is worth its bytes — but it is a
# reviewable line in the same commit as the thing that spent them, never a flag
# somebody passed once on their own machine. PERF.md carries the same rule for
# every other cap in this repository.
#
# The measurement is bytes and not seconds, which is the doctrine PERF.md states
